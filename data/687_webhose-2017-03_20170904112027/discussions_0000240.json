I complained to reception and told that no manager was available and that as nothing was stolen it was a simple error. Our passport and money was in the room\nWas very noisy cleaner hoovering outside door at 8am on Saturday morning and constant noise of lift going up and down\nNot once did any staff member saying Hi or were we ok. Checked us in and said room was at the bottom on the left.\nPoor service and the room was not that of a 4star.
