I had to carry my bags up the stairs the bellman was speaking with someone. At check in I was informed the suite I reserved wasn't available and all that was available was a regular king because of overbooking. The suite had 2 rooms and a kitchenette. Breakfast (in restaurant not room service), wifi and the possibility of moving to a suite if during my 4 day stay becomes available. Room was paid in full though Travelocity who I informed of the issues. Last time I stayed here, also for a week, the suite and view were nice but there was no heat in the hotel and they said there was nothing they could do about it, so I guess two times burned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:57:38.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
