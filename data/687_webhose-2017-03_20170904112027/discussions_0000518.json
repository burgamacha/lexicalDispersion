I received what I thought was a pretty good deal for a week’s stay (I booked through booking.com). My mom and I arrived at the hotel later in the evening and we requested an airport transfer through the Hilton. Unfortunately getting through customs at Heathrow took hours and our driver waited around for us but we were very delayed. When checking into the hotel, we were advised right away that we were going to be charged for the pick-up delay. We were immediately off to a bad start. We advised that we would not pay for something that was out of our hands. After that, the gentleman checking us in felt bad for starting off on the wrong foot so he offered us complimentary drinks and food in the bar area ( I will speak about this shortly).\nOur hotel room was lovely and large. The beds appeared to be comfortable but were not the greatest to actually sleep in. The bathroom was very modern and large as well but the shower was odd (hard to figure out and the shower door was just awkward). There was often a large amount of water on the floor after a shower! There was one very large issue- the fact that the room/floor smelt like rotten eggs. We thought it would pass but it didn’t and we in fact met other hotel patrons who complained of the same thing. We suffered through it for a day or two but then couldn’t stand it. I complained to the front desk and they eventually allowed us to switch rooms. I found out that they were doing construction on the floor right above us and that meant taking out the toilets… hence the gross smell. While I was thankful for the switch I had to check out several rooms before I found one that didn’t smell. To be frank I was very confused why they put us there to begin with when the smell was very apparent as soon as you got on the floor- especially since we were going to be there for a week! Not cool.\nIf I go back to the story about the free drinks and meal at the beginning of the trip, I recall ordering a charcuterie board and a bottle of wine. Half of the things that were listed on the menu didn't arrive! I also don’t believe we were properly served the wine (small amount poured and tasted before proceeding) which I thought was pretty much expected at any bar especially in a hotel. Also, don’t recall getting side plates for the food. The same thing happened when we ordered a cheese board into the room. Very bizarre. Speaking of food, for all of our troubles with the stinky room etc., they actually offered us a free membership to the Executive Lounge. I thought that was incredibly generous of them and we definitely took advantage of the free drinks and food. I actually thought the food selection was excellent- I had much lower expectations. The view from the rooftop patio was also fantastic- albeit it was too cold during the time we went to sit outside.\nLocation wise- I thought this hotel was well situated. It was just a short walk from London Bridge station (5 mins) the Shard and was a very short walk to the Tower of London. In fact, if you walked along the waterfront there were tons of little booths set up selling food, drinks etc. It was quite lovely. I will say that other than that there weren’t very many food options right by the hotel. If you walked north towards London Bridge station, there were more options and in fact, you were right by Borough Market which I loved. I also walked to the Tate Modern from the hotel, the Shakespeare Globe and the Sky Garden building.\nWhile I appreciated all of the gestures taken to try and rectify all of the issues we had, I will likely never stay at this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:00:42.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
