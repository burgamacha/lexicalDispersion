On arrival the woman on the desk was very rude not welcoming at all had a very stand off attitude. There was nobody there to help assist with the bags to the room. We were meant to be staying in a premier room- it was incredibly basic. There was no mini bar in the room, the air conditioning was useless and the cleanliness was not acceptable for a hotel in the middle of New York rated 4 stars. I went to the concierge one day to ask for advice on the subway the woman barely uttered 2 words at me and handed me a bit of paper with instructions on. There was no restaurant in the hotel either just a very basic grab and go service. I lost my key one night and went to the desk to ask for another the woman on the desk did not try in help in the slightest her words were \" no ID no key\" overall a very very disappointing hotel we 100% won't be back.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:58:45.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
