The front staff did not exude warmth and were disorganized. Found a pistachio nut on the carpet floor and hair on the tub and toilet when we checked in. The room provided was small for a family of four. I requested an additional towel and it arrived 2 hours later after I called them again with a more serious tone. Bathroom faucets (hot and cold) didn't work well. Couldn't sleep due to noise. Will definitely not go back to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:20:10.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
