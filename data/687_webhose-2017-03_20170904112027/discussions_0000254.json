We walked everywhere. It does not get better then this because you are close to everything but it is quiet at night.\nThe hotel is in a historic building and the building, the lobby and common areas look charming.\nThe staff is multilingual, attentive and courteous.\nWe stayed in a Deluxe Suite #203. It is spacious and clean.\nThe room does not look like the picture on the website. It is in dire need of updating. It looks and feels worn out and not in a good vintage/antique kind of way but in an old and dingy way especially the faux wood panels.\nThere is a seating room and a bedroom - neither is comfortable.\nThe furniture in the seating room is not comfortable and after a day of exploring the city on foot it was difficult to relax.\nThere is a desk and an ottoman but it is not possible to work behind it without a proper chair.\nThe bed is uncomfortable and slightly slopes to one side. As one other reviewer mentioned, out of 5 pillows 4 are hard as a rock, and one is softer but it doesnâ€™t provide any support.\nThere is a hole in the wall in the bedroom. It looks like there was a picture there at some point...\nI could not relax or get comfortable anywhere in the room throughout our 3 day stay.\nThe windows are very small and have mirrors all around to create an illusion of a bigger size but it does not look good.\nWe did not eat at the restaurant but order room service once. The food was good.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:36:45.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
