The third ‘bedroom’ was actually the sofa bed in the living room, this would have been fine however when the sofa was converted into a bed it took up the entirety of the space in the living room and in fact blocked the exit for one of the rooms (which surely must be a hazard in the event of a fire).\nBedroom one was very spacious but the bathroom was quite small and the shower cubicle was very tiny. The second bedroom was very small (the bed literally spanned from wall to wall so to get in one would have to climb from the foot of the bed). The bathroom however was very spacious.\nThe hotel are obviously trying to fit as many people as possible in the rooms however we felt this was being done at the comfort of their guests.\nOne additional point worth raising was that they charge €90 if you want your room early, we arrived at the hotel at 2pm and check in is 3pm. It was raining quite heavily outside and all we wanted to do was freshen up before going back out to brave it. No give on this at all and we were advised we would have to pay the extra if we wanted our room a mere hour earlier (we would have understood had we asked for this 3 or more hours early but felt this was a bit unreasonable given the room was available).\nOverall this wasn’t the most endearing experience and I would not stay here again should I return to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:43:58.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
