My 4-night stay at the Paris style room was not a comfortable one mainly due to the impractical interior design. I had issue especially with the bathroom. Rain shower was nice, but why no shower door the closed completely or even just a shower curtain? I had to mop the bathroom floor with towel to prevent water from running outside the bathroom after taking a shower. And there's no space to place my toiletries, not enough towel rack for two people. There is a big closet (bigger than necessary) but no nightstand next to the bed. There's no place to put even a glass of water. For some reason, the bed lamps hang so low that I had to be careful not to hit my head with it when I woke up. These all may sound like very minor complaints. But every little detail adds up. I didn't feel relaxing at all after coming back from long day of sight-seeing.\nService was okay and location was great. But, I won't stay at this hotel again when I revisit Paris.\nRoom Tip: Don't book the Paris style room.
