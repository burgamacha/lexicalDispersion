There's none of that.\nFirst, there's no air in the room. So, don't even think about relaxing or cooling off. It's like a sauna in here. Have the thermostat sat to 64. But, it feels like 164. Yes, I can crack the window open- then it's a giant wind tunnel, since we're high up and it's like 20 degrees out.\nThe bed is as hard as a rock and the pillows are non-existent. Very flat, lifeless pillows that are impossible relax on. Also, I might get more comfort out of laying on the concrete outside than this bed.\nI highly recommend not staying here. It is so bad, they really should give me a refund. It's unbearable. I am a Hyatt Platnium member, or whatever the new program calls me now and I really am thinking of bringing my loyalty else where.\nRoom Tip: Stay somewhere else See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:01:58.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
