We had booked 22nd of February instead of 22nd of March.\nAnyways we asked the lady manager to book us a room for the current date. The lady offered us a suite at 3 times the price of a normal room. We only had one night to spend there....it was 9pm and all we needed was a place to crash. We explained to the lady that we had not planned that much of money....the reaction of the manager was very cold....no help at all. Fortunately there were other hotels nearby and we managed to get a very decent room at 1/3 of the price that were offered by the Days inn. Days inn did look nice and promising however attitude of the manager should be reworked....the other staff looked much more friendlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:42:51.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
