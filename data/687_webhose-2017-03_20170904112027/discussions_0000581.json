We called the hotel to NOT ask for a refund but to simply change our dates since we were rescheduling for a future date when we are healthy enough to travel. It was really hard to get in touch with a manager, we tried calling for 3 days prior to our reservation and was not able to get in touch with one. When I finally spoke with a manager he just said \"SORRY, but we can't do that\". I have been working in the hotel industry for a long time now and have come to learn that if management really wants to help you they can, in this case sadly they did not. Now we are forced to lose our $1,500. Won't ever book with them in the future, they were not helpful at all!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:31:24.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
