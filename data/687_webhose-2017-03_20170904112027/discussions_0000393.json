When we arrived, the front desk employee couldn't find our reservation.He said we got none.Then he found it under my husband's name,but I did the reservation.We only stayed 1 night during the weekend.The hotel is very nice, as well as the rooms.But you would not expect the hotel room to be 58 F in a 4 star hotel, when outside temperature was minus 8 C/17.6 F. We arrived frozen to our room from freezy cold outside with big freezing wind. The room was very very cold and the heating was not heating anyhow ! You would not expect this from 4 star hotel anywhere ! Even the electric kettle was broken so couldn't make a tea or coffee first hour or two.We called for a heater & electric kettle. Fortunately, we got it. The room was still not very hot with the small heater and the bathroom was very cold too with no heater whatsover. We got delayed a few hours just warming up ! Also we felt the freezy cold coming to our room the entire stay !!! The top restaurant is fantastic and the views from room too. But They put us only to 4th floor. Disappointment ! I would never choose this hotel again ! Next time I would stay closer in the city in Marriot or next to Empire state building and near Central park to be closer to everything.\nRoom Tip: Choose room with a view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:23:15.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
