Our flight arrived early in the morning and there was no room available at the hotel. That's usual, no prob, so we went for a long walk. Hours later we came back to check in around 3 pm, extremely tired, hoping for a nice shower and a good nap and it was the worst deception ever! an awful tiny room with zero space, no privacy, no wardrobe, nothing. The bathroom was the smallest place in the world, with no privacy, no door, a disaster. they sell it like it is a nice value, cheap, but for what they offer you, it is not. because every minute there is awful, it kind of ruins part of your trip. You just wanna be outside and never get back at the hotel. I travel a lot and stayed in other bad hotels in my life but never got so disappointed and uncomfortable like this time. We've been to NYC many times and tho was definitely the worst place I've stayed.\nRoom Tip: There's no good rooms in this hotel, they are absolutely tiny See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:48:31.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
