The fantastic pocket wifi system is very convenient and easy to use. There are also a lot of spare pillows and duvets.\nThe disappointments (keeping in mind that I paid 160€ for a night): noise isolation is bad (anything happening in the corridor will be very well heard) the shower is seriously too small (I'm not fit and it was not easy for me to get in, and then I was involuntarily changing the water thermostat with my body just by turning around) it (the shower) is also old, with stains here and there, you can see they do their best to keep it clean and welcoming but it's the kind of stains that don't go easily (see pic). Also the toilet seat is in soft flexible plastic that slides a bit when you sit on it. The bed sheets had black stains on the side (see pic). The breakfast has no scramble eggs nor other warm food options (but good cheese and croissant).\nI see that you can get that room for 54€ some times, for that price I would go for it, that's a good value (if they avoid stains on the bed sheets) But for a business trip at the parc des expositions, when the prices is above 80 or even 150 per night > never again!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:30:36.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
