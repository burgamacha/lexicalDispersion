Charged me for another occupant. Told me they were waiving a late check out but didn't and manager refused to release the 25 back to my account after explaining to her it was waived. No shower curtain upon arriving, vent fan was howling , had a maintenance man in my room for 15 minutes after arriving. Got sick from the breakfast , the food was stale. Front desk girl was sassy. Worst experience ever in a hotel. I am calling cooperate and the better business bureau on them. Never once was I ever charged for another occupant in a double occupancy room. I am so angry. I was told this upon check in after already giving them my card and paid. If I don't get reimbursed or refunded there are going to be major major problems. Very very very bad management. I am so disgusted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:56:40.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
