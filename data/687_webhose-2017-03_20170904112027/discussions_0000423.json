The executive room was the only one available, the price was decent, and the other rooms looked like shoeboxes in size so I went with it.\nPros\n1. The location is great, walking distance to Earls Court metro train station\n2. The size of the executive room is decent in size for London. I couldn't imagine any smaller, and I was travelling alone. The other rooms must be the size of shoeboxes, I wouldn't stay in those as they would be tiny.\n3. The shower pressure is good.\nCons\n1. Upon entering the room, the toilet was dirty and had a excrement stain. Not the first thing you want to see in a hotel room. Disgusting.\n2. The toilet seat did not stay up. After trying to fix it, the whole toilet seat came off, so I had to try fix it myself. I got the seat back on, but the toilet seat does not stay up. Had to hold up while going to the bathroom.\n3. The breakfast is terrible. Supermarket dry and tasteless croissants, and got charged 2.49 pounds extra just for a cappuccino coffee which tasted terrible. I had the breakfast once and didn't bother again.\nNot much about the room was executive. If I was going back, I'd stay elsewhere next time even though the price and location was decent.\nLondon Lodge, please improve your breakfast and your room cleaning services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:11:34.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
