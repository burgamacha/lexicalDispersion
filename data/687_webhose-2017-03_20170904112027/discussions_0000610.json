I then let them know the mini fridge was boiling hot to which she replied \"and what would you like me to do about it\"...this was our first night! It was mad! there was an unsealed hole in the bathroom wall, they also would not let us take our key away from the reception which we reluctantly accepted after saying just how uncomfortable we were with it, breakfast was overpriced and not great compared to the other options around so we opted to go out each day instead, room service had nothing available so again went out instead, Don't get me started on parking, the only reason he booked the hotel was because we brought the car and needed one with a car park, so they advertise parking but this is SO far from the site, if you don't know the area, its so easy to get lost, he was so angry and showed me the booking to prove what he had booked, We absolutely LOVED Paris, the sights, disneyland.. it was all so romantic every part perfect (honestly apart from the hotel), we had planned that we would relive this romance every year and I think we still plan too but we will be staying so far away from this hotel, all of its staff and what it considers \"hospitality\" ... Evelyn.. i'll never forget her, that woman needs a job that keeps her away from other people, though there is another gentleman with glasses that works in the evening time but he was also rude so a good tip would be to not visit reception at any point of your stay, actually a good tip would be to not stay at all, honestly book another hotel and save yourself the aggravation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:50:55.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
