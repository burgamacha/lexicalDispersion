In its favour the beds and bathrooms were clean and the rates were cheap for Paris at about €50 for a twin room. The rooms were very cramped and the staff not overly friendly although able to give the required advice in English. The RER was about 15 minutes easy walking away but the area from hotel to station and around the station were intimidating enough in the daytime. You would never venture out at night. I was in a group of rugby supporters so we had no problem but would never bring a family to this area or hotel. Even our group decided to use taxis rather than risk public transport late at night and that incurred a €30 fare per taxi. You should add that fare to the room rate and get a hotel in a better location.\nRoom Tip: If you have a twin room make sure that there are only two beds in the room [sardines] See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:17:34.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
