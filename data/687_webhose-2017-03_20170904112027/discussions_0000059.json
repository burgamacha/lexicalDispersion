Very bad experience. Rooms are tiny but that is not the issue. Staff is horrible. They charge to keep your bags. They charge if you arrive 15 minutes before 3PM. Shower drains do not work and shower are become a dirty water pool. I killed a spider in room. Corridors are a mess because they have to store their operational stuff there. No daily cleaning of the room. That is why I suggest you to look for another option. There are many other hotels in this area.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:12:03.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
