Family of 4. We stayed 7 nights in March 2017. Upgraded to a Jr Suite.\nPros\nGreat downtown location - just across street from Ground Zero and very close to subway, restaurants, shopping, etc\nStaff were kind and helpful, esp to kids\nOur one in-room dining experience was pretty good\nJR suite views and layout were good for a family of 4\nKids loved the pool\nCons\nThe JR suite was badly in need of rehab: grungy, worn, frayed and stained carpet, stained couch cushions, peeling wallpaper, rusty bathroom fixtures, light bulbs out in bathroom vanity, dirty grout, and worst of all stained sheets on bed! Ugh! Even the TV screen was super dirty. We are not very picky but it was BAAD. We complained and asked to be moved (we were there with our young children after all) but the other room offered had similar issues. My wife, who stays in this location often said the regular King rooms are not quite as bad in terms of wear and tear.\nOther thing we didn't like is that there is STILL construction at Ground Zero, which starts before 7am, 6 days a week and is VERY loud. (This is clearly not the hotels fault but it's a factor to consider).\nRoom Tip: Great views from JR suites, east/south facing would be quieter vs west/north See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:51:32.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
