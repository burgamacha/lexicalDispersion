Anyway, had a nice sleep in this room until I got bitten by a red ant and found many of them in the room.\nAgain, the staff was nice and moved us to a superior room (which was nice) and offered us breakfast on the next day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:14:30.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
