The man on reception suggested burger king. I explained we wanted more of a restaurant but he insisted it was \"very nice\".\nWe had requested a room on a high floor but we're allocated a room on 1st floor adjacent to the lift which was noisy and disruptive\nI plugged in my phone on arrival and it was apparent there was no power to the plug sockets. TV was also not working.\nI went to reception and the gentleman advised I hadn't put the key into the slot. I told him I had (all the lights were on) and he reluctantly followed me up. Upon visiting our room, he agreed there was an issue but advised someone had turned them off. He then went to rectify it and our electrics worked Soon after.\nWhen I got into the shower the next morning, I realised that there were no toiletries in there. I asked at reception later and was told they should be in there. I advised that they weren't and was given some soap / shampoo.\nBreakfast was very pleasant, probably the best thing about our stay. Location was fantastic but I wouldn't stay here again due to a real lack of concern for the guest experience. Front desk staff were ambivalent and uninterested, significantly less so with the French guests I noticed. That being said, we only saw three guests during our 3 day stay which made the room allocation /late check out issue even more strange.\nCould not recommend based on my experience I'm afraid", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:00:01.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
