As a Accor platinum member I am supposed to get welcome drinks and since they don't have a bar I was asked to take one from the fridge that was located in the reception.. and they only had different types of water.. it was pretty hilarious.\nIn short, just not worth your money.. go somewhere nicer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:50:39.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
