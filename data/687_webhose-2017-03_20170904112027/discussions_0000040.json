The furniture was old, the carpet was old, the bathroom fixtures were old. This place is in desperate need of a make over.\nThe tv would lose signal all the time and freeze.\nWe were on the 22nd floor and we could still here street noise and had trouble sleeping.\nI didn't find the staff overly helpful or friendly.\nWould never stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:31:10.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
