Even paying in GBP this room was expensive. The room was beautiful but the air con was clearly not working. The initial solution was a portable air conditioner that sounded like a 747 was in the room. Three further calls and a trip to reception the problem still wasn't resolved, I was made to feel that I was just making a fuss - easy for the receptionists to say as their open air reception was as cold as a fridge ! We had a guest come for dinner with us and so I phoned reception to organise a taxi home for him at around midnight, the night porter told my husband that there were no more taxis and suggested that we download the uber app and organise our own taxi. The pool bar closed at 4pm without anyone telling us- our solution to getting some more drinks was to use our UK mobile phone to call the hotel reception and get them to send someone to take an order. On check out the general manager was not available to see me however I was promised he would contact me that same day either by email or phone as I was unhappy that I had been asked to prepay the room charge on check in and now didn't feel that I had had my monies worth. 10 days later I am still waiting for this call. If you check my profile you will see I travel extensively and stay in some amazing places- this hotel is simply not worth the money", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:45:11.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
