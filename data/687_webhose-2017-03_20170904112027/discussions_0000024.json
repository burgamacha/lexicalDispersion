There are groups of homeless men that live within steps of this hotel. Streets are covered in garbage, food, clothing, and human waste. My daughter said \"it smells like a porta potty that both humans and animals use\". To get inside the hotel you must be buzzed in. You can not use a keycard to get in. If they don't hear your buzz you are locked outside with the scary groups of homeless. You can actually sleep in the open about 50 yards from the door to the hotel. Usually they ignored the tourist, however on a few occasions we were either confronted (in a language we don't speak) or followed. I am normally not afraid of the homeless, this is different. They have small makeshift homes set up. And they are outside morning, noon, and night.\nRoom Tip: Do not stay here See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:10:21.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
