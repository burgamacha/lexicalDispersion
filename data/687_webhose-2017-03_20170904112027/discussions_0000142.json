I was told there were no rooms available despite my pre paid reservation. They offered to put me up at a different downtown hotel. I told them that I preferred to stay here, given I was attending a conference at the hotel. They said there was nothing they could do, despite other travelers, who arrived after me, getting rooms. They put me in a cab without telling me or the driver the address of the other hotel. The $10 they provided didn't cover the cab fare. The situation was poorly handled and I hope other travelers don't receive the same treatment that I did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:49:04.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
