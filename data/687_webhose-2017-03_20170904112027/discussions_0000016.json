We've stayed in Mercure hotels before, so thought this would be ideal - opposite the Gare du Nord - ready for our journey to start the following morning. If this was the first Mercure we'ed visited - rest assured we would never be going to another one! The room was really small, and the carpet had so many stains over it. The woodwork looked as though it hadn't seen paint in years. And there was only a few small lamps in the room, which didn't give enough light to read. The tea making tray was pathetic. 2 plastic cups for water, no spoon - just a wooden stick! 2 creamers only, so 1 each for either tea or coffee. And the wardrobe door didn't shut properly. The only good thing about this experience, was the breakfast the following morning. The entrance to this hotel was plush and luxurious, which made us think it a good choice initially. It became obvious - very quickly - that the money had been spent on the foyer area and NOT the rooms - well at least not the one we had.\nRoom Tip: Don't choose a room at the front. Way too noisy!!
