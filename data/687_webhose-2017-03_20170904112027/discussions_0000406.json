The room was tiny, the shower was cramped and there was no hot water on the first morning. The room, on the 4th floor, was extremely noisy all night, the windows are not double-glazed and there was considerable street noise. Housekeeping obviously didn't function well - no water bottles in the room despite the tags that were supposed to be on them being there - and the room wasn't cleared of glasses etc after the first night. It should be noted that we were offered a complementary breakfast and staff were apologetic, but for an Accor hotel we felt this was nonetheless very disappointing and we would not stay at this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:34:57.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
