The staff is very confused and all over the place trying to manage ten things at the time but not really managing anything. I stayed in the smallest room ive ever experiensed in a hotel clean tough. Also you could hear the underground train quite clear eventough I stayed at 3rd floor. Dont expect the wifi to work in the rooms.\nThey charge you to have your luggage stored after you check out which Ive never experienced before. The hotel name changed to Point A recently but their tripadvisor is not up Yes so be aware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:26:03.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
