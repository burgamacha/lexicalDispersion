It was recommended by a family member.\nThe location is central but there are many ither hotels with a better location than this.\nThe room furniture was oudated. A couple of nights later was asked for the room to be changed, we paid for an ipgrade to same size of room but with different furniture.\nThe room AC wasn't well positioned so we felt very hot at night. The solution was to open the glass window to let some cool air in.\nThere was no water kettle in the room, so it was impossible to make tea or coffee when needed at the odd hours of the day or night. So frustrating.\nFor a coffee or tea you need to go down to buy it from the cafe near the lobby.\nThe lobby itself was like a busy market most of the time, noisy and loud.\nCorridors were many times full of noisy school children staying in the hotel as part of group travellers. The kids were very loud at night we had to call the hotel staff to deal with them.\nWill not stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:50:05.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
