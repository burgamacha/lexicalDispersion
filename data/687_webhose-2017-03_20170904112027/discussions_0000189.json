The hotel is in a good location and it has the potential to be very good but our stay was ruined. I could overlook the broken furniture in the room and stains to the carpet, the Â£200 holding deposit no one tells you about but I can not accept the attitude of the staff. Our stay was ruined by the staff allowing a number of guests to use the central courtyard until the early hours of the morning. If it had been until midnight or 1am I could have dealt with it but serving drinks outside in a central courtyard from a private hotel guest only bar until 3:30 in the morning is unacceptable. Then proceeding to clear up the glasses and slamming the doors at 4am takes the biscuit. A staff member then took a personal call out in the courtyard at about 5.30am. The bar and courtyard are supposed to close at 11:30pm so be warned that this doesn't happen so if you have an internal facing room you are going to disturbed. I raised this with the reception staff the next day and was basically told I was wrong and it wasn't from the hotel. I could see the people in the courtyard from my room so I argued the point. I received a mumbled apology and I asked for this to be looked into. I didn't receive a response and am still waiting. We were also rudely asked on more than one occasion as we sat in the reception waiting for a friend what were we doing there as if we had just walked in off the street! I won't go into the fine detail of other issues except to say they are house keeping related. Would stay in this location but not at this hotel.
