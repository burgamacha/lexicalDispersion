Obviously we will not stay again but take caution when booking here. We were lured by lower price. Major problem during this particular stay was the partying that was going on at the bar till 4am then moved to our floor (10th) till 5:30am. Doors slamming, shouting, screaming. Called the front desk but no luck. Also, do not get a double bed, at least for rooms ending with 3 or 4.
