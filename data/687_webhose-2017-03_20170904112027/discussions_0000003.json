It is not the first time and because of my travels I'm sure it won't be the last. I have always used Marriott Hotels for years because of the comfort and courtesy and because of all the money and time spent on them I have earned the Executive privilege. I was the first person to enter the lounge of the hotel mentioned above and after about 5 minutes the woman decides to ask me for my room number. 6 people walked in right after me (that did not look like me) and she never once opened her mouth to ask for their room number. I brought this to the attention of the front desk and they told me it is policy for her to ask for the room number. I told them they are full of it because she didnt ask anyone else for their room number and how would I have gotten in without a key. Marriott Opera will not see me again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:12:55.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
