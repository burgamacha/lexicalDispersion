Water backed up in the tub and would not drain while using the shower. On our second day, we were away from our room from 9am until 3:30pm. We returned to unmade beds, no clean towels or replacement of paper products. We had to call down twice to finally get housekeeping service. Afterwards we noticed that she left one set of clean towels for two people. This was such an inconvenience as we wanted to relax for an hour before our evening plans. The outlets were not in convenient locations and the entire room including the floors were quite dusty/dirty. I expected so much more from this highly rated hotel. I will say, the entire staff (except for housekeeping) was extremely friendly and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:08:13.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
