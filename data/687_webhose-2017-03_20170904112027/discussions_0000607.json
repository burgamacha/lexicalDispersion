From room service to cleaners everyone made the effort and was so lovely.\nThe hotel itself is in a great location right on Leicester Square, and surprisingly the hustle and bustle of the square doesn't make it through the windows.\nThe hotel rooms themselves are frankly very tired. Chips in the bathroom and marks and scuffs on the bedroom walls show the hotel has seen better days. For a 5* hotel charging these kinds of prices, it's not really good enough.\nAlarmingly, there are ongoing building works both inside and next door to the hotel, which seems to be expanding. These aren't mentioned anywhere, but start up at 8am and are inescapable if you aren't using some industrial strength earplugs! We also had the treat of the fire alarms going off twice during our stay, with the requisite fun after of all the firedoors in the corridors being shut and the lifts out of action.\nIt truly has the potential to be a great hotel, and after refurbishment and building works I think it may well be, but at the moment I'd pass.
