We talked to the general manager of the property and she told us to take a hike. We then called customer service and still have not heard back from them.\nTo top it off, when I rated them poorly on the Holiday Inn site because of this, Holiday Inn refused to post my rating saying in was irrelevant and inappropriate.\nThey don't want the truth just nice comments.
