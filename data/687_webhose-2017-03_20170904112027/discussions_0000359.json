There are good things about the hotel, but unfortunately the negatives were more, at least for me:\nGood:\n- Hotel is beautiful\n- Location is very convenient\n- Staff was very nice and friendly\nBad:\n- Room was extremely hot (in March), A/C did not work and window opened just a little bit to an interior space with no air circulation.\n- Wifi was not usable: I couldn't do any video calls with my family (dropped after a few seconds) and couldn't login to my company's VPN (this has never happened at any other hotel I've stayed at).\n- The room was beautiful, but not functional: clothes armoire was extremely hot, probably because of the small fridge inside it; desk was very small; there was no place to put bag; the toilet seat room (separate from shower/sink) had little ventilation.\nRoom Tip: Ask for an outside facing room (indoor rooms have poor ventilation).
