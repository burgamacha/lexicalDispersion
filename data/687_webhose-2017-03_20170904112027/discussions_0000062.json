The minute I got the email confirmation, I called the hotel to explain the mistake. I also explained how, even if I wanted to get into the city today, I couldn't because of the snow storm that has resulted in all transportation to NY being suspended. The only bus service near us has canceled all buses until tomorrow.\nAfter talking to the rudest manager ever (who snidely said I should have better control over my child), the hotel would not make any concessions. Luckily my Chase Sapphire card came to the rescue. But if this accounts manager is in any way representative of the kind of hotel The Court is, I'd stay FAR away!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:00:33.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
