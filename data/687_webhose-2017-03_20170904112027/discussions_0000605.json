To be honest, ive stayed in better hotel Ibis Budgets. The location is not very desirable and I felt quite unsafe walking around the streets round the hotel. The hotel was clean but the bathroom situation is dire - open bathroom, no lock on toilet door, see through shower. Not great when you are staying with your friends! No plugs around the mirror to dry hair, etc.\nHOWEVER, we wanted a budget option as hotels in London are very expensive, and we got what we paid for. Clean hotel, quite helpful staff and near to Aldgate East Station so your about 20 mins from central attractions and nightlife. Not too bad but not great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:20:03.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
