The lobby was beautiful as others have mentioned; the room itself was nice. Great location. That's where my compliments end...\nThe hallways smelled like smoke; the drinks at the bar were watery and service was slow; the bellhops that held our bags for us on the last day said to us, \"I work on tips, you know\" and stood there until we gave them cash (all 4 of us -- we were going to give him some when we picked up our bags, to compensate for the work he had done -- I'm not going to pre-pay!); the in-hotel gift shop had crazy prices & a $10 minimum, the rooms were advertised with complimentary water and coffee but we had neither--for all 4 days; the bathtub didn't drain; the Wi-Fi was spotty at best.\nBut the VERY worst part was the heater. I thought I'd booked a room in NYC but apparently we booked a room on the surface of the sun. The heater would not turn off and was blowing such hot air (even when you tried the 'cool' setting) that we were all drenched in sweat every night. I called the front desk; they sent up an engineer who was very rude, ignored our concerns, told us to open a window if we were hot, and left. I went down and complained the next day and the woman assured me it would be handled or we would be moved. When we got back to the hotel that night, the issue was not resolved and they said there was nowhere for us to move. I complained again on the day we checked out and all she said was \"I'm sorry. Have a great day.\" For this kind of money AND a $21/day 'resort fee'...at a \"4-star\" hotel....I expect far better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:37:24.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
