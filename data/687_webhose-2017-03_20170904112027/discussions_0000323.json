The room was heated with a small electric heater and you ended up getting either really hot or cold during the night. The room was very tired looking, the bathroom really needs a revamp. The double glazing and additional glazing does not keep the sound of the jets taking off at the nearby airport and expect to be woken at 5.00am by the trains! The only good thing about this hotel was the breakfast, there are certainly better hotels in the area and my company will be booking somewhere else in the future, it is worth paying the extra money to get a good nights sleep!!\nRoom Tip: Don't go on the top floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:38:02.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
