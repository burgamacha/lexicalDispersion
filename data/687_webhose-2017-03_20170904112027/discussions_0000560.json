Everything about the hotel is absolutely fine apart from temperature in our room which was way too hot. There is no way of changing it apart from opening the window which let all the noise in. We spoke to the reception the next day and they said they will see if there was anything they could do. When we returned that night the temperature was the same but they had managed to block a window open so we had the noise and the heat! Not good, we didn't sleep well at all after a busy couple of days. I think that the sauna must have been directly above our room. I wouldn't recommend for families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:36:15.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
