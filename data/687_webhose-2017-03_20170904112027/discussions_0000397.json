Arrived late and noticed there were no bottles of water which sucked. In the morning discovered there was no shampoo, conditioner or body wash. They bought some up but it made me quite late. Being charged to leave my bags was incredibly frustrating - I have never stayed in a hotel that has done that before. I realise these are minor problems but they make a difference when you're staying in a different hotel every night.\nThe room was fine and a decent size. Location is good too.\nI'm a Hilton member and stay with them regularly in various countries. The details described above let this one down. They could easily change the luggage policy and I really hope they do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:50:04.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
