But for two nights we were prepared to take the risk due to its good location close to the Forbidden City. The amenities weren't too bad and the heating worked really well. Unfortunately the cleanliness of the room and the bathroom were the issue. There was long black hair on the floor everywhere and I only braved the shower once I put the towel inside it and still wearing the flip-flops. There was a foul smell coming from the drains in the bathroom, especially bad in the mornings. From what I could see at least the bedding was clean.\nThere's a really nice lady at the tour desk, she speaks good English and was one of the very few kind people we encountered during our visit in Beijing.\nIf you can pay a bit more look for a better quality hotel, if you can't, come with low expectations and spend as little time in the room as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:29:05.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
