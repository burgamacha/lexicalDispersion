Staff were very nice but for a $450/night hotel I was beyond disappointed. Rooms are old and dirty and small. Found mold in the bathroom. Shower had hot water at night but in the morning the water was too cold to wash my hair. When we asked they said it's because too many people shower in the morning and they run out of hot water!!! At 9am no warm water. At 10am no warm water. We had 2 rooms, they offered us a refund on one room for 1 night but refused to give us a refund on the other room. It still doesn't justify not having warm water to shower with. Don't stay here unless you don't mind a quick 5 min cold water shower!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:21:04.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
