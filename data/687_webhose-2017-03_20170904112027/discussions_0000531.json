Dark gray walls with bright green doors and the moment I stepped in, I got super claustrophobic. The room is tiny - not NYC tiny but tiny I'm 5'5 and when I sat on the toilet - my knees touched the wall - yikes.\nNot for business either - trying to find plugs was a challenge. The insulation was not good so I got to hear sirens, horns and trash trucks all night long. If you're under 30 - go for it. Also - even though the room price is relatively low (as it should be), the cost of food/coffee/etc. is expensive - $5+ for a cup of plain coffee and don't be surprised by the $30+ \"hotel fee\" (essentially a resort fee) for a whole lot of nothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:50:39.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
