It being close to our office, the location is the single reason why I go back. Whether for conference or a night or two while in Kampala, the service is always such a colossal disappointment. It could not be colder or more lackluster. The check in is often slow and unfriendly, the restaurant staff are incredibly unhelpful and often rude, the sales and conference teams are just not up to the task of service. The facility (particularly the restaurant and upstairs conference rooms) is not disability friendly. Myself and colleagues have lost items in the rooms on several occasions - and unless you throw a complete fit - you can be sure you will not receive any assistance. When scaling up to management - theirs is an air of indifference at best and disdain (with possibility of racism) at worst. I also do not deem their unsolicited practice of displaying the names of return guests at the elevator is at all appropriate. My colleagues and I repeatedly provide this feedback to them, and we have seen very little effort to make things better.\nI will commend them though, for providing free ironing service - that is quite helpful, and also for the drinks and food selection at the buffet meals. They have what it takes to be a great hotel, but their service is their biggest let down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:27:01.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
