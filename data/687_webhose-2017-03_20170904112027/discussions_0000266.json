Changed rooms and that room made a noise, noise checked by the engineer who would call the front desk to advise to move again. That didn't happen so I went to inquire, front desk didn't know anything. Moved to another room which was small but without faults. The manager apologised and offered 1 free breakfast. Breakfast is average but expensive. Check the prices well before booking because the fees presented are not including things like facility fees (wifi & gym) of USD 30 per day. Overall disappointing despite the effort of the manager. You don't willingly put people into rooms with defects, that is just not right.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:54:47.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
