So the window looked like its going to fall off from the ledge, hence I called up reception and ask them to send someone to check. The technician that came was EXTREMELY RUDE and he was so arrogant when he explain to me how the window works.\nThe hotel breakfast was average, not much choices, the fried noodles are too salty while the other food are either too oily.\nThe location is too difficult to call a cab and all the shops around closed after 10pm.\nOverall i would NOT recommend anyone to stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:22:56.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
