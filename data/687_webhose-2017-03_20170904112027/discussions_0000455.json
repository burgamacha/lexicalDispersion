Called la Quinta in the evening to cancel and they said - oh well we will still charge you!\nI told them about everything being cancelled and all they could say is- we are very strict about cancellations, you should have called at 3pm! Hello! We didn't know our flights were going to be cancelled. I called them at 6:30 as soon as I knew. Mind you this was the day before, they could have absolutely filled the room.\nAnyway- they could have worked with us but chose not to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:44:10.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
