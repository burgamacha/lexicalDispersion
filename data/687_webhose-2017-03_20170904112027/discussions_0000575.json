Unfortunately before going to Rome with my husband, my Mother-in-Law passed away. We had paid already for the reservation and even though we sent the Death Certificate to them, after so many emails and communications they didn't care and just gave negative answers about returning the money asking us to pay more money if we wanted to keep the reservation arguing that in the month of September (when we could afford to go) was going to be high season. The money we had paid was for non-refundable rate. They couldn’t return at least 50% or 40% of the money in such tragedy like that?? Give me a break. BUT...in the other hand, we had the same situation –non-refundable rate- with a Hotel in Barcelona, we explained the situation to them and they returned the whole amount of money without hesitation. You have only ONE mother and in some specific and sad situations you can show you are human too. I am sure that if you go to this heartless hotel they will see you just like a bill, coin, check, credit card or travel check and non like a guest who are given them the money to eat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:53:42.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
