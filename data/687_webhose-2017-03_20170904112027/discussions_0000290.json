The room is medium, nothing good or bad. The breakfast is also not special, but that is not the problem.\nFor me it is unclear why the restaurant doesn't work during the weekend. It is possible to eat at the bar, but it is always crowded and you wait for service for an unreasonable length. Besides the wait, the prices are way to high. How is it possible that in France they can not serve a decent glass of wine? Even more, they charge 11 euro for a half empty glass full of sediment, apparently no one told the bar staff not to poor everything out of the bottle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:42:23.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
