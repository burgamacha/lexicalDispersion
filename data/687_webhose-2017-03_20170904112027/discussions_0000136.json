Especially when the bell boy knows not to give out her name.\nWe're here for 4 days for my daughters birthday and I'll be contacting BA in the morning in the hopes of escaping this place.\nSee the pics for the prison style room but even the stupidly expensive studio has a half bath that's ridiculously old and worn and chipped furnishings.\nNot the best start to what should be a celebratory trip but outside this nightmare building will make up for it and I'm hoping we won't be staying.\nPics below of the bathroom, so small it doesn't have a door, just like the wardrobe, the tv is mounted on the mirror at a 90 degree angle and the width of the room is pretty much the bed.\nThis really isn't the place to stay.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:02:33.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
