The Courtyard by Marriott at 866 Third Ave in Manhattan gets rounded up to a 2. I decided to stay here based on location and platinum Ritz Carlton status.\nSometimes you just need to admit you made a mistake.\nThe room was over $400 a night after tax and small even by NY standards. The TV didn't work and neither did the internet upon check in. I stay in hotels 150 plus nights a year so it isn't a matter of not knowing how different hotel systems work.\nI called the guest services line and got a snarky response that all I needed to do was hit the channel \"up\" button twice and everything would be fine. Nine tries of turning the TV off and and on and trying that was enough. I walked down to the front desk and was told that \"a lot of the remotes don't work\". She called \"engineering\" - they brought me a new remote that worked fine. After 20 minutes the internet finally allowed me to log in but even with the \"fast\" $16.95 day internet option; I found it like stepping back into the 1990s speed wise.\nI fully understand many people give this hotel good ratings but all I can write is my honest experience. As far a I am concerned Marriott owes me for false advertising. If this is really the Marriott brand, give me Hilton any day.\nRoom Tip: Stay somewhere else See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:37:06.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
