We all wanted to stay in the same area. Some stayed across the street and some stayed at the Iroquois. The rooms were small, as expected, but I was not prepared for the dark and depressing feeling in the room. There is a big difference between being true to the historic style of a hotel room and just having old stuff. My major complaint was the lighting inside our room. If there had been better lighting available in the room, it would not have seemed so dark and dirty. The bathroom was small and outdated. No counter top.\nWe were told that they are renovating some rooms. So ask for a new room.. or bring a flashlight to find items in your suitcase! With some updates, I believe the historic and gorgeous building could be grand once again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:00:10.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
