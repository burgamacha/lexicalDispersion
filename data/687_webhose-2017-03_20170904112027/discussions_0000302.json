The food did not cater for everyone which was understandable, however the staff would not give out any more spoons and we were left to eat cold eggs with the bottom of a fork.The dinner was lovely with a large variety of foods. There was one staff member that was excellent help and was really nice to us. Our rooms were small but very clean,it was way to hot in the room and there was a huge window with a tiny opening onto a balcony so we could not even go out to the balcony when it was so hot because there was no door. I cannot comprehend how rude and ignorant the staff were. We were treated with such disrespect i could not believe it. Any time we would leave our room to go down for breakfast or dinner and we laughed we would be shouted at by the staff. Our door was kicked by another guest at about 9pm to be quiet. I did understand that there was a lot of young girls but nobody was disrespectful back to them. I would not recommend staying in this hotel unless you are going solo as the walls are paper thin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:17:41.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
