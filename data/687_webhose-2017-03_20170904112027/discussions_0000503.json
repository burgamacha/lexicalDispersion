The rooms are small and dirty, the windows were semi open at all time and the only way to keep a normal room temperature was to the let the aircon on all the time. The noise from the street (was at 13th floor) and the aircon was overwhelming and let to a sleep deprivation. The last day we got an extra bill/invoice of 35 dollars per day, even though we never used the daily 10 dollars “discount” on all drinks from the wine bar or any of the other services that they provide. It is both dishonest and wrong. But overall the nasty and rude staff is the main reason not to choose the Hudson Hotel ever.\nRoom Tip: Don’t go there!
