Must admit I hadn't read the reviews before booking . After booking I started to read the reviews and was starting to think about changing my hotel . So glad I didn't . People are saying the rooms are small . Well there was two of us in our room and there was plenty of room and space to put 4 cases . The location of the hotel is superb . I would definitely stay here again when I return to New York .
