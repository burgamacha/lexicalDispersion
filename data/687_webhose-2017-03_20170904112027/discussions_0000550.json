The room rate is around $200/nite, but the couldn't find anyone who would help? So we dragged the luggage down to the storage room, with the intent that our son would pick it up later in the day. He arrived and asked the front desk for the key for the storage room. They never asked him for ID, and didn't accompany him to ensure he only took the correct luggage. He could have emptied out the storage room. Whoever described this as a glorified hotel hit it on the head. And parking is around $50/day, there is no local shuttle bus, no breakfast, no meals.
