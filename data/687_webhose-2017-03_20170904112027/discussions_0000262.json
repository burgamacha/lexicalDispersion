However my experience was pure disappointment. In saying that though, the hotel is well located, the Grill served a lovely meal and yes the views from the Boom Boom room are spectacular but that is where it ends.\nThe staff are stand offish to the point of being rude and uninterested, guest access doesn't guarantee you access to Level 18 or the Beer Garden and the room I was allocated in was noisey with lots of pipe sounds and music from the Boom Boom room.\nAmenties in the bathroom were sub standard for a hotel charging this amount per night. Also be warned, if you are sharing a room with your partner and have issues being seen and watched having a shower ask what type of bathroom your room has.\nThe only shining light in this place was Tim - one of the concierge staff other than that the rest of the stuff need some retraining in customer service skills.\nRoom Tip: Mid floors are best See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:59:57.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
