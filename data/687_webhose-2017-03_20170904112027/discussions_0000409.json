Dirty napkins are left on the table as is. Ironing board not kept, iron on the floor.\n2) Concierge operates till 9am to 7pm. Outside those hours, you're pretty much on your own.\n- I asked about airport transportation at the front desk (concierge has left). Told me I could just flag a cab at the ground floor. When asked whether I can pre-book the transport, I was given a number to call myself, bearing in mind there were 2 staff at the front desk and no other guests around.\n- The next day, I asked whether the taxi to the airport is fixed price or by meter, the front desk person said she does not know?!?!! Told me to ask the cab driver myself before boarding. Again, no guests around. No initiative to call to enquire of any sorts. You're basically on your own.\n- First day, I asked whether there are any coffee shops around that I can grab breakfast, the lady just told me there's plenty around and I can just look it up myself!\nAnyway, it seems that the front desk staff are better off being replaced by robots as they do NOTHING else except process check in/out. I know this is not a full service Hilton but even though, the service is really poor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:23:53.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
