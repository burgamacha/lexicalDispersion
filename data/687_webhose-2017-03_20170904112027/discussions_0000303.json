Whilst the renovations are much needed - the hotel is shabby, the disruption is significant. Laundry bags are piled up in corridors. Corridor carpets paint stained. I was woken just after 5am by repeated banging from one of the walls of my room. On closer inspection the noise seemed to be coming from a pipe. It continued for about an hour. There was also continuous banging and disturbance around the room through the very thin walls from 5am. Service so far poor to non-existent. I'm typing this while calling the 'gouvernante' room service - ringing unanswered for over 15 minutes. I'd strongly advise travelers to Paris not to stay in this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:24:15.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
