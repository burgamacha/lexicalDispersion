The carpets were utterly repulsive, and the whole place had a odor that was very unpleasant. The room was so tiny that you couldn't open the door without hitting the bed. It was very, very cramped. Additionally, the walls were soiled and the towels were stained. The bed was not comfortable and the sheets were musty. The staff was friendly albeit unattentive. The rooms also were very loud and I could barely sleep. It's worth noting that the location is nice but that's hardly worth it. I would never stay here ever again, nor would I recommend this to anyone I know ever. I've traveled extensively in the country and internationally, and have stayed at some hotels in Asia that cost me $10 a night that were spotless, so there is really no excuse.\nRoom Tip: Don't stay here See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:12:45.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
