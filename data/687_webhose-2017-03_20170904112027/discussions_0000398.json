This hotel is really conveniently located in walking distance to Times Square, Broadway theatres and much more. Also i really appreciate an idea of having a kitchen in the room. It saves you some money and you can cook some simple meals.\nThe worst thing about this hotel is sleeping quality. Bedding is old and smells dirty. The pillows are terribly smelly. I wanted to wash my hear every morning to erase this smell. Another \"feature\" you need to be prepared to is their heating system. It is very loud and wakes you up every time when it starts.\nBe also prepared that service is nonexistent in this hotel. Don't expect that they will replace your bedding/towels every day or that they will clean the room. No, they wouldn't - this is their \"point\" as they advertise themselves as \"long-stay\" hotel. While you pay the same as you would pay in a \"regular\" hotel, some service is still very much needed. Such as removing your garbage (i asked for this twice, but our garbage was removed just once...), changing towels or bedding. When they change your towels/bedding, it doesn't mean they \"change\" it - you come to the room and find the new stuff on the chair/bed. And your used towels just stay on the racks.
