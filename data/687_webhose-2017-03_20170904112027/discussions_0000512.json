I had a single room on the ground floor. Was a little put off by the lingering smell of someone else's trainers and thought I was in for either a stinky or noisy night with the window opening onto the street. As it was the road was quiet. The mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable though. But after a day racing around an exhibition at Olympia, I was too tired to care. What I did care about though was the fact that the reception staff took a photocopy of my passport and refused to give it to me when I checked out. Why do they need this? They said it was common procedure in London hotels now. Not in the ones I've stayed in it isn't. With identity theft on the rise, it has made me feel quite insecure and nervous. Having booked online and paid in full and proven my identity on arrival, the hotel should have no need to prove who I was in the event of some police procedure later on. I won't stay here again. I'd rather travel further and know that my identity is safe and than put up with the insecurity I now feel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:44:12.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
