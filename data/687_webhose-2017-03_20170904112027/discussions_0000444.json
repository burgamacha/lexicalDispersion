On our first night the tub did not drain during a shower and the water filled up to about a foot. Our fridge was also not in working condition. We called down the next day to see if we could switch rooms and they informed us that they would prefer to fix the problems while we were out instead. I usually prefer my privacy and would have preferred just to switch rooms but I agreed. When we returned the tub was fixed but the fridge was not. We wanted to chill and enjoy a bottle of champagne on our first trip to Paris but unfortunately that didn't happen. When we called down again that night we were told there was no way to switch rooms because the only rooms available were better than ours and more expensive. In addition to everything there were big yellow stains on the mattress. I want to imagine we were not sleeping on a urine stained mattress but... They brought us two comped bottles of water and allowed us to check out late for the inconvenience.\nNow the positive. The rooms was a good size and most of the staff was very friendly. The chocolates on the pillow and the towel warmer we're a nice touch as well. The location is the main draw for this hotel. It is located very close to The Louvre and the area around the hotel is lovely.\nBottom line is we expected more from a four star hotel. For the amount we paid everything really should have been clean and in working order.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:44:29.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
