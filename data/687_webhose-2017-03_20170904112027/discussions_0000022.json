Both check-in and check-out was done fast, with a smile, and without any problems. The simple breakfast was of good quality, and the coffee from the coffee machine in the breakfast room was surprisingly nice. My room had a water boiler including instant coffee and tea. There was a small safe, a minbar and plenty of pillows in the beds. The hotel is perfectly located close to the cozy Rue Daguerre and close to Denfert-Rochereau RER station, bus stops and metro stations. Room 107 was rather quiet, the view was into a back alley.\nThe wi-fi was very unrealiable and often painstakingly slow. The hotel in general is dark and gloomy, both when it comes to choice of colours (dark brown more or less everywhere) and the amount of lights. Especially my room was annoyingly dark: I once lost my iPhone on the floor and spent 5 minutes looking for it! There was one easily accessible power socket in my room, so I had to unplug the TV in order to charge both my laptop and phone. The toilet and the sink are located in two separate rooms, that's quite strange and rather unhygienic I think. The holder for the shower head didn't manage to hold the head in a fixed position, so it was quite a job to take a shower. The faucet knobs for the shower was mislabelled. The air condition didn't work, or rather, it could only heat the room, not cool it. This might not be a problem in February for other than a Norwegian... The bed was too hard for my liking. My room desperately needed to be refurbished.\nIf this was a 2 star hotel I would probably have been quite happy with my stay, but being a 4 star hotel it didn't live up to my expectations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:59:00.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
