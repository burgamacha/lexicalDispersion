An information sheet in the room would be great. The room i was in (141) had a single bed, a chair(full of grime), a side table, a tv (french only) and a toilet with a sink. -the area outside the hotel at night is pretty rowdy and having ventured out (to buy air freshener) i witnesses prostitutes working and pimps fighting so i wouldn't recommend it for families.\nIn general the room was small but this is to be expected for the cost and of course being in paris a lot of rooms are small however if this room had a fresh lick of paint, fresh bedding and the bathroom modernized it would have been more pleasant but unfortunately as it was i found it to be the worst hotel room i have stayed in as it was more like i was squatting in an abandoned room from the 60s The staff were nice enough and the main stairway looked like it had been freshened up but the room was terrible.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:21:43.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
