We checked in late so didn't even think of the noisy street until we went to bed, we felt like we were sleeping on the street the noise was unbelievable. Next day ask to change room, which we did. The room was hot, I opened the window while we were out figuring the room would cool down. Came back at 10:00 PM had to put the a/c on. mind you it was 20 degrees outside. Took about 15 minutes to get hot water in the shower. This is my 3rd try at the Hotel Belleclaire, they need to update the heating, a/c and hot water. Not worth the money!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:14:02.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
