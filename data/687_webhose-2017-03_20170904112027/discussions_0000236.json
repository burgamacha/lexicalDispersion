There were delays with our flight and the airline was supposed to give us vouchers to stay in a room and eat 2 meals. After an hour of the hotel staff staring at me like I had 10 heads, they eventually found us a room to stay in. When we went to the restaurant, the food and service was excellent. After I returned home, I found there to be a charge of $80 on my card that was never supposed to be there. The hotel was to send all billing to the airline. They then told me it was for the cost of my meal!! I only ate $50 worth!!! This was never supposed to be charged to my card anyways! When I asked the other guests that had been staying with us, one had a charge for $10 and the other one had nothing. Explain that! How do you justify $10 for a meal but the others were covered? And I paid $80?!?? Where does any of this make sense?? When I emailed the company, they told me this was a charge for my meal which it shouldn't have been. They were going to reimburse me but never did!! It's been 3 weeks since I was there and I have been waiting for them to sort their mess out. I feel like some shady happenings are going on there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:37:24.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
