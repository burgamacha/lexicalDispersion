Overall the staff and the room are lovely. Beds are comfortable. However I really think the walls are made out of paper. Every single sound you can here. We arrived to the hotel after a long haul flight and almost been awake for two days. To be woken by loud people after 3 hours sleep. Called reception and nothing happened. We are on the first floor. I feel like our hotel room is in the reception. They play music there all night and turn it off in the morning? I think it should be the other way around. Our second night here. The same thing to be woken after 4 hours sleep. I had to call reception again to complain. Said they would go to the room. But I don't think they actually did. I had to keep banging on the wall to get them to keep down. But nothing worked. We even booked a room when a view and balcony. And got neither. I also don't understand why there's a curtain over one window and not the other. Safe to say I would never recommend this hotel. Such a disappointment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:18:52.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
