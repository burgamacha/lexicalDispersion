This has long been one of my favorite hotels but it it time to change. The carpet in my room is dirty, bed skirt and decorative pillows on the bed are dirty and worn. Shower curtain is dirty and wall has dust and dirt balls clinging to the wallpaper. Tile is cracked and furniture is chipped and scratched from wear and tear. This, accompanied by a room , two rooms away from the elevator shaft, and I can still hear the loud roar of the elevators, every time they move. The standards of this once fantastic hotel, have certainly changed and not for the better. I am not sure if the management has changed, but I truly advise to choose another. In all fairness, after a rather challenging call with the front desk clerk, I finally got to a manager and was moved to another room. Quieter, but still worn. Pictures attached, judge for yourself. Sad, as again this has been a favorite for many years.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:40:28.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
