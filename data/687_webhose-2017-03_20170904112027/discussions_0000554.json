We arrived, and to our dismay the rooms were quite small and not at all what we had seen. The rugs were disgusting, to the point that we did not take off ours shoes in the room. The amenities look cheap; I would be better off sleeping in my dorm room. Very disappointed with this place, I totally do not recommend staying here. There are far better hotels in New York for a better price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:57:00.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
