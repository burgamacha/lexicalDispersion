The price was ok for the location and the reception staff were friendly but the hotel itself is really run down. I think we were there in the middle of renovation works as the floors were covered in plastic sheets, there was a strong smell of paint and we were woken up at 9am on Saturday morning by sawing. I wouldn't usually mind but we were not informed of this beforehand, so some common manners wouldn't go a miss.\nThe room attendants were ridiculously loud when cleaning in the mornings which also woke us up and the walls of the rooms are really thin, with the rooms close together which meant we could hear every shut door, TV etc from the room next to us. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a couple, only stay if you are there a short time and really don't mind where you stay.\nAir con was also poor, the room was boiling and there is not enough light prevention on the windows in the room or bathroom.\nReally disappointed with the hotel but like I say, it was important we had a good location by Paris North station, and I think they know they can get away with a run down hotel because of this.\nRoom Tip: Bear in mind the lift is small and can only really fit one person with luggage.
