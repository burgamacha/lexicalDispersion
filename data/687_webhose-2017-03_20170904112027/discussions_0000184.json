Firstly, the smell of sewerage wafted through the shower drainage every time I turned on the shower. There was also the smell of sewerage in the lift area, which almost made me dry reach. Secondly, the carpet in my room emitted a smell of mould and showed large water stains which looked quite unappealing.\nThe hotel's credit, the reception relocated me from the first room I was assigned (which had a terrible smell of cigarette smoke and mould). However, the second room I stayed in presented its own array of delightful smells.\nIf you plan to stay at this hotel make alternate arrangements for internet access, as the hotel's wifi is incompatible with Android devices. This seems nonsensical if this hotel is accommodating guests from abroad.\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel. As a long time Accor customer, I strongly urge Accor to review the Novotel Beijing Peace as I do not believe this hotel building meets the standard that Accor aims to deliver.\nRoom Tip: pay extra for a suite See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:56:01.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
