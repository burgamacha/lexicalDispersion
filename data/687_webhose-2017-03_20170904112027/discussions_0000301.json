It looks like this place was neglected for years. The walls, floors, carpets were in disrepair. I have uploaded a picture of the chair in our room which clearly demonstrates the lack of maintenance.\nWe wanted to watch Grammy's but could not get that channel to work. We tried other channels and the picture quality looked as if we were in a third world county.\nwe were told that the TV does not work well when everyone is watching the TV.\nWhen we asked why our room was not cleaned and stocked, we were told that they service rooms every eight days as they are suites. If that is the case, why did this hotel appear in a search for a three day stay.\nHad one working elevator for 30 floors. We came down to level one after waiting for a while and before we could get off the elevator, the elevator started going up and went back to 19th floor before it came back down.\nIt took for ever to get hot water and after running the faucet for 10 minutes, the water was barely warm . When I flushed the toilet the flush was jammed and I had to fix it to make the flush work.\nI will never ever stay here again even if they offered the room free.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:41:41.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
