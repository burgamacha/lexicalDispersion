I found the rooms to be musty, dated, dusty and aged, especially all that wood, the bedhead - that seems to have never been dusted, the wooden robes and table. Old old old TV's like 20 years! Bathroom was ok, reasonably clean. Not sure why this hotel has small boutique hotel award anything, I was not impressed by the rooms. The doors are so old and heavy and as a result loud when your neighbours show up at all hours. Despite the convenient and excellent location, would not return here.\nRoom Tip: There is a construction going on directly next door, a new condominium See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:46:46.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
