I've stayed in other Ibis and Accor hotels in France, which weren't too bad. They seem to be aiming at the bottom of the market in the U.K.\nTo be fair the room was clean, the bathroom was a plastic pod affair ( reminded me a bit of the transporter room on the starship enterprise ) but a few homely touches wouldn't go amiss. Especially as Â£140 for one night was hardly bargain basement prices.\nFeel just a bit moany about this one. Accor had better up their game. Low cost doesn't have to feel like a prison cell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:35:02.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
