First of all, the bellman don't care at all about helping you. I travel with a large 80lb pelican case and a few suitcases and asked for a cart to be brought out, was met with an annoyed attitude by most of the staff. After arriving to my tiny room, not a big deal, I asked for ice and never received it until calling 3 more times. The heater kicked in at 2am and would not shut off, causing me to have to open the windows so I wouldn't need to call and ask for help. The next morning the blowdryer broke, and when I asked for help again from the staff I was transferred by the operator 3 times before then being hung up on. These are a few of the many issues I managed to encounter during my less than 24 hour stay. Amazed a 3 star hotel at the prices that the Wellington is charging could manage to treat guests so poorly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:47:01.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
