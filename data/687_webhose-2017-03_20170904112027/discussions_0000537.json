I was given a suite, which sounded good, but was so TERRIBLE that I could not even stay in it for one night. The couch was horribly uncomfortable and there was no TV in the bedroom part. I was told there were no feather pillows, which later turned out to be false. As well, the balcony looked out on nothing. When I went down to say I was leaving, they came up with a much better suite, which was very nice and modern. However, I needed to stay two nights and the good suite was only available for one. As well, when I requested a toothbrush, they brought me a box with a toothbrush on the outside, but q-tips on the inside. When I called down to tell them, they argued with me, and said that they had delivered a tooth brush. When they finally came with a new toothbrush, the staff member had egg on his face, as he saw that indeed the box I had received had the wrong thing inside. The next night they shoveled me into a so-called deluxe room, which was like a mousetrap, with plugged drains and few amenities. To add insult to injury, I did not have breakfast but was charged for it anyway. There are an infinte number of better hotels in Paris for this price, and right around the corner from this one, where the service is much, much better. Give le Mathruin a big miss.\nRoom Tip: Stay in a bigger room if you absolutely have to stay here.
