Apparently they do not deal with people over the phone.\nThe apartment was in the basement with no natural light and a window which overlooked a wall. You couldn't open the windows as it would have been a security risk.It was hot and airless. The sofas were incredibly uncomfortable.\nThe list of faults is endless:\nNo bath plug - I asked for one but was told they weren't provided. You couldn't go and buy one because they are non-standard. So basically even though they advertise a bath, you aren't allowed to use one. The bathroom shelf was grey unpainted metal and covered in rust. No remote control for the TV and non-standard channels so you had to scroll through hundreds of channels whilst standing by the TV in order to find the channel you want. Bath enamel was chipped, floor and carpet was dirty. There wasn't enough cutlery for the 4 people who were allowed on the booking and there was only one wine glass. Toilet seat was loose Heater in lounge wasn't working. Toaster was missing the knob and ALL of the pictures on the wall were hung really crookedly, showing a complete lack of care.\nThe location and size of the apartment was good - but that is about the only good thing I can say. It was so depressing that I left 2 days early. No way is this a 4 star standard apartment.\nRoom Tip: Don't stay here!
