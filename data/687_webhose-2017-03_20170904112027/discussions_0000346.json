While the beds are comfortable, the rugs are disgusting and dirty. There are spots everywhere throughout the halls and rooms. The amenities are sparse, my complimentary water was opened when I arrived, my stir sticks for coffee and plastic cups were never replaced. One of my light bulbs was out in the bathroom and I notified the front desk the first day; it was never fixed. The buffet breakfast is a cattle call with a 30 minute wait. The bartenders were friendly but drinks were pricy and small (and yes I realize drinks in Paris are not cheap.) When I come back to Paris, I will definitely stay at something more upscale and clean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:40:13.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
