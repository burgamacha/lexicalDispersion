The hotel was average price, centrally located, the breakfast buffet is good and the staff was friendly. The Wifi was also good. Now the bad. The rooms were small. The view from your window is of the building across from you. The beds were uncomfortable. The walls were thin. The drainage and water pressure of the hotel is problematic. Don't flush the toilet while taking a shower. The shower was clogged and flooded the bathroom and bedroom. I informed the staff but the carpets were still wet when we returned. A bid deal if you walk around barefooted. The view from the roof is great but during winter months the bar is closed on the roof. A big deal since they advertised the roof as a selling point. The elevators are small like most of Paris hotels. Some of the rooms share a main entry door like my room did. So there are two doors to go through to enter your room. So when someone leaves their room you hear two doors slam shut. Not good if your trying to sleep through the night. Also for some reason the hotel was changing all or most of the beds in the hotel. A real pain when your trying to walk through the hallway. I'm a real easy going person, but until this hotel gets its act together or they offer you a bottom basement price that you can't refused, I would stay away. Not worth the price we paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:53:34.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
