Yes, if you choose to stay in the Times Square there will always be an element of this, but the building is very poorly looked after and none of the windows seal. This let's in lots of noise that just shouldn't be the case, almost like there is no barrier to the outside. and if you stand no chance of sleeping in a hotel what's the point?\nSecondly - the rooms. They feel tired and grubby, and the ceiling and walls have marks where condensation has run down them. Just a bit gross really. Lots of the lightbulbs weren't working.\nThe service from staff is brisk and generally not very friendly, which I found unusual compared to stays elsewhere in NYC.\nLastly- the resort fee thing is just stupid. It's clearly an added charge to just squeeze extra cash from guests, and it's very confusing and absolutely caused complaints from others while I was in reception.\nAll in all, you're better off looking elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:07:54.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
