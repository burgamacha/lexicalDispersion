Our room was without any of the nice amenities customarily available in first class hotels such as bathrobes and a stocked mini-bar (ours was empty) to cite a few. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was a long time in coming as the Hilton and Marriott shuttles passed by twice as we waited in the cold. We were told (by an airport wheelchair person) that the Hyatt shuttle usually passed by every 10 minutes. We waited more than 20 minutes.\nBreakfast service in their dining area was, with the exception of the bus-boy who brought coffee, slow in coming to take our order and was anything but first class. I ordered a bagel which came without any jam or butter. Only cream cheese was included.\nBased on the room price of $325 we should have chosen another facility like Embassy Suites where breakfast is included.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:51:35.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
