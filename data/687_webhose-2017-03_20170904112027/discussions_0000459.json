This was my first time in the Doubletree Westminster, and I was looking forward to the stay. I had a queen room with lounge access. On check in, it took about 5 minutes to get to chat to the receptionist. On check in the receptions ( Bernadette) was absolutely lovely and excellent at her job, and advised me that the lounge was open. I checked in , and went to my room, which was a double with small bathroom, but very adequate, and the bed seemed comfortable. I went to the lounge on the first floor. On arrival it is a windowless room, which feels quite cramped. There is no spirits available, but free wine and beer is available from 6-7:30. The canapes were adequate, nothing special, but edible. The white wine ( Pinot Grigio) not so much, but the bottles of London pride were very drinkable.\nOn the closure of the lounge I decided with my friend who was also staying in the hotel to go to the bar where they had an offer of Â£6.95 fat frog cocktails. I ordered two of them at the bar and we watched them being made. They each comprised 1/3 of a small bottle of a cheaper version of blue WKD and a 1/3 of a small bottle of Smirnoff ice, with a dash of pineapple juice, and 8 ice cubes. This was completely a rip off! I made a comment to the barkeep who was unpleasant and less than helpful. We had our drink ( due to the small volume could it be defined as this...haha) and left.\nOn the nights sleep, it was quiet with a comfortable bed and an adequate bedroom. I would have rated it 3-4/5 however due to the awful bar service I could not do this. I had expected good things from this hotel, but there are multiple better Hilton and doubletree hotels in London at a similar price with better rooms, facilities and bar!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:05:53.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
