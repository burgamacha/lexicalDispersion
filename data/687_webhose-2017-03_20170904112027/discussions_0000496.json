Rooms are a good size. Hotel is pleasant. Rooms are clean. This review would have been so different if they cared about customer service.\nThe negatives:\n- the front desk staff are rude. I dealt with a number of them. Three men were very rude. Two others offensive and rude.\n- External noise is minimal. Internal noise is loud. If you're jet lagged don't try and sleep, the staff yell to each other from the corridors. And you can hear them on the room phones when servicing rooms.\n- Three times the amenities such as shampoo and conditioner were not replenished and had to be requested.\n- Room key stopped working.\n- Window in room wouldn't close.l despite -10 temps.\n- Requested a coffee maker day one which never came.\n- Items from the bin were left in the bathroom counter??!!?\n- Tried to order room service but couldn't get them to answer, ever.\n- Had great difficulty with charges made by the hotel which weren't authorised.\n- When checking out was just asked 'you want a receipt' that was it.\n- When I advised the doormen I didn't need a taxi they stood inside and offered no assistance. With two big suitcases and heavy front doors another guest offered to help astonished that the hotel staff wouldn't.\n- Whilst checking out the two front desk staff were being rude and derogatory about other staff in front of me. Swapping at times to Spanish to say parts.\nI've stayed at a number of NYC hotels. All have good and bad points. But I will never recommend this hotel to anyone as it's atrocious behaviour toward guests is disgusting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:22:07.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
