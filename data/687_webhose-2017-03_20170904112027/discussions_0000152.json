We were handed a key for a shoe box-- 915. First The phone from the room did not even work. The reservation in my hand said RENOVATED ROOM. The bed skirt was ripped and the shade was torn. I called the hotel from my phone and finally located Carlos, who had checked us into our room, who had mentioned they are closing.... tomorrow?? He tried to argue with me that the reservation in my hand did not actually mean what it literally said. Finally he sent a bellman with a key to 609, evidently a perennial broken room. No TV picture. No soap, actually No SOAP and housekeeping banged on the door at 8:45 am to see when we would check out The lights over the bed turned on and off five feet from our bed. And our room was surrounded by revelers who arrived to party after 1am. What a party they had... Housekeeping did not knock on their rooms at 8:45, in fact not at all while we were still there. This is not a Bargain price for a nice hotel. This hotel is sadly one to avoid at any price. We had stayed here for several nights years ago; it was a dark very mod place with a terrific location so close to the shows. That is why we returned. Other nice hotels had good specials through both Trip Advisors and their private sites, so I implore you to skip the Paramount. Something is terribly wrong here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:02:16.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
