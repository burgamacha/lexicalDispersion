I spent two nights there with my husband on 30th and 31st December 2016. We booked because of all the great reviews on Trip advisor. However, the towels were threadbare and stained, the tv remote didn't work and when we complained were told that the tv channels were not working. We later discovered that wasn't true when we switched on the tv manually. The service couldn't be bothered to come up and check what the issue was so they just said the tv channels were non functional!! The fan also didn't work and we had to complain multiple times before someone came up to fix it and the staff wasn't friendly. The shower alternated between cold to random bursts of scalding water. The bed was very comfortable and the food was really good but I would never stay there again. I am Ugandan and I just don't understand how this can be rated number 2, I felt my stay really wasn't worth the money. Many better places are available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:09:28.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
