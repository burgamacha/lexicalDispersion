We checked in for a day and flying out next morning, so we asked reception staff whether is there any airporter information we could find out. She had no smile on her face, her reply was very rude and unhelpful. In the morning, we asked concierge to get us a normal taxi to get to airport, he called for a hotel private car instead. He negotiated a price with us and the private car driver. The concierge asked for tips before we sat in the private car. When all baggage were loaded onto the private car, the driver said the agreed price was Quote: d to go to another airport and not the airport we are going. He demanded the price has to increased by USD15. Unprofessional concierge who gave misinformation and still ask for tips. Terrible I regret staying in this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:46:35.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
