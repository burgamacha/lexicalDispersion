First thoughts were great as you get to a newly renovated lobby thinking excellent for the price. After that everything else was dirty and horrible and the whole place constantly stunk. Walk into the tiny lift that stunk of cannabis with little all inside. Then you walk down the hallway with the mouldy walls and wallpaper peeling, again stinking. As we got into the room the radiator was leaking and making a screeching noise. There was mould on both the floor and ceiling, telly was antique and had no remote. The sink was out of place and could see all the moulding sealant round the bottom. The door frame wasn't even on properly on the cupboard. The place is an absolute mess if they spent the money they have on the lobby on the rest of the place the hotel wouldn't be so bad as it is close to lovely food places and the subway etc. Staff were great and extremely helpful also another positive was that the beds were extremely comfy but other than that there wasn't that much good to say. 100% would not go back unless renovated as the rooms look nothing like the pictures shown.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:38:22.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
