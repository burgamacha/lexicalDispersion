As a Lifetime Platinum SPG member arriving at 1:00 am, I was met by a front desk clerk who disappeared into the back room and offered no solution to the oversold status. There was no other hotel room available in all of SFO. So at 2 am without any resolution, problem solving, customer service, or even an apology or empathetic behavior demonstrated by the hotel staff, I was left to return to the airport as the only safe place to go. No sleep for 36 hours. No shower. Unable to attend to a scheduled interview. Lost business and incurred the cost of a new return plane ticket. Lodged complaint with SPG without any response. Lodged complaint with parent company Marriott with a lame email stating that I should wait an additional 5 days to hear from the hotel management. It has been more than nine days without further response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:36:28.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
