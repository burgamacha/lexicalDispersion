Everything else is cold. The staff are so rude and to be honest the only time the lady at reception smiled was when we left. The room was big but the bed was rock hard. Bathroom was good and clean.

If you take the bus it stops on a dual carriage way and you have to walk on the hard shoulder up a slip road to get back to the hotel.\nI will not be going back.\nRoom Tip: A double bed is 2 singles joint together and I fell in between a few times.
