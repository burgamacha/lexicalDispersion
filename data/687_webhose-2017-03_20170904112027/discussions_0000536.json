Be aware of how COLUMBUS 6 may charge you twice for your stay. On November 2016, COLUMBUS 6 charged my credit card twice for the same stay and told my credit card company that this was my fault. I was charged twice for the same stay and lost nearly $2000, 00. Here is how: In two sequential charges on the same day in November 2016, my credit card was charged twice. After I saw the wrong charge, I immediately called COLUMBUS 6 and alerted them. My stay at COLUMBUS 6 did not happen until December 2016. An entire month went by before the charges appeared in my statement and my stay at COLUMBUS 6. After I saw the wrong charge, I immediately called and alerted the hotel, long before I actually stayed at COLUMBUS 6 in December 2016. In December 2016, when I stayed at COLUMBUS 6, I reminded them about their mistake and asked them to correct it. They went ahead and charged me double. COLUMBUS 6 cheated me. I do not recommend COLUMBUS 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:00:40.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
