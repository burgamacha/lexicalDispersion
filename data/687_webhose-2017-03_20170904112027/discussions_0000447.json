I gave 450 € in cash (400 € for the room and 50 € as tips).\nWhen I arrived in the room, the room was dirty for a 5 star hotel (you might say it did not clean up after the previous guest's departure), but I had no choice.\nI checked in at 4am and left the room at 10.30am.\nWhen checking in, the receptionist gave me my invoice, I was amazed to find that the room was charged at only 150€. I claim the refund of 250€ but I was only paid the 50€ of the deposit. I met the hotel manager Mr Mathew, who asked me to complain at the police if I wanted to take my money back (it's a 5 star treatment). The manager knowing that I was leaving in two days, blackmailed me, instead of confronting me with his Night Manager !!!\nInstead of preserving the image of the Intercontinental Hotel, the manager wants to dirty it.\nOkay, I'll be back in a few weeks for my business, and I will follow the advice of the hotel manager by filing a complaint at the police against the hotel and its staff, to view the camera recordings, and to claim damages and interest from the hotel, then I will send this complaint to the company IHG to transfer these persons corrupt.\nAkhtyna Erik", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:48:21.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
