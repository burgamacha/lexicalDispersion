While we were disappointed (imagine hearing that after lugging the luggage for 15 mins on the snowy/icy roads), we can understand the rationale and did NOT dispute.\nWhat we didn't understand or appreciate was the lady raising her voice the whole time. It was humilating as there were other guests at the lobby then. We left the hotel and went back because I thought I had left my gloves there (it was under 0Â°c) but guess what was the response from the same lady who yelled? \"No, it can't be here.\" That's very helpful.\nNeedless to say, I cancelled my booking because I'm on a holiday and simply don't deserve such a treatment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:59:08.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
