But it isn't. Reading other people's comments on 'hidden fees' made me check and double check that my 6 night booking is all-inclusive. I read the fine print, compared prices in several websites to see that if they match and that are now big differences, and had re-affirmed it all with a staff member while checking in.\nThis did not change a thing. As I was checking out, I noticed a 25% surcharge was added to the bill. Hotel staff denied our conversation from the check in process, blamed Expedia for misleading me and did not acknowledge that this is an issue, even though they admitted to making this same conversation several times per day, everyday.\nThere were other issues, too (long check-in process, getting an unsuitable room and an annoying delay in finding a different one), but the disappointment in paying 25% above the agreed rate makes everything else seem not important.\nStay here if your budget is flexible or if you get your kick from arguing with hotel staff over money at 4am, prior to your departure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:55:20.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
