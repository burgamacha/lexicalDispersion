After showing me the hotel online, we were extremely excited. When we entered our room our first thought was that the online pictures (specifically the rooms) were *extremely* deceiving. Our room was MUCH smaller than we expected (you could practically touch all the walls from the bed) and was not nearly as fresh or stylish as it appeared online. Our toilet leaked and had to be fixed. The desk and radiator were dirty and would have benefited greatly from a wipe down. Our room was HOT and despite us turning on the AC (which will not go below 65 or it will freeze the unit) it remained a balmy 76 (sometimes 77) degrees for our entire stay. There wasn't a mini bar or even a single bottled water in our room. Twice our phone rang - once very late at night and once very early with no one on the other line. A girlfriend attempted to send champagne to our room and was unable to make contact with anyone to accommodate her request. Will not be returning to Paramount Hotel Times Square.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:02:29.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
