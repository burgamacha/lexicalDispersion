The rooms are small, but there are different levels of smallness. I started in a tiny room and was moved to a bigger room. All rooms have paper thin walls, though my first room was louder than the second. Also nothing worked properly in my first room - lights, door lock...\nThe service is not great. They moved me to a new room because they had to renovate my first room, but did not explain that to me the night before. Since it was a business trip and I had a morning meeting, it was a real hassle.\nIf you get a good deal, this place will be fine, but I would not stay here by choice.\nRoom Tip: if your room seems small, ask for a bigger room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:30:36.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
