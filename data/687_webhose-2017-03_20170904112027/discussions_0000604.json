Always guaranteed a friendly welcome and excellent service. Sadly, not in this instance. We checked in late after a 3 hour drive from Wales to be met by a surly, bordering on rude receptionist. After loitering for what seemed like an age, he finally found our booking.\nWe booked the family suite and can't complain with the standard of the room. Very spacious, comfortable and very private which was good as we were travelling with our teenager.\nNext morning for breakfast we were met by yet another rude member of staff who showed us to a table without a word or without the offer of tea or coffee. Had to hunt someone down to get some.\nThe receptionist who checked us out on the Sunday was very apologetic and friendly. A lot like what we're used to.\nIt hasn't put us off Hilton as generally it's a good brand and you (should) know what you're getting but this has tainted our continued patronage. A little refreshment in customer service wouldn't go amiss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:36:47.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
