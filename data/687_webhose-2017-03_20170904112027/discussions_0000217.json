I was SO disappointed with the recent renovations! The new furniture is Ikea quality at best and the new lighting is a migraine sufferer's worst nightmare! The glare from the globes on either side of the bed was so bad I had to ask Housekeeping to send up a lamp from a room not yet renovated. They did but we still had to place a pillowcase over the other light to make it bearable. What a shame to select form over function.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a non-renovated room. Much nicer.
