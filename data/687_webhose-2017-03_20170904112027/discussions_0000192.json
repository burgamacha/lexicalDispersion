I tried to turn the AC on and a really bad smell filled the room, and it didn't even cooled the room, had to keep a window open which was an annoyance due to the sign just outside, street noise and didn't feel safe. Commodities are non-existent and very uncomfortable bed and pillows. Wouldn't stay here again. The only silver lining is that is close to the Eiffel Tower and attractions. They should strip at least 1 star from this hotel!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room in the upper rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:36:06.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
