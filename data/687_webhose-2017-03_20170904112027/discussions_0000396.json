She went around the clients in her plastic protection asking the guests whats for roomnumber. Maybe the other woman didnt speak at all, she didnt say even \"goodmorning\". The breakfast wasnt good. the coffemashines both wanted to bee cleaned at the display, the egg omelett was empty ( at 8.15 ) the water bottle was an evian, but was refilled with tapwater.\nOpon all this, we had to pay another 15 € per person for the breakfast when we checked out. Even if i asked by check-in if all was payed for! And asking about breakfast! I speak good french, and the portier said she just needed the credit card for \"security\"... Why dont say the truth?. The room was ok, cobwebs in the ceiling and corners, and teve with 30 french speaking sender, 2 english and one german... / other french hotels have at least the zdf news from germany and some bbc world channels..\nWaterpressure not so good, ok for a shower, but toilet doesnt get clean.\nWifi had to be reconnected every time you came in to the hotel again. Dont place your doorcard to close to the mobile, gets unuseful...\nif you are just searching for a nights sleepning, dont mind looking on french tv, and have a working wifi on your phone. And dont mind paying 15 € extra for breakfast without eggs and coffe, ok!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:24:15.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
