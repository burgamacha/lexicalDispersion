We have ordered sandwiches. When the waiter brought them, they looked like somebody took a pound of sliced ham from the pack (did not even care to separate the slices) and just smashed it between two pieces of bread. I think they understood how bad it looked because they tried to camouflage it with chips.\nWe were watching GGG fight in the room, and asked for whisky. For some reason the room service refused to bring it to our room. Instead they confirmed that I should go down to the lobby bar, and buy it there. The barman refused to sell the bottle, because a manager (I think her name is Steffani) did not know how to count how many portions are in one bottle. After long negotiations, he gave me two full glasses of whisky, which I had to carry into the room. For that he charged me $200.\nSo, if you plan a trip, think about another option for your stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:39:47.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
