In addition, the walls between rooms were incredibly thin and I had to listen to next door's TV and various bathroom noises....\nThe bed was ok but the curtain did not shut properly so light was streaming in from early on.\nGreat location for Euston. Super friendly staff but the lack of a good quality night of sleep means I would never return to this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:29:23.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
