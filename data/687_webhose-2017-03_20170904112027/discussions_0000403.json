We were in room 130 and there was the sound like water filling up a tank that went on for ages in the dead of night, then stopped, then started again. Kept us awake for ages.\n2. There was also noise outside at night but we were in Soho and stayed on a Saturday so to some extent a bit of late night drunken street noise was to be expected.\n3. We were in a small double and the bed is rammed against one wall which, for two people, makes the bed feel a bit constrained. As a single, it would be fine. To be fair, the hotel do warn you about this somewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:57:50.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
