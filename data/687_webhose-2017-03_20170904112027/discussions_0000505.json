The king room I booked was quite large but needed a new carpet and the toilet roll holder in the bathroom kept falling off. When I booked online I was asked if I wanted a quiet room ( does anyone ask for noisy rooms?). On arrival I was given a fairly noisy room overlooking third avenue on the 17th floor. You could hear the outside traffic a bit too loud for comfort. The receptionist chuckled when I asked for the quiet room informing me that the area itself was noisy and that nothing was available on higher floors. Obviously, the management is not interested in installing good quality noise -abating windows.\nThere is no lobby at the entrance, only a small check- in counter, usually managed by only one person. No room service either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:37:52.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
