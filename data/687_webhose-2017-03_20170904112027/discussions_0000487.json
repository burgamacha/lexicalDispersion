It was either the smell of cigarette smoke or marijuana, mostly marijuana so bad it knocked you down once the elevator opened up. The rooms were extremely outdated and left in the 90s. Bathroom was dirty and molded. I wish I could say the service was great but sadly that isn't the case either. When asked what could be done about the smell the first time they just brought a can of air freshener. The second time, hotel security came up to our floor and said it was because a window was open that there's no way there are actually people smoking marijuana in the hotel, pushed my concern to the side and left. Also asked for new towels and wash cloths because they didn't bring any during maintenance. Instead of providing enough for the whole room they brought one single towel and one single hand towel. 100% would NEVER stay here again. It's only saving grace was that it was close to several good cafe's and Central Park as well as comfortable beds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:38:21.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
