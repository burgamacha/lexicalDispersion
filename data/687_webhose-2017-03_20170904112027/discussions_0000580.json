I know mistakes can happen but to have to fight with the front desk for a room once you just arrived, suitcases and all and wait for and 1 hour and half just to get a stop complaining room the other 5 times I've stayed I had really good experiences but this last time it's really making me reconsider if I will ever stay here again nor will I recommend it", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:49:23.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
