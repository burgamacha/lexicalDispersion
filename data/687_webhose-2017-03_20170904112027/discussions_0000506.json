The location is excellently placed. It is within walking distance of Waterloo Station and a River Thames.\nThe room is compact, but it is arranged to function well.\n**I only warn of my bad experience as a primer. The Westminster location is under construction as on March 2017. During our stay our room was located right next to where the work was being done. We leave in a urban environment back at home, but the close proximity was just too much. I was not able to enjoy my stay.\nTo further the terrible experience the front staff was not helpful in resolving the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:12:50.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
