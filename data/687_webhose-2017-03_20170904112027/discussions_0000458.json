The room was tiny, our shower didn't work and you had to wait a very long time just to use the lifts! But worst of all was the attitude of staff on the front desk. One man in particular was so rude and unhelpful - the worst customer service I'd ever experienced. We had been locked out of our own room while we were out and - after being there for two days already - the man accused us of lying about it being our room because the key cards didn't work. Our passports and money were all in the safe of the room we could now not get access to. He sent us up to the 14th floor three times after claiming to have fixed the key cards (he hadn't) only to tell us it wasn't his problem when we came back down. He also attempted to charge my partner $10 to print off a voucher on a previous day when the printer in the business centre didn't work (it cost $0.25 to do it in the business centre). If it wasn't for the super apologetic manager we'd have left immediately. She told us the member of staff in question was new and needed more training - I'm not sure you can train someone out of a bad attitude.\nOn a more positive note the location of the hotel was quite good in terms of the subway and main tourist areas - but we definitely would not go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:58:50.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
