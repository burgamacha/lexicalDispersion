However, everything else about my one night there was very average or worse. I am amazed this counts as a 'luxury' 5* hotel. My trip started by going to the wrong hotel: my fault but there are multiple Radisson Blu Edwardian X hotels in central London but the names only vary when you get to the fourth word and tenth syllable of the name which doesn't help at all. Perhaps as a result Google maps had two locations for this hotel. I'd already checked in online, which took quite a while (which then resulted in me being pestered by text message by an AI assistant) I was thus expecting to be able to collect my keys immediately but no - the checkin process still took a few minutes and required me to sign something saying among other things that the hotel wasn't liable even if I put valuable in the room safe I think (why couldn't this be part of the online checkin process). At checkout the credit card details I'd registered online didn't work so I had to provide again. i.e. online checkin was a waste of time (I could select a room online but with no information about how the rooms vary this wasn't very useful.) After getting into the room I called reception to get the wifi password - they told me one but after several attempts it was clearly wrong. I then called again and was told by someone else that the password could only be found by navigating through the television menu under 'hotel information'. The wifi information under 'hotel information' was also wrong (and extremely out of date saying for example that I needed Windows 2000 to use the internet...) I eventually found it straight off the home screen of the television and it worked. The original wrong password I was given was also in the printed information in the room: i.e. three different instructions for wifi with only one that worked. I switched the 'do not disturb' light on and tried to get some rest, only to be woken by a staff member knocking on my door about an hour after my call saying he'd been instructed to check my wifi. I told him I hadn't requested this and asked why he had ignored the do not disturb sign and he said he was following instructions. The bathtub had a large rust spot on the bottom. The hallways outside my room smelt of cigarette smoke. The breakfast was incredibly basic even for a lower class of hotel with a tiny buffet (they charged me after telling me after I started the breakfast that it wasn't included). The minibar in the room was one of those annoying automatic ones with a big sign on the door saying that I'd be automatically charged even if the contents were touched rather than consumed. The staff were generally very friendly though most spoke poor English - one even responded to me in Spanish when I spoke to her in English. I've stayed in many five star hotels and many other hotels - this was definitely at the basic, non luxury end of the scale based on my experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:17:22.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
