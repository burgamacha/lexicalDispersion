Staff are very nice and helpful. The room is sad and pathetic for a Marriott. I stayed at the Marriott in Pleasanton 2 weeks ago, was automatically upgraded and granted concierge access. When asked about this in San Mateo I was sadly denied. I requested a room away from noise/ elevators which I received. The bed is sagging, the furniture is old, worn (stained), chipped, torn and blankets were filthy. The mini fridge was also HOT not even cool. Not sure how that's possible. The staff did replace the fridge and provided a nice, clean and warmed blanket upon request. I'm staying here for business but would not recommend actually having to pay for such accommodations.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:11:07.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
