Room we had was very dark, one window had a view of the fire escape, the other an ally. The toilet overflowed, flooding the whole bathroom requiring maintenance to be called. The queen bed was comfortable enough but the sofa bed was horrible, it was old and needed to be replaced. The lobby and personnel however were lovely. The location was also great.
