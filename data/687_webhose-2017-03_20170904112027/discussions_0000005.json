When I left the hotel before my mom on Monday morning, I realized that I left a pair of expensive sunglasses in the room. Since my mom was still at the hotel, I asked her to leave them with the front desk for me to pick up later in the week because I live in the city and I didn't want her to bring them back to FL with her. Therefore, My mom gave the sunglasses to the front desk with a note of them.\nLong story short: I tried to pick up them up on Friday (4 days later). After making me wait for 45 minutes while the employees looked for them, They informed me that they couldn't locate my sunglasses. I was livid because the employees didn't seem to care.\nOn Monday morning, I spoke to both the assistant GM and the GM, and both of them were EXTREMELY RUDE - They blamed me for leaving my sunglasses and said that I should have picked them up sooner.\nThey said that they weren't responsible for \"lost or stolen items.\" However, my sunglasses weren't lost or stolen until my mom gave them to the front desk for \"safe keeping.\"\nWord to the wise: Don't stay here! This hotel will steal/loose your items, berate you as if it was your fault, and rudely refuse to fully compensate you when they mess up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:17:51.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
