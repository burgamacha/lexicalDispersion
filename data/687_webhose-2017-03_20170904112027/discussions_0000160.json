The room which was allotted to us had faulty air conditioning system. We had to get it changed in the middle of the night. The bathrooms are too small and have a strange setting. The breakfast served is patehetic and has no vegetarian offerings. Every hotel in the world does serve their guests with their specific needs but this hotel and its staff do not care. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone if visiting Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:44:04.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
