Come to this hotel only to get a brunch at the lounge, but be prepared for the bad service even there. The good looking servers do not care about you or your order (you can wait forever and you can get the wrong order, and the servers will not even apologize). The food is good but expensive. The rooms are awful: very tiny, with a retro style which need a serious refit, dirty. They do not provide you any slipper and you will not want to put your feet on the dark brown carpet which is stained and ages old. The wifi of the hotel is not stable, no matter if you purchase the premium connection which in theory support VPN. Do not come to the hotel if ever you have to work. They do not provide a cable for the land connection as an alternative solution even after request (this option does not exist). The phone of my room was not working. I had to call for a room service with my HK phone.\nEven at the front desk they do not have any idea of what service is like: after my check out I've asked the front desk person to store my luggages for the day and the answer was \"you will need to take them to the ground floor yourself and ask for the door man\". Seriously You can find much better hotel option around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:09:10.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
