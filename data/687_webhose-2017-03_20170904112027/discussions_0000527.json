I can honestly say this is the worst hotel i have every stayed at. The rooms were extremely small - no room for anything, couldn't hang clothes up, no space for suitcase, no storage in the bathrooms, the 'double bed' was only big enough for one person (two pillows didnt even sit side by side on the bed as there wasn't enough room) We were miss sold our room and feel like this whole thing was a con. I cannot even express how tiny the room is - we only wish we had listened to the reviews and stayed somewhere else. I will be reporting this to the management/holding company.\nI cannot put into words how angry i am about this - i have emailed the hotel and had no reply - shock!\nRoom Tip: Avoid if you dont want to ruin your holiday See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:05:23.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
