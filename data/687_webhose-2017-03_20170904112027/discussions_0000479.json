The place is in a great location, and was probably nice 10 years ago. It is run down, badly in need of upgrades and a good cleaning. We had ants, and on the 2 night they spread all over the room. We told them and they were fumigated but we had dead ants all over the floor which never got cleaned up. The elevator broke, wasn't repaired for 2 days, and after the repair was complete we got stuck in it - not even an apology.\nBreakfast sucked, even for Italian standards.
