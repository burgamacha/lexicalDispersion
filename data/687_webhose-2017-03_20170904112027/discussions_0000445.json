(Not fun after being on a plane for 12+ hours to get here) Room is hotter than Hades. Advised front desk clerk who takes me to the room to show me how to work it, only to discover that like I said, the controls are showing an error code. He advises to wait and it should cool off. I wait an hour more and it's still hot. He suggests that all other rooms will be hot too because they only have heat on right now. Won't change my room. I prepaid $150 a night for 3 days and am considering giving up and going to another hotel if I can find one.
