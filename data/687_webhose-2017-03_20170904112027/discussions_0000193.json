Room 502 was given to us, and as soon as we entered the hallway prior to going in, we noticed stains on the walls and the carpet. Upon entering the room, the olive drab colored carpet in the bedroom was covered with a myriad of stains ranging from what looked like oil to bodily fluid. No part of the room looked anything like the nice pictures that were online. 2 hours after our check in, our room cards were inactive and couldn't open the door. One of the tables in the room was broken upon arrival, and none of the furniture is sturdy. The clerk at the front desk was originally hesitant towards giving us the room, and kept coming up with reasons as to why we couldn't stay there. The run down room was very disappointing to stay in, especially because we booked a superior 1 bedroom suite and in return had no choice but to stay in a haunting and outdated room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:59:19.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
