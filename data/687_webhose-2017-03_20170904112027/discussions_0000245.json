When I arrived I was given a room to the front, the lights in the room didn't work properly and the shower was partially broken. True to the reviews the noise at the front was awful even though tearooms are double glazed. I was awake until 1;30 hearing dogs and screaming up to the time I fell asleep.\nI did complain and was told that \"this is Paris\" and I did point out I come to Paris 4/5 times a year and had never had such a bad experience. I was allocated a room to the rear and there was no further noise problems.\nBreakfast was included, which was good, but it is in the basement and pretty basic tables. But then again you don't stay there long.\nI have stayed in a number of Timhotels in Paris but this is probably the worst so far. Wish I had booked the Holiday Inn or Hotel 12 nearby.\nRoom Tip: If you book a room at the back, make sure you get one otherwise you may have a sleepless night.
