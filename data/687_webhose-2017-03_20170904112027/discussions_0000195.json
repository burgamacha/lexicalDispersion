The room was so small, there was no room for suitcases. The room safes could be lifted out of the cupboard it was in. The bathroom was separated from the bedroom by clear glass, so your partner can watch you in the toilet!!. Whilst your knees are touching the wall while sitting on the toilet.Dark wood walls that made it look worse, (not that anything could have made it look better). The lobby area is dark, and the \" Restaurant.\" probably just makes the description of restaurant is dark with very little choice.\nThe corridor decor and room doors, made the hotel look like a cross between a psychiatric hospital and toytown.\nApparently a 4star, I would say lucky to scrape 2 star. Funny thing I stayed at Central Park Hotel 2 years ago which was very good, The Hudson was more expensive and had more stars. Do not know why. If I could have got a refund, I would have walked straight out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:02:51.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
