Unfortunately, after the check in, we were not even taken to our rooms by a member of the staff, which is impressing given the Hotel level. I must admit that I asked to take care of my luggage personally. Nevertheless someone should show you the room and make sure that there are no problems. I think this is the minimum standard in any 3+ stars hotel. The room service was average. Indeed, the room was clean but you expect something more than cleanliness at Sofitel. You expect something like: some attention on how the bad is prepared, maybe a few chocolates on the pillows, etc. The room was big enough but due to the space being poorly organised it looked much smaller. The concierge was really polite and helpful, similarly to the receptionists. The doorman was really professional, probably the best member of the stands we met. Would I reccomend this hotel to a friend given the price/quality and overall experience? I don't think so. Next time I will be looking for a better alternative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:04:13.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
