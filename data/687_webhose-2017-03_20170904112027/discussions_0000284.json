I have to say that I seem to be more disappointed each time. The second stay saw a room with cracked window panes, and a shabby divan bed with no valence or cover on the base. Whilst clean and tidy, the bed is uncomfortable and noisy with a cheap mattress.\nMy stay earlier in the month was for two nights, and on the second day, my coffee supplies weren't replenished , nor was the empty tissue box replaced. I was also lest with dirty towels, despite not having left them on the towel rack.\nWifi is good, and that there are tea and coffee facilities is a plus. Breakfast, for what you pay is disappointing, and the same every day - no variety, nor would it be suitable for different faiths as the cold buffet meats are pork based.\nSo in summary: shabby; could be better maintained; room supplies need to be replaced after use; more variety with breakfast; good wifi; clean and tidy; and friendly and helpful staff. It is reasonably priced for London, so I guess you get what you pay for.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:14:34.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
