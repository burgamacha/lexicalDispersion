First let me start your manager B.J Patel. Long story short, he threatened to kick me out of his hotel stating I was just trying to get a room comped. I came to my room after our business meeting and three guys are standing in my room changing locks with ZERO prior notice! All of my money and personal items were exposed! I was livid and called BJ and he said he was sorry but has the right to enter my room at any time they feel like it! They leave so I go to take a bath and a worker uses the key and OPENS the door as I had no clothes on and I jumped into the bathroom. I call BJ and demand a refund he tells me I need to leave the premises because he asked his worker and he said this did not happen. I immediately asked to speak with the gentlemen and he then ADMITTED he knocked on the door twice, no answer and walked in and YES I was not dressed! Then BJ says, oh, ok, I will comp your room. I took pictures of them in my room without my consent and I will be posting this on all social media sites as not only intrusive but to be called a liar and told I need to leave is UNACCEPTABLE! â€‹", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:08:20.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
