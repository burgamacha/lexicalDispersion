From the check in to the rude staff, to the tiny spaces they call rooms. We landed at 9pm at night for a three day stay at Fairfield. The staff at reception took their sweet time checking us in. We were a party of two adults and two kids (3, 5). Our room barely had space for one, let alone 4. With two double beds, there was HARDLY any space to walk. When we called for reception and asked for a bigger room, which we were willing to pay for, they very rudely refused. The room next to ours (which we later found out was vacant and bigger, was not given to us). The room was clean but it was NOT COMFORTABLE. too claustrophobic. The free breakfast included in the package was another ordeal. It ends at 9:30 which is a ridiculous time for weekends. Atleast keep it till 11. Furthermore, the breakfast is cold.\nHORRIBLE experience ever. I suggest add a little extra to your budget and stay at the Holiday Inn on 57th and 10th. its ALOT bigger and more accommodating.\nwe got ripped off on off-site parking as well, when there was FREE parking at the front of the hotel that they refused to tell us about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:46:21.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
