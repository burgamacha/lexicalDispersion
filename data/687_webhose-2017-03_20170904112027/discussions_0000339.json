My colleague booked two nights as he wanted to check in very early from an overnight flight, I arrived late in the evening checking in just before midnight, the hotel had been warned I'd arrive late.\nThe hotel is well located but absolutely tiny, almost Lilliputian. Check in desk/lobby is about the size of a counter at a dry cleaners. The lift barely carries one person and suitcase. I had room 602, on top floor, and the sloping roof meant I could only stand up on one side of the room. The bed filled the room. The wardrobe was a cupboard I original thought contained an electricity meter - on opening it I discovered some hangers, but the whole unit was half the height of the wall. My jacket would have draped on the floor had I used it.\nI'm six foot one, and could probably have stretched out in bed and touched both walls. The shower was too short for me, by about four inches, and I had to duck to get under it.\nThe room smelt as if it was a smoking room, and my colleague reported his room on the third floor was taller, but no bigger, and not clean.\nWe checked out and didn't take breakfast, as the breakfast room was too small for us to chat and work in. In total these three nights cost us over â‚¬500. We'll be recommending to our client that they don't book this hotel again.\nScoring for location only - avoid otherwise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:55:33.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
