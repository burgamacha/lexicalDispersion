Good location, breakfast includes in price, and low price. As the saying goes: «Beware of Greeks bearing gifts»…Before the trip, four days before the trip the hotel withdrew THREE sums of money from the bank account. Having arrived to the hotel we discovered that the girl on reception couldn’t find two our reservations, and they could give us only one room. We should have crossed ourselves and left there, but unfortunately we didn’t it. And then miracles began… The hotel withdrew absolutely different sums of money for rooms from two cards, then one more time hotel withdrew money from one of the cards. When we went down to clear the situation the girl on reception suggested in a raised voice to move away from reception because of next client. As a result the sum exceeded the expected price for two rooms by 450$. In two days the hotel again began to try to withdraw money. At first, there were two attempts to withdraw 130$, then for the third time – 148$. And in several days after received check out the hotel withdrew two full amounts for stay!!! During the booking rooms on booking.com the hotel doesn’t inform about additional payments, this information is concealed. People who are going to this hotel – you will lose your money! And several words about the hotel: cold rooms, air-conditioner hasn’t been cleaned for a long time, it works for heating, but it’s prohibited to turn it on for a night, and it’s very noisy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:57:13.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
