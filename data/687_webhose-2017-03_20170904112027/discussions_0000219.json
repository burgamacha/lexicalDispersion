And this time it hasn't been the best experience as it was the first time we stayed...\nAt check in I was told that my kids needed to have an ID or birth certificate to show their age... Both are teens an 8th grader and a senior in high school ( 14 and 17). I asked if this was a new policy ( as this is our 2nd visit to the hotel) and the lady at the front desk stated it was and it began on March 1st of this year; today is only the 4th and it was not on the website when I booked the hotel.\nWell we checked in and went out for a while and came back to our room and it now smells like cigarette smoke.... I called the front desk and the lady informed me that I was on a no smoking room floor and it must be coming from outside... I then asked if someone could come and check our room because my son has asthma... She cut me off in the middle of my sentence and said that someone would be up here immediately .... It has been over 30 minutes and no one has yet came to check the room... We have a couple of more days here but I'm not sure we will be returning to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:56:50.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
