They apologized saying the hotel was old and the AC couldn't be turned on. They brought me a fan even with the windows open and it being 55 degrees out the room wouldn't get below 77. Then we got hit with an extra $40 in fees per night because of my daughter (even though I put 3 people when I reserved room), and some facility fee of 20 per night. Those fees made the \"deal\" we got not a good deal at all.
