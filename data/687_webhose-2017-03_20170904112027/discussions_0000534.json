That's about it.\nPoor quality of sleep. Very noisy from the outside and especially from within the hotel. The walls are so thin we could hear neighbours from both sides and from above.\nThe WiFi was appalling. Hardly worked at all.\nElectrical sockets were only working when bed side lights were on (you either sleep or charge your phone in full light, can't do both).\nRoom was tired with quick-fix patches of different type of wall papers. It was so small i could not fit even third of it into one picture. The bed cover was so old and overused it had holes in it.\nEven for a 2 star property it's kind of bad.\nOverall, it did the job but I would not stay again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:39:33.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
