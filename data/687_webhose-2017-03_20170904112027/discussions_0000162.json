My taxi driver had so much trouble finding it that he gave me a rebate on the taxi fare. However, the location is a short walk to several stations and a good shopping district and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby.\nMy room was cramped and very dingy, the lighting is completely insufficient and I resorted to hanging my clothes on the door hinge as there was so little room anywhere else. The bathroom is so tiny that there isn't even room to put down a wash bag, although the bathroom did look as if it had seen some modernisation. My room was more like an oversized cupboard. I had to keep stepping over my suitcase since there was no room to get in or out once it was open. The decoration is all in a rather dated dirty pink colour with burgundy striped curtains. The slightest noise in the hallway can be heard in the rooms and the staff seem to be permanently hoovering for some reason.\nThe hotel itself is dilapidated and in dire need of refurbishment which it seems to be getting so expect builders and a certain amount of mess. The lift seems to take 10 minutes to arrive every time (the one that's working) so I resorted to the emergency stairs which are even more grungy than the rest of the hotel. The staff always look slightly surprised to see you when you emerge from the stairwell.\nThe restaurant is accessed through a tent which leaks in the rain making access a tricky maneuver around the puddles. The food was average at best, rubbery mushrooms, greasy bacon so I'd suggest trying your luck at the cafes across the road.\nOverall there are far better places to stay at the price and I won't be rushing back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:44:23.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
