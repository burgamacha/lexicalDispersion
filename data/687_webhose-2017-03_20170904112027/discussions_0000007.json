This hotel is wonderful - incredibly great staff - just like other Four Seasons I have stayed at. But the accessible rooms are a disaster. The problem is the bathroom floor. The floor is not sloped towards the drain, so shower water floods the entire bathroom and even gets to the edge of the room's carpeted floor. Water pools around the toilet and elsewhere, making it slippery to make your way around after a shower. Exactly what you don't need in an accessible bathroom. The hotel is aware of the problem. It appears that their renovation contractor botched the floors in all their accessible rooms. They tried to patch the issue by adding a lip at the shower entrance, but that was useless in our room. The best we could do was to arrange 4-5 towels like sand bags around the shower. Until they pull up the bathroom floors and grind them down to drain properly, I will not return to this property if I need an accessible room again.\nOther than this issue with the room, the hotel was great. Staff is phenomenal. Location is great. Would not hesitate to stay here if I needed a normal room.\nRoom Tip: Accessible rooms are terrible.
