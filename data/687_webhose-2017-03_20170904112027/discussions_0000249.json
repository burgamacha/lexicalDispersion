I travelled with a group of 26 colleagues and 4 rooms were held with my visa debit card but unfortunately it is 12 days since our stay and the hotel is still holding over â‚¬1000 charge on my card despite the fact that all rooms have been paid for. I have emailed the hotel twice and called them twice and both times they assured me that the matter would be sorted urgently but still the charge is held on my Visa debit card. This is totally unacceptable and very frustrating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:29:01.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
