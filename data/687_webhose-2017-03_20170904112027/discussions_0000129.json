The hotel is not located near any major attractions and therefore requires a cab or metro ride to go anywhere. There was no working phone in our room and bed pillows were wafer thin. No hand towels in bathroom and only 1 tiny bar of soap provided each day- no other amenities at all. You are also required to leave your room key at the front desk every time you leave the hotel which is like offering all of your possessions to the hotel staff! Also wifi is provided free of charge, but does not work. We were not able to download even an email!\nRoom Tip: There are no good rooms- do not book this hotel!
