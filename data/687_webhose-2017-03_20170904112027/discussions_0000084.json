We had to keep asking the desk for towels. The worst thing was the bathtub. I have knee trouble, although I could get into it with help there were no treads at the bottom nor was there a grab bar. This situation was quite dangerous. Unlike other hotels we stayed at, there was no emergency pull in the tub. We asked for a room with a shower only but either none was available or they didn't exist. The entry which was up several steps had no handrail plus an automatic door which kept opening if you didn't move fast enough. The breakfast room was pretty. The front desk people were pleasant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:58:12.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
