Not a very welcoming hall. It was a sign of things to come.\nMy first room had cables dangling out a cupboard and was on the second floor above the road. There was apparently only alternative left when I checked in. Another room on the second floor overlooking the street, but no dangling cables. Hurray.\nThis was a superior room. Who would have thought. The noise from the street with the window closed was very bad. I heard every cart, motorbike and coach going by. Not to mention the sirens. Sleep was hard to come by.\nChanged rooms again, this time *downgraded* to a Club room. It's slightly quieter, but the huge A/C unit on the low roof next door does not help.\nThe entire place is run down. Just check out the picture of the chair in my room with its stained and ripped cover. It says it all.\nOnly good thing: staff is not bad and the bed surprisingly comfortable\nRoom Tip: Away from the street if you want to sleep See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:33:38.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
