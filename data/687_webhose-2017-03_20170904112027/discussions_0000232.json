Our first room was dark, smelly and was too hot as the air conditioning did not work. Therefore the hotel put us in a bigger room where the air conditioning appeared to work but didn't. We booked a day tour recommended by the hotel's tour desk. This was the worst tour we have experienced anywhere in the world. When we complained the hotel only offered a discount on future bookings. We would not ever book through this person ever again. There is the smell of sewage in the hall but we have to leave the room door open to get the air conditioning from the hallway. The restaurant dinner was also dreadful. The breakfast buffet experience was like eating at a food court. We would like to move to a different hotel but we prepaid at this hotel. The standard of this Accor hotel is well below the standard of other Accor properties around the world I have visited. Also, the WiFi doesn't work on Android phones which is a notable inconvenience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:53:18.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
