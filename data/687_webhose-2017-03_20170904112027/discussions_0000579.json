Trying to put my makeup on while my husband showers and I'm standing in his shower water the whole time! It even ran all the way into the hallway! Maintenance comes right up and offers towels. Thanks but I'm not cleaning the bathroom on my vacation! The gentlemen tells us no worries he will have the problem cleaned up and fixed by the time we get back. Leave hotel at 5pm back 2am and bathroom still full of water. Had to keep boots on to brush my teeth and wash my face!\nWhen leaving I ask the bell hop to call us a cab. He says I'm dealing with the alarm go stand outside with your arm up! It's 25 degrees out and I just wanted a cab so we would make our reservations on time. Ended up walking!\nCrazy experience! I don't recommend as I don't feel a Hilton should be this low budget!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:31:25.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
