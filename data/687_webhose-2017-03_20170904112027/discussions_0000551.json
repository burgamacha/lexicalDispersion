Cables having out, bathroom light fixture in mirror didn't work, silicone allover the mirror, long paint lines on the bathroom wall, glass door in shower area was wrongly fitted and is only waiting to crack.\nAlthough that we were 2 in a executive King room, we only got 1 bath towel or none. We tried to leave not on the bed, but that only resulted in 2 small towels.. When we went to the front desk, the girl started argues with us, fist she said that in a king room they only expect one guest, when that didn't fly, she went on to that the maid could not read english and they would not under stand that a not on the bed would be for here.. (if you leave many on the bed, she would have taken them), the sad thing was that she never offered to bring us 2 bath towels. Who in customer service starts argue with the customer over lack of towels in the room?\nA normal approach would have been, a short apology, maybe a possible scenario of why it have gone wrong, but defiantly a solution on how to fix it.\nIt's sad that a hotel that have started out with a very nice idea with a very different decor is dropping the ball on finishing and the staff in the front desk.\nI did like the bar and the staff there was very nice.\nWould be carefull about recommending this hotel to friends and customers.\nMight come back for the bar, but not the rest.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:55:13.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
