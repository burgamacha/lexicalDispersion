I had been allocated a 1st floor room, but the lift was out of order. When I explained due to disability the I couldn't carry my case up the stairs, I was told I would have to wait until 10pm when the night staff arrived and a man would be able to carry may case upstairs.\nI left my case in reception and went to meet a colleague.\nI returned at 10pm, but the night staff refused to carry my case upstairs due to his bad back.\nThe receptionist then allocated me a ground floor room.\nAfter some confusion as to which ground floor room, I settled in the room.\nI checked the window to ensure it was secure. It wasn't and had signs of being previously forced open. As a single woman, I felt unsafe. I called reception, who arrived and was able to secure the window with force.\nThe shower door didn't close fully and the facilites were grubby.\nOn the second night nearby building work persisted throughout the night, which at times felt like they were actually demolishing the hotel!\nCoffee from the machine at breakfast was like dishwater, although the food buffet was good. The early morning receptionist was delightful.\nI was hoping to be a regular guest at this hotel, but sadly this experience has made this unlikely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:10:33.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
