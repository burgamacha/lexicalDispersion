This was no different.\nThe room was clean enough but very warm and the air con system wasn't working. The staff were friendly enough although most seemed to be training which dining help the speed of getting things done at a busy time.\nBreakfast was included but I would have paid not too eat it if I'm honest, really disappointing. It isn't that hard to serve up a half decent breakfast but I'm afraid they missed the mark completely.\nAs with all hotels in London you end up paying ridiculous prices so I can't say it was good value either.\nOverall a disappointing experience. In future I will be trying to find a Premier Inn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:49:13.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
