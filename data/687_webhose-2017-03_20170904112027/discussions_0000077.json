The room smelled unfresh and generally unclean (both upon arrival and the second day after it was \"cleaned\"). Towels are old and don't dry well anymore (why they've not been replaced I don't know). Luckily the window could be opened to let the air in a bit (when restaurants outside aren't running and when weather permits).\nTo stack on top of this, my partner and I both had serious respitory reactions inside the hotel (first time ever experiencing this traveling). While outside in Paris, as soon as we left the hotel, no issues. Imagine each morning waking up with a sore throat and uncomfortable eyes-not ideal.\nOur solace was that we could leave as soon as we were able to get dressed, and remedy our ailments.\nWhether this was mold (what it occasionally smelled like), dirt, or something else, I don't know - but the cleanliness alone would keep me from coming back (despite the very fine service otherwise).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:42:08.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
