The accommodations were fine. What dampened my experience with this hotel is how the hotel management handled my flight cancellation. I had reserved for six nights but ended up staying for five because my original flight to Paris was cancelled. I advised the hotel of my late arrival as soon as I was notified by the airline. Providing less than 48 hours notice, even though the circumstances were beyond my control, was not satisfactory for the hotel management. Even contacting Best Western Headquarters for their assistance was not helpful. Hence, I am out of pocket for this one missed night even though the BWP Trocadero still had time to offer this room to other guests. A goodwill gesture like a significant discount to the one night rate would have gone a long way to make my experience more pleasurable. I know now to avoid BWP.
