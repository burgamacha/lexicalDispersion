The hotel is contemporary and clean. My room is just what I need for a 1 night stay. Small but perfectly formed - or so I thought.\nI always wear earplugs when I work away from home to ensure I get a good sleep, however in my room there is a cupboard just a couple of feet away from the bed, in that cupboard is an internal down-pipe carrying foul or grey water. Regularly throughout the night there has been a loud gushing noise coming from the cupboard. It sounds like someone is flushing a very vigorous toilet next to your head.\nI've no idea if this is the same in other rooms. Please avoid room 101 if you don't want to feel like you're trying to sleep under a waterfall.\nA real shame, as my first impression was a good one. I would suggest this room is not fit for anyone to sleep in.\nAvoid room 101!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:19:18.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
