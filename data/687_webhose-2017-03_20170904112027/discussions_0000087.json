The hotel was exquisite, immaculate and wonderfully restored. I found the staff to be extremely nice, helpful and accommodating.\nThe only reason for 2 stars instead of 4 or 5 stars is the MATTRESS. We stayed in room that was brand new, recently opened. The mattress was the worst mattress I have ever slept on in my entire life. My wife and I would wake up each morning with a terrible backache. Just to give you some context, I am a 45 year old male with a VERY healthy back, never have I had a bad back in my life. I complained to the front desk but was informed the room was new and the mattresses were a signature item provided to all Thompson hotels. Result - I will never stay at a Thompson Hotel again. Amazing how one mattress can ruin your entire weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:39:37.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
