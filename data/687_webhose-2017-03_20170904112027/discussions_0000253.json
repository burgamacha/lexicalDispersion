Breakfast was reasonably good, as they served same variety for all six days....no change! The dinning area is too small for such a large hotel, most of the guests took breakfast to their rooms, so long queues at elevators in peak hours when you want to go to work!\nThis property is in a bad shape too....the rooms are extremely small & doesn't feel Holiday Inn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:40:18.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
