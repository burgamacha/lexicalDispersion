When I've stayed or had meetings in other Holiday Inn Hotels, there is a certain standard you expect. This is right on a busy road next to a cement works, so it's noisy and dusty, not really the hotels fault but it's a poor location. The refreshment requests weren't dealt with very well despite many emails to them, I had to ask again for Tea and Coffee after they initially said that wasn't booked. They did rectify this in the end, we had to use the breakfast area. The boardroom was in a poor condition, chipped tables, bits on the carpet and the air con/extractor wasn't great. The ladies toilets were also not up to standard according to my guest. I think in isolation, these issues would have been ok, but together it lead both of us to conclude: we wouldn't book this meeting room again.\nRoom Tip: Don't book the boardroom See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:41:46.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
