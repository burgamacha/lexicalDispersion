I went to this place to make reservations for a small function and the staff there misinformed me that I need not make any reservations before hand, I simply needed to come early and set up. There was also no mention of a corkage fee for our cake (yes, cake!). This was only revealed to me on the day of the function at the security check point!! On the D day , we received a very bad reception from the staff (specifically a one Daniel) who insisted that we should have made a personal phone call to him to make a booking, because the receptionist's guidance on reservations had been misleading. It implied that the first point of contact at the hotel (receptionist) was not to be relied on. Our food was also served cold and some of it had gone bad. The administration should take time to train the staff and improve their service delivery. I will not be dinning here again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:22:40.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
