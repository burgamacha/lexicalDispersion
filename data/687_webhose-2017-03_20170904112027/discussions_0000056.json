My bedroom was like sauna, the air 'cooling' system blew only hot air. The staff weren't helpful although I called guest relations twice asking if they could give me a room with air con that worked and saying I had a busy day ahead and wouldn't be able to sleep in such heat. After two phone calls and 50min later they sent me a fan, which was noisy and not very helpful. Otherwise the room would have been ok, not the cleanest but perfectly acceptable, comfortable bed and a very good breakfast, but I'm sorry, being able to sleep is a priority especially when on business. It's a shame and I'm giving in one star only as the staff didn't help and didn't rectify an issue I made them aware of twice in the space of one hour. For this prices there are better hotels to be found in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:55:45.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
