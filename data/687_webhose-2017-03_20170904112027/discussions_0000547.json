This was my least favorite. It does have a great location near Gare du nord.\nThe bed was comfortable. That is the extent of my compliments. The bathroom smelled like urine, the paint was peeling and the bed was so close to the end of the wall that we couldn't slide the suitcase thru, had to lift them over the bed. The staff was a mix of nice and cranky depending on who was up front. Tried to get change for 20 euro & they wouldn't do it. We had reserved a prepaid two course dinner and they wanted to serve us frozen lasagna & frozen risotto that they warmed up. We passed on that but was speechless over the frozen options. The breakfast was barely adequate so we passed on that too. Luckily lots of nearby cafes for full breakfast. I would not recommend this place until they refurbish it. The shower also didn't contain the water & was very slippery. I should've heeded the other reviews but we had just come from an ibis in Budapest & Stuttgart which were much better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:17:07.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
