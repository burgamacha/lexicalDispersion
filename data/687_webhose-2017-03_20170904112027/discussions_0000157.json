We arrived at 1.57pm to be told check in was at 2pm. Ok, I said , that's only three minutes. The receptionist laughed! We eventually got our key at 2.15pm, due to a person being late in checking out. (Not my problem!) The room was ok, with everything you needed, except ear plugs. More on that later!\nThe first morning we thought we would try the hotel breakfast. For â‚¬9.50 I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't disappointed. There was a small selection of bread, some cheese, some ham, and tea and coffee. That was the only hot thing available. There was also fruit juice and cereal. It was all overseen by a black version of Basil Fawlty, who watched everybody's every move, from behind a curtain. Not to make sure the food didn't run out, more as a food monitor and general nosey woman. Quite off putting. Also, the dining room was designed for dwarves, slim dwarves at that! Suffice to say, we ate out after that.\nThe walls are paper thin, we heard all sorts through them, toilet goings, squeaky door hinges, even nail clippers pinging off someone's talons. The worst though were the doors banging at all hours. We were woken up several times though the night because of it. Finally, the corridor outside our room was full of laundry bags, ready to be removed. They were there for hours. Not good.\nOn the plus side, the train station is two minutes away on foot.\nWouldn't stay here again I'm afraid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:41:29.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
