However at Armoni your room is minute and very dark chocolate brown - you feel like you're in a rabbit warren on entering the hotel and rooms.\nThere is minimal lighting throughout the hotel and you are often wandering around in near pitch black looking for a light switch in the corridor (they don't come on automatically).\nReception is minimalist - nicely decorated with small desk and staff are polite but not in the least bit friendly. You seem like a bit of an inconvenience being there.\nHotel has next to no amenities - other guests bought the breakfast for €15 but said it was pretty poor and only cold goods (there are plenty of fantastic bakeries/cafes on the streets that serve amazing produce with change from €5). Rooms have Apple TV but through our 3 days there it never connected. No English channels all French (except news).\nRooms have partitioned bathroom with a sliding door which is very small and not very soundproof!\nIn general just wasn't good enough - was meant to be a romantic trip but we simply avoided the hotel and spent as much time in the wonderful City as we could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:05:38.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
