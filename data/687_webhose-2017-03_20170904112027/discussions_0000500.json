However, on arrival, I was told that they had given the room which I had booked, a room with a King sized bed (which I specifically wanted and paid more for in comparison to other hotel options), had been given to someone else. They therefore gave me a room with two double beds, which they claimed was an upgrade. Yes, they thought giving 1 person 2 smaller beds was a good deal for me. I was told there were no other room options available, and no partial refund was possible.\nIn summary, BEWARE. You may pay more for a specific option when you book and it may seem a good deal, but it can be room roulette on arrival. Booking.com also refused to take any responsibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:31:37.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
