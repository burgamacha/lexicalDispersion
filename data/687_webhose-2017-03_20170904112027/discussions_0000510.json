First the good. The staff at checkin were very friendly and efficient. The room (exec jnr suite with park view) had an amazing view over Central Park and was a reasonable size.\nNow the bad:\nThe room and whole hotel is very dated and worn as is well overdue a refit.\nThe bathroom was clean but tatty, including chipped bath enamel and stained toilet pan.\nThere is very little soundproofing between rooms. We could hear our neighbours conversation like they were sitting in with us.\nThere is a mandatory reosrt charge of $35 inc tax per night. For this you get free wifi (any hotel should give this), free calls (everyone has a cell phone) and free wine beer and nibbles between 5pm and 7pm. This was in a room without enough capacity and was very strange. It offered no value. The charge is mandatory and as such it is a cash grab rip off.\nCaution NYC taxes on top of room charges. They are about another 15%\nSadly, I think you can do much better in NYC than this hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:04:47.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
