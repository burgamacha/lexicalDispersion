The room was EXTREMELY small. We were tripping over each other just trying to get ready for dinner and a night the opera. We've stayed at many of the hotels in the city and this was the smallest room we've ever had. Also, there was almost no view of the park even though we were on the 19th floor. We asked for an upgrade, but there wasn't one available, so they offered to send up champagne for our anniversary, which was nice....except that they left the champagne on the floor upon our return from the opera...with one champagne glass. Now, normally when you say its \"our anniversary\" it involves more than one person. My husband ended up drinking his champagne out of the small water glass they leave in the bathroom. We won't be back. Given the price of the rooms and the \"view\", it just don't line up with the cost. We've stayed in much nicer hotels for a fraction of the cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:21:08.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
