We booked a twin room via Booking but when we arrived only a room with double bed was available which we had to accept (No 2016). The following day in the morning we packed, took our luggages to the reception as we were asked by 3 different staff members, we were offered with another room on the 15th floor but suddenly a 4th staff member declined the change in an unacceptable style infront of other guests. He blamed Booking, they didnt offer any help, they clearly didnt want to try to solve the situation at all.\nI always stay in different Starwood hotels but I have never experienced a similar situation and I am very disappointed to receive this low value for my money. I will send a serious complaint about my disappointment and will recommend everyone to avoid this shameful service of this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:53:07.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
