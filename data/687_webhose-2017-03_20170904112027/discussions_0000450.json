The superior room were so small that you had to walk sideways to get around bed. Bathroom small.\nThe telephone did not work and even though we reported it for 2 days nothing happened. Eventually a serviceperson came, could not fix it and then told us we must dial the switchboard. That did not work either.\nThey give credit of a few dollars that is not enough for a breakfast.\nBreakfasts are ample but again very expensive. Better to venture outside to a diner.\nThe safe could not open and again we had to wait endlessly for service.\nThe service taxes are hefty and more than \"better rated\" hotels. Wifi were only in the foyer available\nWe will not visit them again\nRoom Tip: Avoid this hotel See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:54:32.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
