Not 5 star hotel standard at all. Halfway through checkin she had to excuse herself to find an umbrella for another hotel guest. The room was so unacceptable we refused to sleep in it and checked out. While the staff were polite and tried to make us stay by offering to move another bed into the suite to replace the sofa bed, it was not enough. Furthermore, we were not given a discount for the night we had to pay for despite not even using the room for more than 1 hour, even though the manager had agreed with our concerns and understood why we had to check out. Not enough was done to compensate us, and we are so glad we did not allow this to ruin our trip to Paris and had checked out.\nWe booked a suite with a terrace overlooking the eiffel tower. It was represented in photos as being large enough to comfortably have breakfast on the terrace, but when we checked in, the terrace we were given was so small we could only manage to stand on it. We had asked for an extra sofa bed at extra cost, but the sofa bed was so mediocre no one could have been expected to sleep on it- it was bent, and the mattress was so thin, I'm not sure it could be called a mattress as the metal frame was felt when one tried to lie on it. The actual room itself was small, and there was mould on the ceiling- disappointing for what is supposed to be a five star hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:47:43.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
