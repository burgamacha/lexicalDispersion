The room was gorgeous and large for Manhattan standards. However, we were on the 4th floor, corner room facing Rivington St. It was SO loud!! Neither my husband or I could get to sleep until 4am. Look, I get NYC is loud--I lived in Manhattan for over 8 years--but this was ridiculous. Sadly, it was a terrible experience for us.\nRoom Tip: Request a rear-facing or high floor room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:16:06.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
