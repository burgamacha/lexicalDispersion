Went on TripAdvisor to choose the best hotel in Stellenbosch according to the reviews, it was my husbands graduation and wanted to make it a special occasion.\nWhen we got there no one helped to carry our bags into the reception apparently the porter was on a tea break. I had psyched myself for the rooms as many guests had complained about the sizes and views. The room we got was alright though I expected a bit more from a 5 star. Not too much attention paid to detail in some of the fittings and decor. Food was excellent. Staff friendly and wifi quite fast and reliable. Spa is alright a bit crammed and cold.\nOn the down side. I was going to give the place a 4 but what happened after we left is disappointed me. I could not find a gold chain with a pendant that my husband gave me for our anniversary.\nI informed the hote of the issue but I had to keep following up the matter without any initiative coming from the hotel. If I didn't call no one called to give feedback. My email would be responded either after I called or after several hours. I am not accusing anyone of stealing the chain it's just that the last time I saw it was at the hotel and I expected more help and sympathy from their part and got very little. I know it was not the most expensive of chains but it was not cheap either and it meant a lot to me.\nI expected better.\nI let the hotel know how I felt but got no response to my email. I felt like they were saying you paid us already and left, we got what we wanted, what more do you want?!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:58:41.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
