The lobby area is very small and on first impressions was okay. Check in was easy and staff were friendly. However my room was on the 5th floor and I was told I could not reach this floor by lift I had to use the stairs, which was slightly confusing. The lift had seen better days, very dirty floor and railings. My room was at the end of a long corridor and was very isolated. DÃ©cor was very worn and the carpet had several marks on there.\nPlease don't be fooled by the pictures! My room was very dated with no modern element at all. Very small and quite unclean. The bedding had 2 large stains and the pillows were basically flat. The carpet had stains on and at several areas in the room was coming up off the floor and was very unsecure. The bathroom was dirty, toilet clearly had not been cleaned neither had the bath or shower head (which was green) There was also a very strange odour in the room.\nFurniture was also very dated and worn as was the bedding. The radiator was also very loud randomly and all I could hear was loud running water. The view from the room backed onto a block of houses which isn't unusual for London however the curtains were filthy. I ended up finding alternative accommodation as the room was so unsuitable.\nI would definitely not stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:52:03.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
