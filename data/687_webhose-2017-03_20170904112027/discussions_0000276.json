The room was like a broom cupboard and smelled of smoke. There were numerous cigarette burns in the night stand and people were smoking pot in adjacent rooms and the smell was awful. The front desk staff just kept repeating that this was a non smoking hotel and did nothing to make things better.\nThe temperature of the room was like a dry sauna and when we complained they said they would turn down the central air but then in a few hrs it was too hot. You could not open the window because the noise of the subway cars was too much.\nDo not stay here if you want to do anything other than crash after a party", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:52:21.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
