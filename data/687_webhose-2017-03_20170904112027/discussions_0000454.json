The room was so small that when the sofa bed was open there was literally no where to stand except at the entry to the room (in front of the bathroom). The closet was so small I could barely get my suitcase into it to get it out of the way. Here was no way to get into your suitcase without putting it across he bed the bed to open it up. It was truly unbelievable. We would have complained but we were too exhausted from a long week and a long drive to get there. And no free breakfast, which this brand usually has. Only positive--the staff was very friendly. My advice... stay here if you're solo or check the square footage of the room and caveat emptor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:26:09.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
