I had stayed at the brand new Courtyard just around the corner for the previous two nights, which was a much better experience, and the rate was half the price of this Marriott. I would have preferred to stay at the Courtyard, but they were fully booked for the extra night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:47:30.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
