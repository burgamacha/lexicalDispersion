When the heater was on though it sounded like there were people taking a shower in our room or outside our window was very loud and couldnt turn it off. Also the wifi was only working for half of our stay and we had to call the front desk a few times a day to get the router reset and eventually gave up and used the free NYC wifi outside the building.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:33:50.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
