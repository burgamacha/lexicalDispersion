Quite a few broken items in the hotel, ice machine was broken, vending machine was broken, no sign of it being fixed over the 4 days. Check out took 20 minutes and was painfully slow, they also tried to charge for breakfast which wasn't taken, found the staff all round to be poor and lacking service. Wifi was a disaster, not working the first night which we were told about, still not working 2nd night, staff just shrugged their shoulders. Paid 50 euros for 3 drinks in the bar so was very expensive as well. On the plus side the hotel was clean and close to the exhibition centre\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:52:11.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
