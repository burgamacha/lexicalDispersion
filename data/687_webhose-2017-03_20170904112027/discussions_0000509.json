I am surprised to see folks like Ayush or what ever the name\nOf the individual is who is very confrontational and seems to me that his personal issues are carried forward to his work place. I am very surprised to see him employed in a professional set up of Holiday Inn chain and he does not deserve to be part of this great hospitality chain. I hope my feedback is taken in the right context and corrective action implemented ASAP. Would be happy to chat with anyone from Holiday Inn chain should they have any need to contact me to implement the corrective action.\nYeshwanth Reddy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:46:10.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
