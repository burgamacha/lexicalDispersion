At check in, we were told that 800 euros needed to be blocked on our credit card. When we checked out Sunday, we were charged additionally for the stay. After we returned, we found out that the 800 euros that was allegedly \"blocked\" was actually charged to our credit card! When we called the property this afternoon, an insolent staff member who answered our call basically told us that \"this was hotel policy; someday they will refund the charge; but no, they could not tell us when; and that it would not be before at least a few weeks\"!!! We do not understand what gives this hotel the right to take an additional 800 euros of our money, and use it as long as they want!!!\nApart from this very upsetting experience, we think this hotel is hugely overrated. Other than a good location and decent rooms, we found nothing special about the place. For the same price, we found out that we could have stayed at the Intercontinental the Grand, or the Scribe, both around the corner, and much more impressive looking!\nWe are so upset that we will probably avoid the Indigo Hotel Chain forever!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:47:08.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
