The older man at the reception was very rude and blatantly racist. He addressed us by our country of origin and made us wait for over an hour, despite the fact that we had payed for our room the night before our actual arrival. He was extremely patronising and treated us like children, even saying our bags might have to be checked. His attitude seemed to change completely when speaking to a couple from a western background, greeting them warmly, like any hotel STAFF should do.\nOur room itself was terrible, with an open pipe in the bathroom flooding the whole room with the foul stench of sewerage.\nWe ended up checking out early due to our disgusting treatment and the terrible room and payed for another hotel on top of what we had payed for \"hotel\" eber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:12:38.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
