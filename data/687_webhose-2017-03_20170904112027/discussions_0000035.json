It was a 3 star dive with no air conditioning â€“ I had no idea it would be so hot in Paris. But I had a fan. I lived on water in ice buckets from the bar downstairs. I stupidly left the window open the first night and found my ceiling covered in small insects when I went to bed. The night reception guy I went to see to get some insect spray could not assist me. What a terrible hotel. The hotel was very old and tired. Some attempts to renovate were evident but they were cheap superficial - like painting over cracks. Today this hotel barely qualifies for its grading but for the price I have maximum convenience for location. I could not be more in the centre of where I want to go - but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone else - they would deserve something better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:38:09.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
