OK I get that- and we were given the same level of suite we had paid for, with kitchenette, coffee maker, cups, utensils etc. as I would expect. When we finally made it into the Wellington Suite it was large and roomy, it had a kitchen with fridge and microwave but NOTHING else- not even a basic coffee maker, cup, spoon...NOTHING! I don't want to cook a meal but a simple cup of tea would have been nice without braving the snow. Even the most basic hotel anywhere in the world gives you that and all those things were supplied at the Blakely so how hard can it be?Very disappointed right now and I am not usually one to complain.\nRoom Tip: Don't bother with a kitchenette as you can't use it See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:57:25.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
