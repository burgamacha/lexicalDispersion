Mistake!\nI’ll start by the positive things:\nGood location\nFriendly staff\nGood price for central London\nBut:\nThe bed was very small\nThe mattress was way too soft\nIt was clean…ish, it could have been better (e.g. the top shower bar was really dusty)\nWe booked a room in the lower floor (without window) and Internet was only working intermittently... Really annoying. We had to go upstairs a couple of times!\nThere was phone signal to make/receive phone calls... Really annoying too!\nThe air in the room was really stuffy, hot, smelly\nThe room and the whole corridor was smelly. It was really bad.\nIt was only bearable because we’re not too fuss and only spent little time in the room, but frankly I would never go back to this hotel and I would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the rooms with windows in the upper floors are better, I don’t know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:23:40.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
