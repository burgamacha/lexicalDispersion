We enjoyed the spectacular interior design, arts, SPA, branch and executive club.\nHowever, especially the service at the front desk was poor. We had several issues; the most annoying one was we almost had to give up using our late check-out benefit. We just wanted to make sure it can be confirmed or not but Mr. James never checked our booking status and immediately and strongly said NO to us. The level of service and communicating skills are not reached even the minimum level of 5star service standard over the globe.\nOn the other hand, Ms. Tiffany and Mr. James at the executive club, Coco and SPA team were so friendly, helpful and professional. Their warm and personal service towards us made our impression of this hotel much better. Really appreciate for their assistance and service excellence.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:47:51.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
