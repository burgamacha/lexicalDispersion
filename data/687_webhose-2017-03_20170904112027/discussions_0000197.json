I was delayed in Dallas and didn't arrive until late in the evening. The room I was given was sub-par and very noisy so I asked for an upgrade. I agreed to pay $100 a night for the upgrade. The room was much better but looked like a typical NYC apartment. I checked out 2 days later at 4 in the morning and told make a 6 o'clock flight and there was no-one available for the folio. I finally called 2 weeks later and requested a receipt to submit an expense report. I was suprised when I recieved the report andi was charged $200 per night for the upgrade. I talk to the accounting department and they asked me if I had a receipt for this. I said no because I wasn't given one. She said there was nothing she could do then. So now I am forced to pay for the upgrade out of my own pocket. Never stay here.\nRoom Tip: Don't face Madison Square Garden if you are a light sleeper See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:42:01.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
