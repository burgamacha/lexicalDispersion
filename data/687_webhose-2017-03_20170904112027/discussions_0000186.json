The room was unbearably hot, at least 30°C / 83°F...we had to leave our window, which overlooked a very noisy street, open in order to be inside the room or to sleep. The only answer front desk had for this was to turn off the radiator in the room, which we had already done.\nFurthermore the older lady in the breakfast room rushes up to you screaming BONJOUR over and over again without indicating that she needs your room number to note that you've had your breakfast. She needs to learn manners, I speak French fluently and still didn't know what she wanted because she didn't verbalize anything beyond screaming BONJOUR at you.\nThe bathroom shower is set up in such a way to guarantee that the floor gets soaked, and the floorboards loudly creak with every step so you wake up anyone else in the room.\nI would never ever waste my money here again, I can't believe more people don't mention the overwhelming heat. It's truly insufferable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:57:54.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
