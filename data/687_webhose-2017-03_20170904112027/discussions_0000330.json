We were happy enough with the room and the staff but shocked at the lack of service provided for the price we paid.We could have gotten a lot more at a different hotel for the price we paid. Not a 4 star hotel by any standard really. As we checked out at the desk they asked for my card details again to which i protested that we had already been charged when we arrived. They assured me that they were \"Just double checking our details\" as a standard measure and so I presented my debit card again as requested. Low and behold when i come to check my bank statement they have not only overcharged me for the room they have also charged me for it twice completely emptying my bank account of funds and leaving me stranded without any money on my journey home back to the UK. I have requested my bank investigate them for this fraudulent charge. Nice looking place but they have turned out otherwise pleasant anniversary celebration an absolute nightmare, STAY AWAY!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:59:52.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
