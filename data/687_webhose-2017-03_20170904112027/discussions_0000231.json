This is a serviceable hotel that charges reasonable rates for reasonable rooms. Yes they are small but I was sleeping here not planning to hold a ball so no need for a ballroom sized bedroom. The bed was comfy enough, obviously never as comfy as my own bed but I slept well. The room and the bed was spotlessly clean, a huge 10/10 for cleaning staff. The shower was powerful and again immaculately clean, although a tiny shower room it served it's purpose.\nStaff were on reception 24 hours and greeted us as we left just after 5am the first morning.\nOf course the street has noise, but buses, sirens, people putting rubbish out etc are all things that happen in a city during the night. If you want a silent night book a weekend in the cotswolds or lake district. If you want clean and comfortable rooms at a decent price in London then I'd recommend you book the Chiswick rooms. Convenient for the tube station, a great irish pub and restaurants close by are a bonus.\nThe room had a hairdryer and the shower had body wash but no shampoo or conditioner, I made the mistake of not bringing shampoo, but there is a little mini mart literally round the corner.\nI would stay here again if I was needing a hotel on this side of town.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:10:40.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
