Hilton midtown is a huge, anonymous hotel. So dirty that I wanted to call the public sanitation services. Stains on \"clean\" linen, fitted carpet from the 70's, no minibar, no coffee maker, NOTHING. I started sneezing since the very first minute I entered my room (and I've got no allergies). Dust everywhere. Even after calling the maid, the situation did not change. I left a small piece of crumbled paper on the floor to see what could happen. Nothing happened. It remained there for 4 days. When I checked out, it was still there. Oh, something happened, actually. I still have itchy legs 3 days after leaving the hotel. And you get it for hundreds of bucks. Shame on you.\nRoom Tip: Do NOT got there. That's all.
