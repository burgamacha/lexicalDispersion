I was appalled at the level of customer service. When we got to the front desk, we were told that there is a $34 charge. Which was fine, the receptionist took my card and swiped it. I then got a notification on my phone saying $84 have left my account. When I asked for an explanation as to why, the man could not tell me and went to get the manager. The manager arrived as explained that the additional $50 is a deposit in case something goes wrong in the hotel. This is fine, what is not fine is swiping my card and not telling me exactly how much you are removing from my account. There were scarce apologies, merely an explanation where the money went. When the customer service lady called to check up, I told her what happened, to which she said 'well sorry about that' and hung up on me. Would not recommend if you want to be treated like above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:09:40.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
