King bed with a sleeper sofa. Good size room. There were 2 adults and 2 children and we booked this room through TravelZoo. Rate Quote: d for 4 nights was $629 total. Quite a steal, however, we were charged a lot more than that by the hotel and also charged for 2 additional people by the hotel even though we had 2 children with us. The week we were there (2/22 - 2/25) was unusually warm. After being out all day, we came back to find the temperature in the room was 78 degrees. When we called hotel services, someone came up and just said \"it's not working, it can't come on.\" we got the feeling that maybe they did not have A/C but needless to say, he suggested that we either open the windows or use the large box fan that he brought us. I was not comfortable having the windows open with 2 children and no screens so we opted for the fan. it wasn't perfect but better than nothing at all. The hotel had more of an old school apartment building feel than that of a full service hotel. They did not have an exhaust fan in the bathroom so mirrors often fogged up and smells often lingered. outside of that the room was fine. Again, for 4 people in 1 room,we really had decent space. The bellman were friendly and front desk was helpful when we requested things. I do wish though they had informed us that they were charging us for the additional people considering there were just 2 adults and 2 children. The room was cool but with all that we are dealing with to get our money back, chances are we would not stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:58:45.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
