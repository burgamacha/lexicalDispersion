However, the dining, hotel and wine tasting experience were below expectations.\nHotel: room was not available upon arrival (1pm), but the reception was pressing insistingly to vacate by 11am. The accommodations were austere, with limited decorations, although views were fantastic!\nRestaurant \"Mise en Place\" was also very austere and cold, but food was good. Try the ceviche w/mango prepared by Brazilian chef Eduardo.\nBreakfast was quite generous and included in the rate. Ask for a terrace table to enjoy the views. Fruit juices are not natural, but processed.\nWine tasting was fun, but the wines poor quality, except for the Avalon blend. The experience again was nothing sophisticated, more focused on the commercial.\nSuggestion to management: getting back and forth from Stellenbosch was very complicated. You may want to offer transportation, since town is only 10 mins away by car.\nWould not return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:42:49.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
