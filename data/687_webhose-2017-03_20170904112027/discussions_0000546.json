God, I was wrong!! Tiny tiny tiny rooms. its like dorms all over again. Felt like Harry Potter who got the cupboard under the stairs for a bedroom. Ridiculous. But the tiny room, lack of closet/drawers for our stuff, tiny shower with no vanity, is not the worse part. The worst was the bed!! OMG so so terrible that my daughter and I, who came for a 'fun' mother/daughter weekend in the city, couldn't get a minute of sleep at night! it is simply Terrible! TERRIBLE!! yes, that bad! (when we complained in the morning to the manager she said its a known problem and other than saying 'sorry' 37 times, didn't do much we got no compensation). If you choose this hotel, don't say you didn't know! Much better choices in the area for the same price!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:00:37.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
