No matter what temperature the thermostat was set to, it would shift to 79 degrees. The laminate flooring was warped, and there were consistent puddles of water on the floor. Water was also found leaking from the radiator. In addition, why mention free wi-fi only to charge the client on the final bill? Doesn't free imply no charge?\nAll-in-all the room was adequate for the purposes of shelter from the blizzard, and the location was in excellent proximity to work. On a regular basis, I would not recommend this hotel for a stay while in NYC, unless all you need is a bed, and a place to freshen up. I now truly grasp ratings of Trip Advisor south of 3.9. On a positive note, the Staff is pleasant, and attention to guest needs were immediately attended to. The hotel location is central to many sights, and attractions in midtown Manhattan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:07:30.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
