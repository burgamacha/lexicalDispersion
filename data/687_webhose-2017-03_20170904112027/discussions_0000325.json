Beautiful room and great location. Fabian the manager was excellent. Unfortunately our stay was ruined by being woken at 8am from work men chopping down trees out side our window. This very loud noise continued for 3 hours. When I complained to the lady on reception she found it amusing that I was complaining and laughed in my face. I challenged her on this and she simply said 'it's not our fault. Irrelevant of who's fault it is she should have accepted responsibility and apologised instead of being rude and dismissive. I ask for the manager and she informed me there wasn't one in work till Monday. I then asked for a email address to contact him and she gave me it then proceeded to take a call before our conversation had ended. Disgusting customer service.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:46:44.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
