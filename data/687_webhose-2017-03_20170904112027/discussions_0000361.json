However, the lady from the reception desk wanted to charge me 300Euro and she gave me an attitude that she thought I didn't speak English before I was even going to ask her any question. I was confused and told her that I had paid everything through Hotel.com and I asked her what 300Euro was coming from. She told me it was \"government tax\" and did not bother explaining anything further. She went on and had my credit card wiped and made me sign the bill. This is my first time to France and I had a flight to catch so I did not want to start a fight with her that might ruin my day and I did really act like a gentleman. Fortunately, at the end, she somehow realized she made a mistake by herself and returned my money.
