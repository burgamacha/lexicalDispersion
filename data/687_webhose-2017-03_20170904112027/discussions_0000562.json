I should have done my research more thoroughly but having selected breakfast in the drop-down menu I assumed it would have a restaurant. I even emailed the hotel asking the same question prior to my arrival but alas I didn't receive a reply. suffice it to say that if you wanted breakfast they could offer you a pastry in the lobby for Â£4.00. No thank you!\nThe hotel though is modern and well presented but whoever took the photos did a great job in making the rooms (we booked two), appear much more spacious than they actually are.\nThe receptionist had a poor command of English but we did understand enough to hear that we received one bottle of water on the first night complimentary but on the second night, even though we were paying the same rate, it was extra. Why?\nOverall there are far better places to stay in London for similar money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:52:54.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
