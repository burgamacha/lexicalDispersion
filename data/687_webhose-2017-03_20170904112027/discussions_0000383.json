Restaurant very nice but food awful, i had fish and chips, not sure what fish it was, it was defiantly frozen and could not eat it. Steak for the wife was ok but not great quality. Ice cream for desert was awful, and flakes were some poor quality alternative, for Â£75 for 2 adults and 2 children i expect better. I would venture out of hotel for a decent meal.\nRoom Tip: No view from room!
