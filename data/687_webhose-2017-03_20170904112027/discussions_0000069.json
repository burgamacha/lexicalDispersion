Comparing to the other hotels that I've been with, the Receptionist on duty was less friendly, stiff and does not give equal service to all guests. She appears to be uncomfortable when questioned. A Cleaner just opened our door without even knocking. The Cleaner might have thought that there was no one in the room, however, it should be a standard of any hotel staff to knock on the door prior to opening it. It was not even our check out time yet when it happened. I would say that the best customer service that we got was from the Bell Man/luggage guy. The hotel room is just okay.
