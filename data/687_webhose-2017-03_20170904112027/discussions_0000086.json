Hot water is unreliable. The reception staff said at night they switch the hot water system off so my first night, having arrived late and tired had to shower in cold water. Other nights it was hard to get the right temperature, it was either burning hot or cold. This may be because of an end room -- xx01. Reception a bit sloppy, did not return my credit card and passport until next day. Safe is at floor level -- try entering the numbers to lock it. Lifts are slow, sometimes because housekeeping clogs up both lifts. Breakfast is contingental and OK. Location is good. Next door is a budget Chinese restaurant that offers meals from $6.50. There's a multi-outlet food place opposite - pizza, Korean, etc. The bukgogi is decent but is not accompanied by Chinese cabbage kimchi and they add tax on top of the listed price. Boss is somewhat garrulous.\nRoom Tip: Room xx01 faces the back, is quiet but may have water reliability issues.
