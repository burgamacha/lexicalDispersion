Absolutely stunning decor and a really lovely feel to it.\nI was upgraded to a suite due to aBooking.com error, so you can imagine I was pleased.\nThe hotel room safe didn't work, and they were unable to fix it, which was a little disappointing.\nWhat was COMPLETELY unacceptable was the bat service.\nI entered the bar at around 8pm. There were possible 4 people in there, all seated and with drinks.\nThe bar was unattended so I waited for around 3 minutes. Not ideal, but I wasn't on a schedule!\nWhen the female bartender finally arrived, I asked for a simple Gin and Tonic.\nHer response was unbelievable.\n'I cannot make this as I have to cook dinner for another customer.'\nI assumed I had mishear, so I asked for clarification. She repeated it!\nI explained that she could have served the drink in the time it took to say she couldn't. She still refused.\nIt is worth mentioning that I was the only person seeking service. She could have served me and gone to the kitchen (although why a hotel with these tariffs has a bartender also acting as a cool is beyond me).\nI left and complained at reception. The bartender followed me and tried to stop me by offering to make the drink! Madness.\nI left the hotel in disgust, only to be called back by the receptionist trying to make me accept a drink.\nThis is an awful level of customer care.\nOn checkout the next day, no enquiry was made as to my stay and no apology for the debacle.\nThis was such a a disappointment. I was in business, and was so impressed by the appearance of the place that I'd wanted to return socially, but clearly that won't be happening.\nAVOID.
