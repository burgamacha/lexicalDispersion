Firstly, there was only two plug sockets in the room, which were in awkward places, so charging devices was extremely difficult. The toilets did not have sinks, only in the rooms which was disruptive to other guests when using the toilet in the night. The wifi connection was extremely poor and mostly just did not work. There are no mirrors in the bathroom, meaning getting ready in the mornings was difficult and meant disrupting other guests in the room to use the mirror in there. The pillows were also uncomfortable. Breakfast was okay, a basic piece of crusty bread, a crossaint and orange juice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:05:39.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
