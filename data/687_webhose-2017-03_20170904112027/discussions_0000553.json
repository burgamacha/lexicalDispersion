After travelling for almost 18hours all we wanted was a nice shower and a bed to relax on for a few before heading out to see the sights NY has to offer.\nGot to Hotel Vetiver. Receptionist left us waiting about twenty minute before checking us in while talking to people who weren't checking in. While checking us in the receptionist was really friendly. Got to our room, we booked a double with balcony. Didn't get that. When I asked why he said we were upgraded as no balcony rooms available. The room we got was very nice.\nHeaded out to see the sights, get some food and a few drinks. All was going great. Until we went to bed. On the first night we did not sleep a wink. The noise coming from the reception area was shocking. The people in the rooms were been so loud. Eventually at 5.30AM we had to bang on the walls to try get them to stop but with no avail. Ok we said maybe that was just a once off and didn't say anything to reception.\nSecond night came. After been out on our feet all day from 10AM till 12AM we were exhausted and wanted a good sleep as we were wrecked from the previous night. We got into bed. Was nice and quiet until about 3AM and the noise was terrible once again. We contacted reception about the noise in another room. That did not work. Eventually it stopped at around 6AM. We got to sleep but people started working behind our room at 7.30AM. The noise they are making clearing up the snow at the back. We only got about 3 hours sleep on the second night. We are only aged between 24-28 and found the noise disturbing\nMaybe we just picked a bad weekend to come here. Hotel is genuinely lovely. The staff are very friendly. But just the noise is like people are in the room with us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:18:35.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
