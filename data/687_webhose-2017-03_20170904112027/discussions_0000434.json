My wife and I arrived at 1:30pm but were told that we cannot check in until 2pm. When we booked online, it said that checkin time was 1pm? We went for lunch and when we came back, we were given a room on the 2nd floor facing the street. The guy at the front desk did not seem friendly. Note that the room is very small and old. There is hardly any room to move around. The bathroom was also small. On the 2nd night, the heater in our room broke down. We went to the front desk 3 times to ask them about it. Finally, the lady brought a portable heater(?) to us. However, it did not seem to blow warm air. Breakfast was okay. The staff at breakfast were nice.\nWhen I called to ask how to get from the airport to the hotel, they said to take the Roissy bus. When we arrived at the hotel, however, there was an ad for airport shuttle for 18 euros. Why did they not tell us? Would not stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:37:32.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
