As a result there were ad-hoc lines being formed by customers in random places and checking in took a very long time.\nThe room was adequate and comfortable. The wifi was also excellent and I was able to stream videos on my laptop.\nI was quite busy during the night so I wanted to get food to the room. There were some food menus in the room. I rang the reception - no answer and so went down to reception. They said that they could prepare my food for me but that I would have to come back down and pick it up. I was literally a two minute walk away, would it have been too painful for the staff to just drop it off at my room? I would have tipped them generously....\nThen I wanted to sleep around 12am, but the chap next door had left his TV on full blast and wouldn't answer his phone or open his door when I came knocking. Again, no answer from reception when I tried to ring so had to go down and tell them to sort it out. It took them 30 minutes to get it sorted out.\nI know it's probably a one off set of experiences, but I won't be staying here again - despite the good location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:33:44.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
