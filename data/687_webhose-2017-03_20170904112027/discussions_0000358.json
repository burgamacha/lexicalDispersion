Perfect location. Rooms are okay, clean and with comfy beds. One tiny elevator, I can't imagine how it is on busy days but happy to be lucky to be there when it wasn't busy.\nI give this hotel one star rate because money is important and if they charge you irresponsibly, that's just not acceptable.\nI do not recommend any hotel that robs you.\nBe warned and be careful using your card when booking/staying at this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:32.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
