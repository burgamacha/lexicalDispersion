It seems like despite a polished look in the pictures, the hotel is tired and needs some attention.\nTo start with, my room had no ventilation - the window didn't open and the bathroom had no extractor, it was difficult to regulate the temperature too. The smell in the room seemed to have been there since months or years back.\nThe bed frame was unstable and the mattress tilted to the sides (repositioning me with it) every time I moved. The shower door didn't close and the water didn't drain. Thankfully it was clean.\nThe hotel itself was very noisy, on Sunday night, there was a lot of banging noise from around midnight, it sounded like somebody trying to fix something... Poor acoustics also meant that I heard every word from a room on the other side of the corridor.\nDay staff seemed ok, but the night guard was outright rude.\nI'm glad the stay didn't cost me much, because it was subsidised with loyalty points, but I would have been upset if I'd paid the full price!\nRoom Tip: Do not choose the 4th floor rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:20:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
