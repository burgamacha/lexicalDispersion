Because I was familiar with it, I decided to stay again, plus the rates were good. Big mistake. The guest service levels in this hotel have rapidly declined. Unhelpful staff. I called the \"customer service\" line (special button on the room phone) for some assistance with WiFi and got the most unhelpful associate who kept interrupting me rudely and didn't help me fix my issue. The room was nice except for two things. 1) the bathroom had a sour odor. I traced it to the shower curtain. It needs replaced. Yuck! 2) the walls in the rooms are paper thin. All night long I heard my next door neighbor hacking, coughing and gagging. So don't plan on restful night sleep! I won't ever stay here again. From the moment of my check in experience to my check out, it was not a pleasant experience or a restful stay. I don't appreciate rude staff who are unhelpful. Oh and by the way, the hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is WAY overpriced at $45 and the food isn't worth it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:47:56.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
