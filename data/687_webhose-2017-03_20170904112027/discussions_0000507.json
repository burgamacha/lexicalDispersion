As per a previous review, the works and industrial language began on the chime of 07:00 even on the Sunday. Did mention this to reception, but advised \"This is New York\" - Really\nDisappointed there wasn't any hot drink facilities in the room - could have mashed for the builders!\nRooms very small with you having to limbo around the television pole to get into bed.\nLocation good for most amenities though.\nSon and his girlfriend stayed in room 1141 and both received bites. I wouldn't like to jump to conclusions, however, it does point to the room.\nWould I stay here again - Probably not, especially room 1141. I'll await the standard response from the hotel manager", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:57:23.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
