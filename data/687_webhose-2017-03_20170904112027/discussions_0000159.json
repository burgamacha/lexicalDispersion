When we complained to Best Western, they said the same thing, namely that they are not responsible for it. Best Western should take this hotel off their list and Paris Police should look into the scandal of money being stolen at this hotel. In our case it was most certainly the taxi driver whom the hotel asked to help us in taking our luggage to the room as the hotel has no concierge/porters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:47:26.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
