The hotel was advertised using a picture of a view to central park. When we arrived, it honestly looked and felt like a residential building turned into a hotel and it was not even close to central park. When checked in and went up to our room, I was completely disappointed. The bathroom was so small. The view was of the wall fro. The building behind us or next to us i have no idea. The bed was small but it took up all of the room. There wasn't even a safe in the room. It felt like a cheap motel where people go with prostitutes. I couldn't even stay the night I immediately checked out and looked for another hotel. Currently trying to get my money back from groupon. I was able to take a panoramic picture of the whole room without moving as much as an inch. That's how small the room is.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:11:47.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
