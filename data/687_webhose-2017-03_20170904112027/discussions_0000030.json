No indication of valet service. Parked ourselves and then hauled our luggage across snow piles on street. No one to open door when we arrived at hotel...trying to get inside laden with luggage, coats, etc. Room is small but attractively done. Frosted glass walls used for bathroom allows the room not to appear so tight...but it is small. The bathroom is tastfully done with excellent toiletries. After late Saturday night....10:00am knock at the door what was so important? Restocking the mini-bar. Really??? When we told the front desk, they said they would tell housekeeping. We could tell they really didn't care. 3 of them behind desk which is about 35 feet front the front door....but we still had to struggle to manage luggage and get the door open because they were doing what ??? Behind the desk. SERVICE IS KEY - and this team failed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:03:03.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
