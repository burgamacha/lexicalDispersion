Last week I had booked a 3-night stay, guaranteed with my credit card, for June 2017, and the full payment was to be made at the hotel itself. There was no mention of any holding charge or pre-payment.\nI was shocked today to be informed by my bank that the hotel had tried to charge the entire stay cost for 3 nights today and when the same was not authorised by me, the hotel went ahead and charged a 1-night stay - even though the booking terms were otherwise.\nHave cancelled the reservation at the hotel and asked for immediate refund of the charge to my credit card.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:30:53.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
