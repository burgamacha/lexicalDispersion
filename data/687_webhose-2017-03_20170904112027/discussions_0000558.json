Did have to pay extra to leave our bags in the room 1h earlier although there was plenty of rooms empty. We stayed for 3 nights and we didn't not get any new towels, the cleaner was not even visiting our rooms during our time. When we mentioned it they said they would get us new towels, but we did not get any. Extremely poor service, very bad start for a new hotel who wants to attract new customers. This is a hostel, not a hotel. But it is cheap, you get what you pay for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:22:44.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
