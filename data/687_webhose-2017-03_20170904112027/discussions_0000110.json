Arrived, tired after a 12 hour day, to a shabby, roadside room that didn't lock from the inside. Returned to reception. Changed rooms. This time electrics were making loud noise. Retuned to reception to change rooms. Room number three has mould, a sink that doesn't drain properly, dirt round the light switch, view of car park. Too tired to change. Day two, returned from work. Key to room didn't work. Lots of people at reception. Had to wait. No apology from reception except to say phones deactivate room keys. Room number given out loud (not something that should be done with single travellers) and against prem inn policy. I spend around 2-3 days a month with this hotel chain. I'm on the lookout for somewhere else to stay from now on.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:38:54.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
