Unfortunately we had pre-booked so the manager wouldn't let us out of our commitment. After we voiced our concerns we were shown another, similar room. My husband suggested the rooms were nothing like advertised and we were eventually given a lighter upstairs room.\nThe ice machine spat ice loudly all night so we hardly slept!\nThe breakfast room is a help-yourself canteen with no windows, paper plates and cups and bad coffee. There is no service and no cleaning up in the cramped room but...a large \"tips\" box.\nThe next day my family crossed the road in Koreatown and found a clean, bright hotel with kind and helpful concierge, large bright rooms and for almost US$100 less a night!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:37:24.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
