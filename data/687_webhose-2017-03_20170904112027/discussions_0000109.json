One big showstopper; STAFF STEALS MONEY FROM BAGS and management does not care. We left our bags for a couple of hours at deposit after check-out. Before dropping off my bags I checked my wallet and I had â‚¬200 in separate section. When we arrived back in Holland money was missing from my bag as well as my son's. I immediately called and left message on voicemail of Security Manager. No response. I called again and again no reaction. I emailed that management and again no reaction. Conclusion; watch your valuable belonings even when you leave them in the \"secured\" deposit. And don't expect too much from the management when things go wrong. Other than that, again, good value for money!\nRoom Tip: Try to get room with view at 7th.
