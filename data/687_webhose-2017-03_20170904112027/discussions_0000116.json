I was not told about the decoration work at this hotel either from my booking company, or from the hotel on arrival.\nI stayed in room 401, which is a great little room by the way, but the smell of the paint coming from the corridors outside was unbearable. I got a headache throuhout the night from the smell of paint, which is a shame, because the hotel is a lovely hotel and enjoys a great location.\nIf I had a chance I would have liked to have tried their Indian Restaurant, as the menu looked quite appetising. Perhaps next time.\nThe continental breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and good quality.\nThe hotel management was not interested about my views on the paint smell issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:04:59.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
