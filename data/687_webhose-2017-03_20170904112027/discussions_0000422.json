There is no place to sit except on the bed. You have just inches between the bed and the walk to move around. It's also too dark in the rooms. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to look around for things on the shelves and floor. The hallways are dark with bright green doors. Reminds me of a bad dormitory building. The location is great and Fluffys next door offers great food at a cheap price. The lobby is beautiful and the room was clean. If I was 20 years younger it would have been fine but I'm just past the stage of bad hotel rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:50:10.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
