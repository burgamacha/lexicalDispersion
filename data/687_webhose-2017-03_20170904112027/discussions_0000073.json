We stayed one night and didn't sleep a bit! The walls are paper thin. In one adjacent room we heard a man coughing all night and in the other adjacent room we heard a group of college students come in at 3:30 am and party in their room until 5 am! My kids didn't sleep at all! Also, neither TV worked. Called front desk for a repair but neither was fixed. Next time I will pay more for a room at another hotel with better insulation and a quieter setting. A good deal is not so good if you don't get any sleep!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:31:44.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
