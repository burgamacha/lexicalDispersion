Overall the theme of the hotel was love but sadly the love affair had that faded feel of two lovers meeting up in the autumn of their lives. The room we stayed in had no shower screen so floor was always wet after shower; windows single glazed so noisy; maybe a good idea to have toilet separate but not so good to have to straddle the toilet and then reach behind yourself to close it; woken on two nights by the occupant of room next door walking across the room in her (or his) stiletto heels. Would I stay there again? - will England win the world cup again?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:43:31.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
