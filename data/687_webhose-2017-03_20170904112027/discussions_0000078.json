It is old, they've tried to update it a bit, but beware. There is a VACATE sign from the city of NYC posted to the front lobby glass.\nThere was blood on the rollaway sheets. After asking for new ones, I found large blood stains on the underside of the mattress. I requested a replacement, so my daughter could sleep in sanitary conditions.\nOther issues:\nThere are bugs jumping in the bathroom.\nIt's sweltering in the middle of winter.\nThe hall smells like wet dog, probably due to the hostel community bathroom down the hallway.\nThe guests are up all night and bang the doors. You can't sleep here!\nBeware! It's centrally located to our track event, but I'll stay at another hotel.\nSee pictures.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:09:51.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
