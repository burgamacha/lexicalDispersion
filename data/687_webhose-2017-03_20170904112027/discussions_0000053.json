Rooms are very tatty and they now do not put bottles of water in the rooms or soap (only shower gel) in the bathrooms. I had a dirty tea cup in my room, the teas etc were not replenished, old water had been left in the kettle and my bed had crumbs all over it. It looked like the room had not been cleaned.\nI am a silver level member (which should be gold by now but doesn't seem to ever change!) and I'm afraid a posh envelope to keep my room card in and a free drink does not cut it for me as a loyal customer. No complimentary upgrades are ever offered anymore and on this occasion I was put next door to the noisiest travellers ever! No good whatsoever for the business traveller needing sleep. I used to stay here every week or twice a month but no more. I will find another hotel.
