However I found the room claustrophobically tiny and not to my liking. Grey dust rained down upon me when I reached up on to the top of a high shelf. It is a nice area to stay. But the hotel was not up to standard. But the worst part was, my travelling companion took ill at a nearby caf√©. I asked the receptionist if I could get the details for a doctor in case I needed it. She assured me that although she didn't know, she would find out and call the room. That call never came. I was horrified that the welfare of an unwell guest meant nothing to this hotel. I complained to the manager about it via email but it was after the fact and nothing could change that experience. I do not recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:01:18.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
