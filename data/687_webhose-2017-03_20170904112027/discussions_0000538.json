Access to multiple subway lines and Penn Station. There are two supermarkets within two blocks away. Macy's, ESB & Korean town are just a stone throw away.\nRoom: itself is nicely appointed. However, my room 1106 had some water damage underneath the frosted glass. The glass itself can be either interesting or embarrassing depending on who you're sharing the room with. Additionally, walls are pretty thin. Every time one of my neighbors leaves, my headboard shakes. Lastly, there's no separate recycling bin in my room, so the maid probably commingle everything.\nPrice: I booked directly through Meliá. However, if you have the HT app, the queen size room is available for considerably less, ~$125 (+ tax)\nStaff: manager Justin was rather unaccommodating nor could he think out of the box to provide reasonable solutions.\nPretty façade but lacked service mentality and substance. There would be better options out there.\nNot impressed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:32:25.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
