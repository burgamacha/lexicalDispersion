The hotel is clean and the frontdesk is friendly. Didn't take breakfast because there are a lot of better and cheaper choices outside. The room is small but was OK for us because we only used it for staying at night. The room is clean. Looking out of the window only a bit of sky was seen. To see the street, you have to pay more I suppose. There is a telephone, TV and a kettle in the room. The toilet is small but the shower cabin is only for persons of medium size or below. If you are size Large you won't be able to fit in and take a shower. As for the towels, doesn't cover your head or body even if you are medium size. All in all clean and in the center of the city very close to touristic places.\nRoom Tip: Rooms ending with 7 are small and have very small shower cabin. Mine was 407 See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:11:05.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
