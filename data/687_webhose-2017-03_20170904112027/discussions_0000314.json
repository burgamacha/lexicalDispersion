We got a new room though that was a bit better. We also have to mention the communication style with the reception, it is very poor both through email and face to face. They answer late and poorly my emails, and I even got no reply at all. I forgot my necklace in our room and it took them 8 days to check it out for me and then someone had taken it. I will never stay there again, that is for sure. The communcation face to face is just dull and not interesting at all. You really have to pick up a new ways of doing things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:03:48.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
