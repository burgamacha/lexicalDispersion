We filed a complaint via security who assured us the room tax would not be deducted (on our departure the following day) until an investigation launched and completed (to take place on the Monday) and the outcome of that investigation relayed to us. I was very upset to find that the room tax was deducted from my credit card pretty much soon after we checked out of the hotel on the Saturday afternoon. I have never heard from the hotel since, despite emailing them for an update. Very disappointing. My son paid $US210 for a Stone Island jumper and the bag was a part of that purchase. The bottles were collected, and memories attached, to each of them throughout our trip. The hotel manager appeared quite unconcerned that these items were removed from our room. Furthermore, they deducted the room tax despite assuring me they wouldn't. Very poor service indeed. On that basis alone, I would not recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:05:11.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
