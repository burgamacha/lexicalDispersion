The hotel in general is comfortable and the food and bar seemed okay. It meets the requirements of any hotel like this. The coffee facility and iron in the room were really helpful. The reception staff were very friendly and the exhibition went well. If I stop here they'd get a decent 4 out of 5, so in general you'd expect a good stay.\nThe room was set to 10 degrees so waking at 5am freezing cold I finally found the thermostat, but unfortunately by then it was too late. This seemed to me a minor flaw and if I went back I would now know to check this, though I would suggest that they'd be better in the colder months for the hotel to set it higher. I can guess they did this to keep their energy use down.\nThe main problem with this hotel is it charges £1.50 per hour for parking and subsequently I ended up paying an extra £39 for a nights stay. If staying for more than one night it is a considerable amount to add on. For residents anything above a pound an hour seems excessive. As for those that attended the exhibition they were left with £3 an hour charges and you could see them all leaving as soon as they could.\nSadly, I can't imagine wanting to return. London has so many choices for hotels. I'd ask people to stop arranging business meetings and shows here.\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing the city, as the back is facing a construction site See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:55:36.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
