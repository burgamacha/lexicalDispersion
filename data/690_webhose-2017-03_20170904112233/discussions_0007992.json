Food portions in bar were very large (I wish we'd ordered one between two of us). Breakfast had plenty of choice (more than is usual in this type of hotel). Service mostly very good and helpful. The only real negative was the presence of bags of used linen and rubbish left in corridor to room throughout the evening (we mentioned this on departure). Parking was pretty expensive (even at the discounted rate) but then this is London. The walk to the Apollo was short and straightforward. We might well stay here again if we need to go to that venue in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:01:07.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
