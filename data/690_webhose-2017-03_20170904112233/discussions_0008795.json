Located at the end of brick lane and just 30m for the aldgate east tube stop, it ticked all the boxes we would want in a hotel.\nCheck-in was smooth, the lobby area is very modern and the room was also well presented with a great shower. There is also free wifi and freeview.\nBreakfast was excellent. We had the continental option but there was plenty to chosoe from and the staff were professional and courteous. You could also upgrade to the full English but we didn't feel the need to.\nWhen you're in London you should be using the hotel as a base from which to explore the city and this hotel ticked all the boxed; great value in a good location and with excellent staff.
