Very impressed again by the service and standard of the rooms in the hotel. Only had one issue at check in as had checked in on the train on way to hotel and my details weren't recognised, however very quickly fished the attentive team at reception. We left our bags in a secure room,\nOf,the two rooms I got the smaller but both very good size, room (414) (421) a bigger family room.\nWe went out for the day for stag Do events and returned to actually get to our rooms about 6:30 for a fast turnaround as meal at Tayyabs was booked for 7:30. Needed a iron and reception helped out very quickly.\nStaggered back to hotel as people where getting up for breakfast next morning, used full time of 12 checkout on the Sunday for a kip.\nVery happy with our service with the hotel and the staff, attentive enough, there when you need them, no issue to small or two big I noticed to help. I have rebooked another 4 Premierinn hotels for cycling events I am undertaking over the summer across the. Country including this one for Prudiential 100 in the summer. So look forward to experiencing the service standards again and again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:32:56.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
