It's a fairly small hotel which feels very intimate. The location is 5 minutes from Paddington Station which makes it very easy to get to/from Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. There is also tube service from Paddington that connects you to the rest of London. The neighborhood overall is residential but there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance and we prefer to be away from all the city noise when we travel.\nThe room was great. We were upgraded to a room with a four poster bed, a small living room, bathroom, and a balcony with two chairs and a table (unfortunately it was too cold in London to make use of the balcony). The room was very quiet and comfortable.\nOur rate included breakfast which consisted of juices, milk, yogurt, toppings for the yogurt (e.g. granola), fruit, and pastries. For an additional charge, we ordered bacon or other sides. It was delicious!\nThe staff was also incredibly friendly and helpful.\nMy only complaint about our stay was the WiFi which makes you re-enter your password every time you disconnect and then return to your room which is annoying (but manageable).\nWe'll definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to London!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:47:21.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
