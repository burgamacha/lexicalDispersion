The mini bar was complimentary and restocked daily which was fantastic. All the staff were very welcoming and friendly. The location of the hotel is brilliant. It's very central and the main attractions are all walking distance. And the breakfast was amazing!! As much choice as an all inclusive hotel! There was fresh fruit every day, pastries and cakes, hot food, juices... and the staff come round the tables with more offerings such as mozarella and different pastries. The ice cream palour next door to the hotel is a must to visit too!\nI highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return.
