We were not disappointed. The taxi man did find it hard to locate so make sure you have the address in Chinese writing. They offered a complimentary Airport pick up which we used when departing as we came in on the Bullet train. It was winter weather but the whole place was very cosy and friendly staff were so helpful. Loved the restaurant so much went back two nights in a row - very busy so recommend booking if possible. A great way to enjoy Bejing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:37:37.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
