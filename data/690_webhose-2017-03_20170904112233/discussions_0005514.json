I ate most nights in the Grill restaurant which had gluten free markings on the menu. I was also provided with gluten free bread with oil, vinegar and pesto whilst waiting for my meal which was really nice. I even got room service one night which was very nice, although I did go to speak to the restaurant manager to make sure it was ok.\nOverall I couldn't have asked more from the staff who were incredibly helpful.\nThe rooms were large and bed comfy with a good tv selection. The room could do with a bit of updating, I think it used to be a smoking room as the shower curtain smelt of smoke, but it was still a nice room.\nThe concierge was also very helpful with getting taxis to work everyday.\nI would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:59:14.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
