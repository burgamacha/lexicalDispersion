You can walk to all corners of Paris from here. Staff are friendly and try their best to keep customers happy, within reason (I have overheard some strange conversations at reception!).\nThe standard rooms can be small but all hotel rooms in Paris are pretty tiny. If you have status you will normally be given an upgrade, space permitting - as a Platinum I've been given an Ambassador Suite in the past - on a corner overlooking the Louvre and the gardens, beautiful - and that was during Paris Fashion Week; and on my recent visit they outdid this by with a stunning Royal Suite, wood and mirror panelled, it looked like something out of Versailles... absolutely incredible. We didn't want to leave the room....\nThe breakfast is great, and recently improved - it can be crowded towards the end so an early start gives you a quieter, calmer environment.\nWe love the Westin and will keep coming back!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:18:44.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
