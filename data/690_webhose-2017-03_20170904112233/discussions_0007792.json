For part of my stay I was a single, 30-something, female traveller. I felt completely safe and comfortable in this hotel, at all times of the day. All staff were friendly, welcoming and accommodating. The location of this hotel is perfect, I didn't have a view that some people may call a view, but to me the street views (from the 3rd and 7th floors) of NYC are always fab. I had no issues walking around Midtown and Downtown by myself, in fact, it's quite liberating and enjoyable. I wouldn't have any qualms travelling and staying at the Roosevelt completely by myself. Actually I am looking forward to doing just that. As others have mentioned, the elevators/lifts can be on the slow side, especially in the mornings but this didn't affect my day too much. Usually after long days of walking around NYC, by time I returned back, the elevators were arriving within a few seconds. Out of all the hotels I've stayed in New York, with the overall experience and location, so far, this one wins hands down. Thank you for a memorable and wonderful stay, Roosevelt Hotel. I'll be glad to see you again soon. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:28:44.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
