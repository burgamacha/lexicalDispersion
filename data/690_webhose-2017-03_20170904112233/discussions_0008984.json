The staff was so nice and accommodating and most importantly the room was very very clean and spacious. Also, the products in the bathroom were awesome - very high quality, also larger bottles compared to other hotels I've stayed at. Loved the facilities as well, I used the gym both days I was there - also VERY clean. And the bed was super comfortable too. Can't say anything negative about my experience. I would definitely stay there again!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:57:47.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
