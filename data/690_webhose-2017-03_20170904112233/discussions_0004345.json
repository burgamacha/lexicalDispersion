The recent remodel is beautiful. The rooms are small ( but thats Europe ). The linens and bed were top quality. The staff were very helpful with all of our questions and provided suggestions for eating and transportation. Phillip (the owner) happened to stop by while we were discussing a restaurant list our daughter had provided and showed us where they were located on the map. Thanks Phillip! The basement where breakfast is served had to be my favorite room, although the sitting room is nice also in this 250 year old building. Everything you could want or need is within walking distance. We will return!\nRoom Tip: If you are traveling with a lot of luggage book a large room.
