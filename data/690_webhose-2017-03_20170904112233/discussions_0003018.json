The rooms were very nice and ours had a view of the San Francisco Bay. The staff was very helpful and friendly. A few days prior we had stayed at a different Doubletree in another state and the two stays could not have been more different. Here the staff went out of its way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We reported a small breakage in our room just to let them know so they could fix it. The front desk was very apologetic and asked what they could do to make it up to us.\nRoom Tip: Rooms on the south side offer a view of the Bay See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:01:13.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
