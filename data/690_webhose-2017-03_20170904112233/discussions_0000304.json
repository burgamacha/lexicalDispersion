It’s one the best hotel we have ever stayed and for sure the best in London. All good comments we had read here were right but you do not realize how good it is until you are there. You feel you are in the US in the 30’s.\nBut apart from the setting and deco, which is superb by the way, the service you receive since you make your booking on internet to the moment you leave is amazing! Top class! Long before we arrived we received emails from Isabelle who provided us with information and suggestion on what to do at New Year’s Eve.\nBut we were so happy there that we didn’t mind staying in and enjoy the bar and the grill. If you stay there, have a drink at the bar and then dinner at the grill. You won’t be disappointed.\nIn top of that, the location could not be better. It’s just few steps from Oxford St.\nThank you very much to the whole team for every single detail you had with us (cake, chocolates, good vibes) and for for making our stay very special. We will come back!\nRoom Tip: Grab a drink at the bar and then the grill.
