Two of us are avid readers and the theme/decor was charming and fun. The rooms are efficiently but adequately sized and have the amenities you need for a stay of a few days. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The midtown location is perfect for a theater-focused weekend, close enough to walk but far from the maddening crowds. The value is excellent, also. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the plumbing was a bit dicey - toilet sometimes didn't fill, tub drained slowly. The staff did what they could to address it. We have stayed in a lot of NY hotels, some extremely high-end, and definitely will return to the Library Hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:24:39.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
