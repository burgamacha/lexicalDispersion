We were planning a surprise trip for a family member and I was lucky enough to work with Quimby. The service and attention to detail provided by Quimby and everyone else at the Park Central hotel was exceptional. I have read other reviews complaining about the team at the hotel and I would disagree 100%. Quimby was a pure joy and a pleasure to work with. I was honestly blown away by the steps he personally took to ensure our trip was amazing. Thank you to Quimby and the Park Central hotel. It was a trip that we will be talking about for years to come!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:24:31.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
