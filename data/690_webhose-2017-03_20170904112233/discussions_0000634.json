We upgraded to one of the one bedroom suites (room 501) and it was SO comfortable. It was literally like being in a small one bedroom apartment without the kitchen. Two balconies which was nice even if you use the doors just to let fresh air in the rooms. The automatic shutters on the French doors for the balconies completely blocked all light. We were sleeping so well with the quiet dark room and the incredibly comfortable bed. We had champagne, fresh flowers, and chocolates in the room waiting for us after we went out for a walk on our first afternoon. We had breakfast included and they were very accommodating for my picky husband and son. We enjoyed a big breakfast every morning before heading out. I used the fitness center and sauna. The spa looked very nice, I just did not have the opportunity to have any treatments done. It was a wonderful stay. The location, size of the room, service, and details are all outstanding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:58:05.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
