As for accommodation first rate. Contemporary and classy. Just the two of us so we had a studio - great size - great kitchen and bathroom which was impeccably clean . Just across road from Subway but easy walk to Staton Island Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge and 9/11 Memorial. Slightly longer but fine walk to China Town and Little Italy. Short subway ride to the tac of Times Square.\nReally cannot fault anything !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:27:45.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
