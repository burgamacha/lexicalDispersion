She is remarkable and did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable. If I owned a hotel, I would employ her.\nThe hotel is in a great location for exploring St Germaine and the major sights with interesting art galleries, restaurants and shops nearby.\nThe rooms are small but elegant and perfectly formed with fluffy bathrobes and all the lovely extras you expect.\nAnd as for your private spa... Wonderful.\nI would not hesitate to return to this hotel.\nThank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:21:56.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
