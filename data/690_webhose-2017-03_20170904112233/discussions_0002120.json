We arrived to the hotel, checked it and went into the room. Then I realized that the room that we got was a queen not a king room.\nSo, I went and tried to get the right room - reception staff claimed that I made a mistake during my reservation but I clearly remembered that I did order the king room - we were 3 women staying in the hotel room so we needed a bigger room.\nFinally, they said that they can only move us to a king room next day and will give me a discount of $25.00 for the 1st night. OK, nothing to do but to accept it. So, the first night at the hotel - when we pulled out the sofa bed, there was hardly any space to walk in the room! So, we were happy when we got in the king room â€“ at least there were more space there. Was nice to have kitchenette as well to have some food there.\nHotel itself:\nGood location. Close to the park and everything. Breakfast all right, not too many healthy options. lots of people. But possible to get a table.\nThere is a coffee shop next to the hotel, all shops, MACY's mall close to it, Times Square, etc.\nSofa bed - almost impossible to sleep since the mattress is very old and bad. Bathroom is kind of small.\nWifi - all right.\nGeneral impression - average hotel. Good location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:49:47.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
