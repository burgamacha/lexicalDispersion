The beds were comfy, the pillows even more so. The views from the floor-to-ceiling windows was awesome! I would open the window a bit and it was nice because it allowed me to clear out the smell of food when my kids would eat in the room.\nThe bathroom was a generous size. Good, soft towels were available and the hair dryer was nice and strong. My only comment is that there is no exhaust fan for the bathroom.\nOh, be prepared for a *lot* of static! Every time we would touch the door handle, bathroom door, elevator buttons, even each other (!) we would get zapped.\nOverall, the Hyatt was a great choice. I would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:18:48.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
