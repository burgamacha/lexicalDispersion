The Muse is at a perfect location with Times Square a short walk away and 5th Ave just east of the hotel. We were greeted warmly on check in and the staff couldn't have been nicer. You have different options for rooms from one with a deck to one with a jetted tub. Rooms are very nice a very clean. After dinner we stopped in the bar for a drink. The bartender was very friendly and we had a great conversation with him about the different Broadway shows. The hotel is pricey but look for specials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:23:17.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
