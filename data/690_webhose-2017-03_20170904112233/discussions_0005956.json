The concierge were really good and helpful and helped us book restaurants. The hotel is right next to Arc de Triumph which made it easy to get to. The rooms were good and spacious and ideal for a city break. I feel the hotel was good value for money and happily recommend this hotel. The only thing which I didn't like about the hotel is price for room service which was excessively high for a croissant which we got from the many patisserie's a couple of minutes walk away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:38:45.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
