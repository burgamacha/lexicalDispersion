I was sure what we were going to get because we booked through Costco for the first time, ever. The best experience. Room was clean, everything was clean. The complimentary breakfast was American style (Thank God). The staff was very friendly and nice. The restaurant was a bit pricey, but the staff provided valuable service. The best part was the close proximity to the train station, Republic Square and everything was in 15 minute walking distance. Very pleasant stay!\nRoom Tip: Choose a room with a view!!!!
