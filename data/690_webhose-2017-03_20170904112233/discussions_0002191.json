We had the 28 floor and it was so lovely to see the city light up at night.\nNo problem with noise.\nThe rooms are adequate size, by the end of the trip they felt small- but I was not in the room much.\nThey were clean.\nI brought some basic utensils from home to eat / cook with when I did not feel like eating out. The coffee machine boils water.\nI brought ice up from the basement to keep things cold- and kept it by the window (it was snowing)\nThe bathroom was small but sufficient, great showers!!.\nLifts:\nGood 3 lifts- I think once at 8.40am I had to wait up to 5 minutes for the lift, other than that they were great.\nService:\nThe staff were so friendly and really made an effort. I wish i wrote down their names to give them the credit they deserve. It made such a difference, travelling to such a huge city can be stressfull and they put my mind at ease.\nFood:\nI only had breakfast here- which was good enough.\nI 100% would be back again.\nRoom Tip: level 28 had good city view rooms.
