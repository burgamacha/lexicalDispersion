Having the Bryant Park just in front of the door makes the place special as it is always an invitation for a shot walk, grabbing some coffee or waffles in one of the charming spots within the park...or just sitting there to relax.\nInside the hotel, modern look, rooms quite spacious and clean look. The biggest bathroom I manage to see in a NY hotel...impressive.\nAs opportunities to improve, I would recommend a revamp of the elevators...a bit too dark. Music inside elevators and in the hall could be tuned down, specially in the morning when not necessarily guests are in a party mood.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:05:01.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
