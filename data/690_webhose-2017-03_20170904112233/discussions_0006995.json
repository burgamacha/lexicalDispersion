She reviewed the hotel and booked for 5 days. Travelled by East Midlands rail to St. Pancras and then Eurostar to Paris.

The hotel is very well situated in a nice area close to quality bistros and restaurants, we'd recommend Le Grand Colbert which isn't cheap and pre booking is a must, also the 3 course set menu at Restaurant 58 on the Eiffel Tower is good especially late afternoon/evening and it's approx. a 10 minute walk down to the Seine/Louvre.
