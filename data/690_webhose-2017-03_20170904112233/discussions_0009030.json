The location and price we paid are unbeatable value for money given it's a minute from Westminster bridge!\nWe arrived early at 12.30pm and the friendly check in staff obliged us with a ground floor family room which was perfect for us.\nClean, spacious comfortable room with two kids beds, the breakfast was delicious, plentiful and hot as usual.\nWe ate at the restaurant one evening, upgrading to meal deal which is great value (especially in London!) for Breakfast + 2 course meal and a drink for Â£25. The service was excellent here.\nWe ate at Planet Hollywood one evening which is a 20 minute walk.\nIn the words of one of the ex-owners of that establishment - I'LL BE BACK !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:16:22.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
