Staff were very helpful and friendly always saying hello to us. We ate breakfast once in the hotel which was lovely, the bar area is also lovely for a nice drink after being out exploring the city. Our room was quite small, however for the amount of time we were spending in it it was acceptable. As we were there for special birthdays, we returned to our room one night to a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake, a nice surprise!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:26:51.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
