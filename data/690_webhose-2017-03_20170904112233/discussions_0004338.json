Boy do we feel lucky. We were placed at the Pullman Pairs Tour Eiffel and could not be happier. While our room actually doesn't look toward the tower, we look toward the Mercure, we can see the reflection of the tower in the windows, especially at night. Our room is quiet and comfortable, the staff has been helpful and even print our tickets to the Louvre when the printer in the lobby was not working. The free WiFi has been great, sometimes a bit slow, and the breakfast has been wonderful with great yogurt, amazing \"sweet waffles\" and made to order omelets that have been perfect for a full day of walking the City of Lights.\nRoom Tip: Upper floors facing the tower would be worth the extra for a \"real experience\". See more room tips Green Features: Key card activated lights and power, towel on the rack to save trees a nice idea too. Windows open and let in, yes fresh air. Ability to control temperature in the room as well as turn off the HVAC as needed.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:58:42.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
