The hotel is quite newly refurbished and was nice and clean. We had a family room on lower ground with good space all in all, but lacking storage space, and things to hang clothes on. The bathroom was quite small, and nowhere to put own toilet belongings. Good shower though. The wifi in the room was very poor, so we used own mobile data instead. Breakfast was ok, not to many choices, but the food was fresh. Missing bacon and eggs... The staff was both helpful and nice, all in all a good hotel for a weekend stay :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:09:02.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
