What makes this property second to none are specifically the stuff who are so helpfully and cant do enough to turn your moments to memories. Thank you very much Mr. Joel Semambo the General Manager, Barbra, Front Desk stuffs and the IT man who assisted with the safe box.\nThe only negative part of the Hotel were the security at the gate who are rude and act unprofessionally on how they handle people coming to visit, One of the evening my girlfriend came to visit , she was harassed because she only had a copy of the ID not the Original even when I went to talk to them personally they couldn't listen but rather acted to so rude until I had to request the General Manager Joel to intervene whom I credit for handling it professionally but however this couldn't change the feeling and the experience. I advise the Hotel management to specifically brief and train if possible their security personnel on how to deal with guests staying with them.\nOtherwise besides that the stay was great, value for money,amazing service and one of the best Hotel to stay in around Kampala\nI look forward to staying there again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:40:37.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
