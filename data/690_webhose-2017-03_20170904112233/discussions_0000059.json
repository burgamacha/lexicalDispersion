We upgraded our room to the terrace on the 16 floor and were very happy . The terrace provided a great area and relax with a glass of wine each evening . The bathroom has a amazing Japanese automatic heated toilet and a rainfall shower . We want to copy this set up at home . The room also has electric blinds and a cappuccino and coffee maker . The massage chair is a nice feature and the mattress extremely comfortable. The hotel has great works of art by Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol and amazing sculptures. The hotel offered breakfast on the 16 floor . I thought the Asian buffet offerings were exceptional. They also have a menu offering French toast , eggs Benedict and many other favorites . The staff was amazing always so happy and helpful for you to enjoy your stay . This hotel exceeded all expectations and it would rank in my top 3 in the world . The value is exceptional ! Bravo Hotel Eclat !", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:08:31.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
