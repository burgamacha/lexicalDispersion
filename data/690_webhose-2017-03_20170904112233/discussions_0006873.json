My husband and I stayed here after a trip to Italy to extend our vacation by a couple days. From the moment we checked in until we left EVERYTHING was top notch. The employees are some of the best. The front staff greats you upon very return and the doorman have the best attitudes. You can tell they love their jobs. We stayed in a suite with a wonderful living room overlooking 57th Ave with a separate half bath and a spa full bath in the bedroom. Enjoy the rain shower and soaking tub.\nThe location was so perfect. Close to shopping, Central Park, and wonderful restaurants. Take a dip in the pool on the 25th floor. Can't wait to come back.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:20:43.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
