The location looked ideal, nearby the Arc de Triomphe and walking distance to the Champs-Elys√©es.\nThe entire experience, from beginning to end, was amazing. The service is exemplary, and I found the team particularly helpful in organizing dinner reservations, or confirming outings within Paris.\nThis restaurant does not have a restaurant for dinner, but a lovely breakfast is served every day. There is a wide variety of dining establishments close by. The bar service in the afternoons at the hotel is really special - being able to sip on champagne before heading out is a lovely treat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:49:53.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
