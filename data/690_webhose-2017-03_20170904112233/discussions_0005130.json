The small didn't bother us, any city hotel we have stayed in has been small. The important thing, the room was spotless. Housekeeping pops in every day to freshen up.\nStaff.\nI actually don't think I have come across any friendlier, helpful, happy staff. They are a credit to the hotel. Nothing is to much trouble. I would like to say the gentleman on reception all day Saturday/Sunday (unfortunately didn't get his name) was amazing.\nIf we were to visit Paris again we wouldn't hesitate to stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:26:12.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
