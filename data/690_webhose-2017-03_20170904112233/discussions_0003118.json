Large french doors open to a private balcony over the front of the hotel. Wonderful staff as expected of Shangri La.\nIt really is a spectacular hotel with corresponding sumptuous decor reflecting the classic building although not really to my taste, as I prefer the The Shard style.\nWould suit honeymooners and romantic couples. Great restaurant next door called Monsieur Bleu. Pricey breakfast even for Parisian standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:06:56.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
