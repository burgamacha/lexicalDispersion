The rooms were very comfortable, the hotel staff was wonderful, and our trip was made even more enjoyable by the great restaurant recommendations the concierge Antoine gave us. Dada, in short walking distance of the hotel, quickly became a favorite and one we visited several times as it was truly local cuisine. Also had an amazing dinner at the Italian restaurant just down the street. The cafe next door to the hotel was one we visited several times for dessert and was a nice option to the more expensive prices in the hotel. The location of the hotel was perfect, as the metro was a short walk up towards Arc de Triomphe. Champs-Elysees was a little longer walk but equally enjoyable to pass by the shops and eateries to more enjoy this beautiful city. Uber is available and was a great option for getting around the city. My only negative about the property was the daily breakfast buffet, which was part of our room package, was the same food everyday, however options were available to order off the menu. You will not be disappointed with this hotel and we'd definitely come back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:07:48.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
