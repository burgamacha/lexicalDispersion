The lobby and common areas smell divine! Its their white tea fragrance which you also can purchase from the spa! We had a stunning view from the room! We could see the Louvre,eiffel tower,Notre dam and the river! The breakfast was a bit disappointing! Very limited fresh hot selections for vegetarians! Not very prompt service! The concierge and front desk however were very courteous and friendly! Overall a good experience except for the breakfast!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:17:04.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
