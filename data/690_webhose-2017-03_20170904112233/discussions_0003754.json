We were thrilled with our room and the view as it was on the 5th floor and I could even see the Eiffel Tower and watch it light up at night! That was a real treat! Because this is a hostel/hotel I was concerned that there would be noise from the hostel guests but not at all.\nThe breakfast was sufficient to fuel us for a long day, although the breakfast room is a bit tight, so I would recommend getting in and out early. The elevator up to the 5th floor is also veeeery slow but for us that added to the charm of the old building.\nThe bathroom is our room was clean and neat and as mentioned our views were just stunning. Looking down in the bustling city street of Paris was an experience of a lifetime. We were also quite happy to be out of Paris central as we got to explore more off the beaten path. We felt perfectly safe walking at night. There is also a lovely little cafe on the corner next to the hotel where we enjoyed drinks and a superette a few meters up the road.\nThe hotel is a short walk to two different metro stations making it easily accessible.\nThe staff were really lovely and helpful as well. We will definitely be back!! :-)\nRoom Tip: 5th floor!
