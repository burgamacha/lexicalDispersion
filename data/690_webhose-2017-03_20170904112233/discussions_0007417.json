We stayed 2 nights at the weekend while we explored the galleries and boutiques. We found the hotel ideally located, a short walk from the Louvre, and perfect for our needs. We did not spend very much time at the hotel but the room was comfortable for the three of us with 3 single beds and it was clean and well appointed, traditionally furnished which was exactly what we wanted. The breakfast was great, not a vast menu but far more than we required. Highly recommend this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:29:20.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
