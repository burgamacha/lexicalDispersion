Bed was very comfortable.\nBreakfast buffet was plentiful and tasty, the friendly staff replacing food and topping up the drinks regularly, the only slight downside was the small area which served as the breakfast room, however we never had to wait for a table.\nAll the staff that we encountered were very friendly and ready to offer advice when we asked, Dahmane in particular.\nWe will definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a base from which to explore Paris..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:25:47.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
