We knew this hotel wouldn't be up to their standard but was pleasantly surprised.\nI have to say this place is up there with the top 10 on trip advisor and the staff do their very best to be as helpful and courteous as they can.\nWe've nothing bad to say about this place and if you want a decent hotel in the west end right next to Chinatown then this is the one for you. The entrance foyer is quite small and only one little lift but don't let that put you off even if it gets a bit congested. Breakfast next door was excellent too. Thanks for your great hospitality and keep up the good work.\nRoom Tip: Front of hotel can be a tad noisy if police are flying by.
