Location is fantastic, one of my favourite bits of the city and very close to the subway. First room we had - issue with smell in bathroom. Eventually rectified. Then an unwanted visitor in the bath (think it came in via shower). Eventually got moved to a suite on the 9th floor, not majorly better in terms of room quality, apart from some marginally upgrades and larger bathroom, but a generous gesture and much appreciated. My second stay at the hotel and would visit again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:03:08.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
