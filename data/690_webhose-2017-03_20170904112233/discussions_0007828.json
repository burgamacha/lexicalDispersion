Ignore the terrible reviews, they are probably from people expecting 5*. This is a clean, welcoming and well placed hotel. Hanger Lane tube is a short walk away, use the tube (Central line)to get into the city.\nThere's a shop 3 units up ( Next to the post office) which sells water, snacks, beer etc at good prices. EG Large 2 litre Evian Â£1! Not usual London rip off. Breakfast was great. Our room sat next to the very busy road but due to the insulation we didn't hear much noise at all. Highly recommended for a break in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:45:45.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
