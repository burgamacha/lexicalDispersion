To prepare for the audition, she need to practice piano while in New York. Being the first time in New York, we did not know where to find a place to practice piano. I wrote an e-mail to New York Hilton Midtown and asked if there is any chance that she can practice piano in the Hotel. And guess what, I got a reply from the director of the Hotel and he offered a good place in the Hotel for my daughter to practice piano, and it was free! Plus the hotel also upgraded their room for free. The audition went well and my daughter had a wonderful stay in New York Hilton Midtown. I must thank them for their generosity and kind consideration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:53:19.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
