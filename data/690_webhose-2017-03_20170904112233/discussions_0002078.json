But although it was a perfectly nice room (classic style), on the 4th floor, it was very small and looked onto a tiny inner courtyard and I felt quite claustrophobic. The staff were very helpful, and moved us to an even nicer (very modern) room on the 1st floor. The window opened onto the main street, but unlike other reviewers, I didn't find it noisy at all. We were in Room 28 on the 1st floor. The location is fantastic, it really cannot be faulted. Just minutes from the Colosseum. We walked everywhere without any problems. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, as it was excellent value for money, and the staff were extremely helpful.\nRoom Tip: First floor, Room 28 was modern and spacious. Opens onto the main street. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:03:45.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
