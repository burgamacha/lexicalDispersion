The hotel is clean, modern and stylish...Rooms are well decorated and comfortable...The hotel staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble from booking restaurants, booking taxi's and offering advice about your stay in Rome. We stayed for a quick weekend break (1 night) and I would definitely return when next in Rome. Due to the short nature of our stay we didn't get to use the Spa facilities but they looked really lovely. Breakfast was great, again we had first class service and the staff were attentive offering coffee and freshly baked bread/pastries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:31:41.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
