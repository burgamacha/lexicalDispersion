The location is perfect, a half block off Times Square and yet quiet. The rooms are decently sized and extremely comfortable, with wonderful large bathrooms with tubs. Really nice extras such as the continental breakfast, coffee/tea availability all day, and wine and hors d'oeuvres available during the evening (all free of course). But the best part of the stay was the staff. Everyone we met, from the front desk, to the concierge, to housekeeping, to the attendants in the guest lounge was friendly, warm, and amiable. I really can't think of a reason to stay anywhere else while in New York!\nRoom Tip: Stay in the back for the quietest rooms.
