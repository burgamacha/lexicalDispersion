It's quite a small hotel and only has 6 levels but didn't make any difference. Most the theme of the hotels is black and white and it seemed a very clean place (Always saw people cleaning). The staff at reception were very welcoming and helpful and they even give you a free map of Paris. If you want to know any places to go or eat they would be more than okay to help you. The metro station is right beside it which is good because can travel to any of the popular places for about 1.90â‚¬ single fare. We stayed on the 6th level which had a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was on the small side but still nice. Decent size shower etc. There was a mini bar there and a coffee machine . Sorry tea lovers ! The Eiffel Tower is about 20mins walk away too. Not to sure what the food is like though. Would go back as all the staff were very well mannered and lovely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:24:15.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
