It was equipped with a nespresso machine and a couple of capsules to start your day. It had a variety of shows/movies on tv. Mini bar had a good variety.\nRoom service was really a disappointment, long waiting times and not very tasty either. My partner and I couldn't consume any of food, it tasted horrible and couldn't bring ourselves to eat it despite our raging hunger. The only thing we found edible was the chocolate mousse. Didn't order room service for the rest of our stay.\nWhat save the day was the location. Your as close to the Eiffel tower as one could dream. It was magical each time we arrived back to the hotel when we went touring.\nIt was also close to the train station, which was easy to catch the train to Disneyland and generic tourist sites.\nThe service was above average and the staff was pleasant to deal with. They also assisted with dinner arrangements too which was a great help.\nOverall I would definitely stay here again and bonus that it is part of the Accor program too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:00:31.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
