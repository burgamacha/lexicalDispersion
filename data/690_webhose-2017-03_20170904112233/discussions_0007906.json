Save on all that overcrowding on the DLR. the Hotel itself is ok. It needs bringing up to standard of the New Premier Inn Hotels, the bed was comfortable but not like the new ones. I requested a quiet room but was put in the 1st room by the lift on the 4th floor facing the DLR was a little noisy, ok sleep though.\nThe food was as you would expect at Premier Inn, Pub style.\nBreakfast was good an hearty, but PLEASE change your sausages, some with meat in would be good, it was like eating fluff!! Would stay again just for the location. Other restaurants around in close proximity. The Chinese 2 minutes walk away was excellent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:38:03.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
