My Platinum status gave me more benefits at this hotel. The hotel was also very thoughtful about which type of room I might prefer. The Club Lounge was small but it has a fabulous and spacious patio on the 21st floor.\nMy room was large (uncommon in NYC) and I used the fitness center every morning. I am in NYC frequently for work and had been trending on staying in a different hotel each time. After this stay it is highly likely that I will try to book here for all future stays in NYC because I had a very special room that I will not divulge here since there aren't many of them. I also could have walked to/from all of my meetings in Lower Manhattan had it not been raining.\nThe hotel is super close to the 1, A, C, E, and the 6 subway lines all along Canal so it is very easy to transfer underground from Penn Station. The location also is easy to get to via the Brooklyn or Manhattan Bridges if coming into LGA or JFK airports via Queens/Brooklyn.\nI spend on average half of every year in hotels for work and I very highly recommend this hotel.
