Ancient, authentic Chinese Couryard experience, with just 4 beautifully appointed rooms, with world class service! It even comes replete with a 3* Michelin Chef!\nService is charmingly personalized.\nOnly problem we had was with the transportation. Taxi's have never heard of this place, and since it is in a very narrow location, they don't want to take guests there. Due to the language problem, it is best to engage a Taxi for the duration of your stay!\nRoom Tip: Ask for the larger room. West room is a little small.
