I wanted to send something to his room to surprise him on his special day. I called and Dominque went above and beyond to help me. I have never had a hotel employee be so kind and accommodating. She went and got balloons and his favorite vodka and created a cool little set up. He was over the moon and so surprised. She even sent me a picture when it was all done.\nMy girlfriend said that this was the way they were treated the whole time and that she would never stay anywhere but the Eventi when they went to New York. We are looking to book again in the next 3 months\nThank you so much! Love from Texas!!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:29:30.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
