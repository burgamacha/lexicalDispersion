The welcome could not have been more friendly. We were offered coffee the moment we walked through the door. We were also upgraded to superior room, which was a bonus. Room was clean and comfortable. Location is very good, just 200 m from Moulin Rouge and Blanche metro station. Monmartre on your doorstep.\nAll staff, incl kitchen staff and cleaners were super friendly and very genuine. They weren't just going through the motions, they were really keen to help. There is coffee and cake in the lobby all day and you can help yourself as much as you want. Brilliant after a day exploring. Will try to stay here again next time. Highly recommended.\nRoom Tip: Room on the back very quiet, even with window open.
