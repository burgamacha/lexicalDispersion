It's close to transport (Grand Central), Times Square, 5th Ave, yet just far enough removed to be a little bit quieter. The library theme works really well, with books surrounding you wherever you go in the hotel. The wine and cheese offered each afternoon is a great touch. Staff are incredibly helpful, and will go out of their way to engage with guests and ensure they have a good stay. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:35:08.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
