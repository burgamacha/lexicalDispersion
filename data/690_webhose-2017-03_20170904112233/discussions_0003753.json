This four-star hotel in a charming 17th century building offers luxury at an affordable price. The beds are super comfortable with fine linens, and the bathroom, although compact, includes an excellent shower and bath, plush towels and robes, and L'occitane products. Rooms are immaculate, with excellent heating and A/C units.\nIsabelle, the weekday manager, is a delight, always pleasant and eager to help. When our flight into Paris was impacted by an Air France strike, she easily adjusted our reservation and pick-up at the airport.\nThe breakfast buffet in the downstairs \"cave\" level offers lots of choices and is well worth the additional fee. The hotel's central location is perfect, and each guest is now supplied with a cell phone for taxi service and international calling.\nThe living room off the reception area is a cozy space to read.\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Hotel Verneuil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:16:32.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
