It's on a quiet street with a few other hotels but is the best of the bunch by some margin in my opinion. The Odeon metro is a few minutes away and there are loads of bars, brasseries and restaurants in the neighbourhood which offer food and drink at all hours of the day and night. Our room was surprisingly spacious and was very comfortable and clean with no external or internal noise in evidence. The staff on the front desk were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. There is a small breakfast room on the ground floor that we haven't used because we prefer to go to a local bar or cafe for breakfast. The River Seine is only about 5-10 minutes walk away but our favourite local destination is the 20 minute walk past the Pantheon to rue Mouffetard which is a great little shopping street with some excellent eateries and food shops of all kinds. The cheese shops look particularly inviting as did the chickens on rotisseries dripping hot fat on to stacks of potatoes (apologies to any vegetarians reading this!). We really like this hotel for its tranquil atmosphere, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and excellent location at a reasonable price. What more could a visitor to France's capital city ask for?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:03:15.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
