You can't ask for a better location, a half block from Times Square with entry from either 42nd or 41st. The lobby is actually on the 21st floor so you are guaranteed a view of the city. The rooms we've had were very nice and well equipped. The staff at the hotel are great, they really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Next time your planning a trip to the city I would definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:45:14.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
