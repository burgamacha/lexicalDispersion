We arrived at 5:30pm and was greeted by Gustavo at the front desk. He went out of his way to accommodate my party of 9 family members. Warm cookies were given to all. Beds were comfortable, and the couch pullout was surprisingly comfy as well. Did not feel any bars at all. I asked for an extra pad for the pullout, which I assume helped. Bathroom was large enough to accommodate us 6 ladies. Ask for a high floor. We were on the 41st and did not hear any traffic or sirens. Breakfast was excellent! We had our omlettes, pancakes, waffles, french toast made to order. Fresh fruit, pastries, toast, bacon, sausage, cereal, scrambled eggs, juices, even a couple Chinese options were available too. Hanna and the Ginger's staff were superb! We were treated like royalty and our coffee and juice cups were always filled. I always look forward to seeing Hanna's smile in the morning. I also want to give kuddos to the housekeeping staff. Our room was cleaned daily and the ladies always asked us if we needed extra towels, etc. Amarones restaurant on 9th Ave, and Havana Cafe on 48th St are amazing places to eat and walking distance. I have a choice to stay anywhere in NYC, but I wouldn't think twice about staying anywhere other than the Doubletree! Hilda, the Hotel Manager, has a wonderful staff! Please don't ever change!\nRoom Tip: High floor.
