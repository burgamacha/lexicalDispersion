Hotel itself was very well presented, well decorated and the rooms are great with a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and toaster supplied if you wanted breakfast in your room. Beds were very comfortable, plenty of room to move around the room. Lifts were a little busy at times and only had to wait a few minutes for one to bring us down from the 18th Floor. The hotel staff were excellent, always friendly, ready to give advice and directions and a special mention has to go to the hotel concierge Amanda, who was a ray of sunshine every time we saw her, greeting us, asking how are day was or what we were doing that day.\nRoom Tip: the higher the room, the less the noise and better views See more room tips Green Features: different bins for trash and recyclables, energy saving bulbs, option to not have towels and sheets changed every day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:30:36.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
