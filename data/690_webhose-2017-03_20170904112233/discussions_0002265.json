There's always people to talk to in the common room and find company for drinks or dinner or adventures. Every day.\nThe dorms are clean and comfortable.\nThe one and only complaint is that the only toilets are downstairs via the common room.\nThe location is also amazing. Supermarket next door and some of the best value dining and shopping in all of beijing all in the 600 year old Dashilar area. It's like walking out on a movie set everyday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:01:52.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
