Breakfast was appreciated each morning as well as an \"honor\" bar and coffee station for evenings. Rooms are currently being updated, I stayed in 2 different rooms one which was recently painted and wallpapered the other one not but both were very accomodating and clean. Bed was slightly larger in the \"updated\" room. Street traffic was not an issue as windows were well insulated. Small snacks and drinks in the room for a fee.\nA couple of little eateries were across the street and next door otherwise walking was not an issue to some of the best bistro's and restaurants. Neighborhood felt safe and within 1/4 mile to Champs and shopping galore.\nFront desk was very friendly and helped with directions, taxi's and anything else I needed. Definatly will stay here again for both business and pleasure.\nRoom Tip: Updated rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:54:11.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
