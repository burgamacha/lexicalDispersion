The rooms are immaculate and luxurious and the location is fabulous. We spent each breakfast on the roof terrace looking out over Rome enjoying the fresh croissants, pancakes, meats, cheeses, smoked salmon and eggs. Barbara and Valentina could not have been more considerate and nothing was too much trouble for them. In the evening Franchesco again made our visit so special and introduced us to some amazing wine and Alex was always there to help us with any questions.\nThere is nothing bad we can say about this hotel and all of the staff take huge pride in making your stay comfortable, memorable and magical.\nReally, really well done. Can't wait to come back\nRoom Tip: Some rooms are in a building opposite but it's not a problem See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:30:14.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
