Our suite was clean and quiet, and we got a good night's sleep. Everything in our suite was in proper working order. The evening reception was outstanding, with Greek gyros sandwiches, yogurt sauce, pita bread, hummus, Greek salad, hearty soup, red and white wine, beer, pink lemonade, iced tea, and apples. As we finished dinner, the hotel put out some freshly-baked oatmeal raisin cookies. For breakfast, there were scrambled eggs with cheese and mushrooms, French toast sticks, sausages, bananas, peanut butter, strawberry yogurt, cereal, pastries, toast, orange juice, and apple juice. This hotel had everything for our travel needs. There is a free airport shuttle that runs frequently, and the hotel is located near beautiful walking trails along the SF Bay. There is ample complimentary parking, and the hotel is located in a safe area. The staff were helpful, courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. Digital check-in was smooth and efficient; it was reassuring to have pre-selected a room in case of late arrival. I received my Diamond amenity of bottled water. We have stayed at this hotel two years ago, also in a 2BR/2BA suite, and our experiences both times were excellent. We noticed that the hotel has done some renovations since our last stay.
