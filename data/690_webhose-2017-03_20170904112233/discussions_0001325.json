Number One is the helpful and cordial staff, every one of whom goes out of the way to make us welcome and happy. This time, for example, we arrived in mid-morning, weary from an overnight flight, to find our room available for much needed naps and showers. The next day we received perfect advice about the mos efficient way to travel to an art exhibit at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. Similarly, the hotel suggested and made all arrangements for us to make an early-morning flight to Spain on the day we departed. And as always, our room was quiet and comfortable.\nRoom Tip: All of the rooms are quiet, but the ones that face onto the inner courtyard are particularly so.
