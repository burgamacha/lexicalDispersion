The staff is friendly and very helpful. The rooms are well appointed, with good storage and the beds are very comfortable. The spa facilities are a great luxury, and will help you to relax and get over jet lag, or soothe your tired feet after a busy day in Paris. The location is prefect for shopping, sightseeing, museums or strolling along the Seine or the Tuileries Gardens. We always look forward to our next stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:13:51.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
