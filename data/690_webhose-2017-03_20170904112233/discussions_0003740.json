It was a few minutes walk to the Louvre and easy to catch a cab outside for further destinations. We arrived via car which was a little tricky just because of all the one way streets and lack of street parking. However, we were able to find a spot to unload our bags and then move the car to the parking lot. It is a public lot 2 streets over but the hotel contracts with them to give you a discounted price.\nCheck in was a breeze and the lady at the desk was very warm and helpful. The lift is very tiny so we had to make 2 trips with our luggage. The decor is dated but in a good and unique way. Our bed comforters were magenta but we really like the ambiance. We had a triple room and it was on the smaller side (but so are most European hotel rooms). The bathroom was a good size though and plenty of toiletries.\nThe breakfast buffet selection was pretty limited and if you want eggs - it costs extra. They were able to hold onto our bags after we checked out. We picked them up much later without any problem. All in all, it was a pleasant stay for our one night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:41:34.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
