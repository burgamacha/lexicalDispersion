The view towards East London was a real plus. Housekeeping did a great job throughout the duration of our 4 day stay.\nMinor concerns at front desk as they did not answer to our requirements, lacked professionalism and show little consideration overall.\nLocation was absolutely perfect. It is an easy and pleasant walk to the west end. Jubilee line was less than 5 min. walk from the hotel.\nWould happily stay here again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:49:28.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
