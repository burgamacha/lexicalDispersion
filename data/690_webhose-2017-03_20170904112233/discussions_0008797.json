The meetings also took place within the hotel. From start to finish you realise how iconic and luxurious this hotel is. The team were nothing but polite and courteous and the amenities were also more than enough. I had a top floor room overlooking the museum and this was perfect for me. The bed was comfortable and the room cleaned each day thoroughly.\nThe gym, whilst small, has more than most hotels with a mixture of resistance machines and cardio equipment.\nThe breakfast and food provided was lovely.\nThank you for a memorable stay.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:45:16.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
