The situation, just off Cromwell Road was ideal, being an easy walk to Earls Court tube station. Our executive double room on the fourth floor was spacious and overlooked the street. The windows are not double glazed so I did hear a little noise in the early hours but nothing excessive, and no noise at all from fellow guests. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. We were a little disappointed with the cold breakfast. It is quite expensive and we have had better but there was enough to fill us up for a few hours' sightseeing. There is a Sainsbury's supermarket just around the corner for a DIY packed lunch. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and we would recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:11:02.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
