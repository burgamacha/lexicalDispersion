We were thrilled with the small hotel, the level of service, the breakfast, the location, and the facilities. We enjoyed breakfast daily and the staff was very accommodating of our large group and our schedules. After touring the city all day the beautiful roof deck was the perfect place to relax with a glass of Prosecco or in the hot tub. We also enjoyed cocktail hour by the fire before setting out for dinner in the city each night. The hotel is beautiful, staff warm and accommodating, and the location excellent for walking throughout the city but quiet enough for sleeping. The rooms are beautifully appointed, large, with large luxurious baths, especially for Rome. We would highly recommend Villa Spalletti Trivelli and will return.\nRoom Tip: All of the rooms were wonderful.
