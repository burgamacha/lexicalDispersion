I'd stay here again.\nIt is around a 5-7 min walk to gloucs rd tube station but not a lot going on around the hotel which was fine for us, traffic noise was ok considering it's right on the Cromwell road.\nThe staff we saw were all super friendly and couldn't do enough for you particularly the doorman.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:16:18.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
