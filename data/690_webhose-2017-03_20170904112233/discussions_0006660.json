I work in Fashion, so have often stayed here during fashion weeks in Paris. This is an old, traditional Parisian hotels so don't expect new decor, fancy coffee machines in rooms or swanky new fittings etc. It's an old school 4* hotel with dated decor but well spaced rooms, roomy bathrooms with bathtubs and great mattresses. Plus the rooms face indoors and are quite. The staff is very friendly and the scrambled eggs are delish!\nRoom Tip: I always go for an inward facing room on the higher floors, away from the lift.
