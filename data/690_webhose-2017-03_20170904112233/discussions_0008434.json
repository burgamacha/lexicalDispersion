The double bed was comfortable, just a tad cramped for two middle-aged humans, but cozy. The bathroom was bright and cheery with a huge window and a claw foot tub. Every convenience was available from a small safe, desk to work at, and a decent t.v. The full English breakfast that was included in the hotel price was amazing with scrambled eggs, baked beans, sausages, tomatoes, toast, coffee, and fruit. This was by far the best deal around as far as price, amenities included, clean atmosphere, and very friendly staff! The Paddington Train Station was within walking distance of the hotel. Best vacation in London yet!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room that faces the main entrance street.
