Only drawback was no tea or coffee in the room. This was an extra cost if you wanted it. The breakfast was good and the coffee served was spot on. The staff were very helpful and would help with directions. The location is good if you like walking, The Collosium is about 20mins. To get further afield the Metro and Busses run from The termini. Would stay here again.\nRoom Tip: The lifts are a bit small, but the stairs are hard work if you are on floor 4 or 5 See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:13:27.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
