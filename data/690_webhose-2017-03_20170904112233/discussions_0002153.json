This hotel has been my go to hotel meaning my home away from home. For many many years. I love the location in the lower east side. It's go that neighborhood vibe which is great for a busy city. I also love the new restaurant and bar downstairs and the remodel\nOf the lobby area. The rooms are larger than anyone else in this neighborhood. You can stay at the so called Trendy Ludlow hotel but the rooms their are so dinky that I bashed my knee against the bed trying to get to the bathroom and then their bathroom was another disaster as to sit in the toilet I had to close the bathroom door as the bathroom was so tiny and also to get in the shower was difficult. At the Rivington the rooms are big so you don't have that problem so when staying in the lower east side you must choose the Rivington hotel they also have the best views so make sure and request a room on a high floor so that you can soak up this beautiful city! Thank you hotel on Rivington staff for always going out of your way to ensure I have such a warm welcome you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:16:18.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
