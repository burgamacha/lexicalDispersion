The rooms were clean and well equipped and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The guys in reception were really helpful - even though it was very busy - Neil especially so. Other members of staff were polite and friendly. The breakfast was a little disappointing - there was only a combination of scrambled egg, beans, bacon and sausage and the quality was not very good. The location was ideal for us for walking to Stamford Bridge - 20 minute walk, and the nearest underground station at West Kensington was just a 10 minute walk. Overall a nice stay - if only the breakfast was better it would have been great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:47:21.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
