This is the place to stay.\nWhat a gem! We had a short but truly wonderful stay. The rooms are beautifully clean and exquisite, and the morning breakfasts are something to boast about! From a friendly conversation with the owner to delicious coffee, fresh-out-the-oven baked goods, fruits, cereal, hot plate eggs and bacon...you name it!\nThe owners take pride in treating their guests like family and it is immediately felt. Thank you to all the friendly staff as well for going the extra mile, superb service! A must for any Stellenbosch travel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:05:03.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
