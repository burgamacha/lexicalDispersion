We were 3 persons and there was enough room for us all. ( a sofabed and a double bed)The bathroom looked brand new and was very clean. Also, the room overlooked Maiden Lane and you could see Broadway from it- still, it was nice and quiet - nothing fancy but everything we needed. The location is just absolutely perfect. Fulton street subway station just next door and lots of restaurants& shopping close by. Only a few minutes' walk from Wall street and about 10 minutes from Battery park. Easy Access from and to the airport with Airtrain& A-train.\nThe breakfast room was a bit crowded at times but all in all we were happy. In NYC,it is a bonus to have breakfast included in the price.\nWould stay here again and can recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced hotel in a good location.\nRoom Tip: Upper floor, less noise.
