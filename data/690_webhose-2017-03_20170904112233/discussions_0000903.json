Every single interaction felt personalised and sincere, and the hotel is full of delightful little touches like Berocca in the mini-bar just in case you accidentally have one or four too many of their amazing martinis.\nWe were only there one night and treated the hotel like a little oasis of calm and luxury, especially the hotel bar which was so cool that it made me wish I'd brought my slippers (they do give you slippers, and they're comfy, but nothing rivals your own slippers). We slept like sleepy logs that night, easily the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel for a number of years.\nOh, and there's a TV in the bathroom.
