A short walk to Temple of Heaven, Tianimian square, Forbidden City and Wanfujing Street and the subway.\nThe service and cheerful nature of all at The Residence Club led by Sally, and in particular Steven, Hannah, Leona and Cornelia who we had several dealings with were most appreciated. Nothing was too much trouble and their service and attitude was outstanding.\nAn excellent breakfast selection. We dined at the large lobby buffet as well as The Residence Club and both provided an endless selection of food offerings, all fresh and well presented.\nI loved this hotel with its spacious rooms, wonderfully appointed bathroom, amenities and comfortable bed. I will be returning in November with my husband and look forward to seeing you all again then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:24:04.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
