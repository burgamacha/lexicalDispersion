I booked this hotel specifically for their view of their airport. I'm a local but for my son's birthday, I decided to book a couple of rooms here in honor of his 6th birthday. He is obsessed with airplanes, so I booked a suite and another room with two double beds with a clear view of the landing area and the airport. I also made sure to book the rooms with the M lounge access so we can grab drinks/coffee and have breakfast in the morning.\nPros about the hotel:\n- Great for business travelers and families.\n- Wonderful M Lounge for those who are platinum Marriott card members. You can also book rooms specifically with M lounge access on the site.\n- Beautiful views of the Airport and waterfront. If you love airplanes, it's a wonderful place to watch the planes take off and land. The view is absolutely amazing.\n- Service from most of the employees are great\n- Fun candy bar right next to check in and a cute treasure chest where kids can grab a little treat. My son and his cousins loved going here and grabbing a toy. It was one of the highlights of our trip.\n- Fun indoor pool\n- Nice restaurants: Flight 101 and Hangar steak\n- Shuttle to and from airport as well as the Burlingame shopping district.\nCons:\n- The floors at the indoor pool was incredibly slippery. My son slipped twice and his younger cousin slipped once. They weren't even running. I'm just happy my son was wearing a life jacket because it broke his fall. Otherwise, it would have been a different story because he fell pretty bad. Hotel Manager - PLEASE consider putting some rubber mats around the pool or at least less slippery tiles. The tiles you have are incredibly slippery.\n- Although the majority of the employees were great, we encountered one at the M lounge who was VERY rude. Not only to our party, but I also witnessed her being rude to other patrons. It was disappointing to witness this because we rarely encounter rude employees at Marriott properties. Whatever - we didn't let her ruin our stay.\nI definitely recommend this hotel. It's a great place. The view alone is worth it! I can't wait to return.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:27:19.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
