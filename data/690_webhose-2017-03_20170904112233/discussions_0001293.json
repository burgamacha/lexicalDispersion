I was so pleasantly surprised by the EVEN hotel. It's a really fun concept, focused on being healthy while traveling. So the cafe serves nice healthy food, there's a great gym and some of the rooms even have exercise equipment like a fit ball, yoga mat and TRX. The rooms are pretty big for NYC and super clean. The beds are so comfortable and I was lucky to have a beautiful view of the Chrysler Building!!! Midtown is definitely convenient for getting around and most touristy things are walking distance from this hotel. They staff are super friendly and helpful, especially by NYC standards. The wifi works really well and the room is ok for working, if you need to. The only negatives of this place are - the cafe is small and easily overwhelmed given how small it is versus how big the hotel is AND the lifts/elevators. This was a constant annoyance - with long waits in both directions. Pretty painful if ore in the higher floors and only one lift/elevator can access them. However, once the construction is finished, this issue should be resolved. Would highly recommend this fun hotel to all visitors and business travelers!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:15:58.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
