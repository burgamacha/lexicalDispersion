We ordered Parma pizza which came piled with arugula and shaved Parmesan cheese, and the deserts were amazing. Creme brûlée and gelato - Joe could you go wrong?! Will make this one of our regular visits. Despite being in the Renaissance Hotel, still feels like a high end neighborhood haunt. Highly recommend and am looking forward to sampling some of the other Italian dishes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:28:33.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
