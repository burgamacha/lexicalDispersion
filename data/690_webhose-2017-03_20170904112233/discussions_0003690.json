The room was immaculate and the bed incredibly comfortable. Yes the rooms are very small so if you need a room with lots of space this isn't for you, but if you're looking for cleanliness, comfort and fabulously friendly staff I would highly recommend.\nBreakfast is a mix of breads, waffles, cereals and sausage and egg patties.\nNearest tube is East Broadway and is 5 mins walk.\nIf you get chance ask to go on the roof top terrace.\nThe staff are so incredibly helpful, nothing was too much trouble...including ordering pizza (Thanks Stephanie!)\nTry and ask for a room away from the lift/stairwell as it can get a bit noisy. I was in 506 right by the lift.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:33:47.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
