Staff was unfailingly polite and helpful. Beds comfortable. The executive lounge was fine and the breakfast was good, coffee very good. My only beef is that the room was way too small for three guests, two adults and a teenager. There wasn't enough room for suitcases, the extra bed or three people. Just too small. The bathroom had no counter space and only one sink. The make up mirror was fixed for someone very short and as my daughter and I are tall(ish) it was useless. We were offered a suite at check in but it would have been an additional 200 euro per night so we declined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:15:53.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
