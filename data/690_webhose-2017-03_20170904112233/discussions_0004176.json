If you're in NY on business, you may want to check out first, what your needs are. The hotel is close to 6th Ave. and the media district, within 5 minutes from Microsoft or NY Times etc.; I don't recommend going there if you arrive or plan to leave by car; the rooms are quite alright, but I have to say, as I stayed twice within two weeks there and therefore had different rooms, the second one was worse than the first one. The room looked very tired, drawers not closing etc. Service isn't that great either, apart from front desk - they were all very friendly, helpful and very competent. The Bistro is not, neither friendly, nor helpful and totally not competent. Bottom Line: for the price you get a great hotel in an unbeatable location.\nRoom Tip: book online and take the Empire state view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:55:47.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
