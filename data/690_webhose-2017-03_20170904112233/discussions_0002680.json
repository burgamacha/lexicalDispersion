You walk into an eclectic and colorful lobby, filled with friendly people and a smiling staff. If you need any tips on where to go or what to do, there's a bright neon green concierge sign you can't miss.\nIn front of the lobby you can find a quirky restaurant called Salvation Taco, here you can enjoy breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late night drink. We unfortunately couldn't enjoy the rooftop because of the cold weather, but people say it's one of the best rooftop bars in New York City because of its views.\nThe rooms are small but it's all you need to refuel. The interiors have a modern yet warm style. There are two small stainless steel bedside tables and a black steel light on each side. There's a small TV if you want to watch cartoons in the morning or watch a movie before going to bed. The black wooden blinds are great for keeping the light out in the morning. The shower and toilet are both within a diffused glass room. It's a cozy place to sleep and recharge before heading out to explore the city.\nThe hotel is very well located, right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. If you're on a budget and want a cool design hotel, make sure to check this place out. Thanks Pod 39 for a very pleasant stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:08:19.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
