I was checked in by a lovely young lady sabina and a young man ifti they were both wonderful and efficient. They explained everything and encouraged me to buy breakfast and told me my kids can eat for free. The room was really clean and big with a view of the city. I called from the room in the evening asking if I could have more tea and sugar and it was sent to me immediately. Breakfast in the morning was quite busy but I could see the staff were trying their best to accommodate everyone, Lana in breakfast was really friendly. The food was excellent and nothing was missing from the buffet. We wanted to go shopping before checking out of the hotel and we're told by sabina that we could leave our bags until 11pm, which was fantastic. When checking out we asked what other views are available from the rooms because we wanted to come back for Mother's Day, we requested the olympic park view with interconnecting rooms.\nWe came back for Mother's Day and it was wonderful. The view was even better than the first time we stayed. The same standard was maintained by the staff and it was really nice to see sabina and Lana again. We will definitely be visiting again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:19:36.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
