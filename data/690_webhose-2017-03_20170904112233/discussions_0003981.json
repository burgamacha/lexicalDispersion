It is tough to find a decent hotel that is not exorbitantly priced in NYC but this hotel manages to provide both service and value. Staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms clean with enough basic amenities for a comfortable stay. Our room was on the 19th floor and we had fantastic views of the Empire State building. Despite its location, it was relatively quiet. The room was a bit small; if someone sat at the desk - you had a hard time getting by without hitting the bed but that is a very small detail. We walked to many places from this hotel (5th Avenue, The Highline etc.) and we so very pleased with its location. We will definitely stay here on our next visit!\nRoom Tip: We had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building from room 1907.
