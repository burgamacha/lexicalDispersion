Central to everything you need but not the noise and craziness of time square, we loved it. All of it, the super friendly staff, the ice bucket and corkscrew in the room, the ice machine located down the stairs which was wonderful for a cheeky pre dinner bottle of bubbles in the room, we felt safe walking back after dinner and drinks even in the early hours of the morning, great bar across the road, steak tartare was a winner.\nAlso, you can leave your bags/ cases in a locked room just off reception if you have a later flight, overall a fantastic hotel, we felt we had a five star New York hotel experience for a far lower price, highly recommend and thanks to all at the wolcott for making our stay so fabulous", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:04:41.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
