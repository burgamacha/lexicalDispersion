Room was amazing, huge balcony and great view. They upgraded our room for free upon arrival. The staff was excellent from the moment we entered the hotel, and nothing we asked for seemed to be a problem. One of the best things was this portable wifi. Being foreigners in Paris, this really helped us navigate our way from A to B throughout our visit. Another thing we loved was the soaps, and the scent that seemed to be \"the smell of the hotel\".. We actually asked what perfume it was, but apparently it's not perfume, haha!\nWe enjoyed our stay here so much that we are definitely coming back! Great value. Guess we just have to hope the prices stay as low in the future too", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:39:09.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
