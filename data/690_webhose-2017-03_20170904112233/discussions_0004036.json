The room was very clean and well organized with good lighting and adequate storage space. There was an easily accessible safe. Elevators were very efficient. The wine hour which is a signature of Kimpton properties is not as welcoming and enjoyable as in other Kimpton -- very little seating; dark; on 3rd floor rather than in the lobby. Lobby also seemed dark and a bit hectic compared to other Kimptons. Bed was very comfortable and the view of the Empire State Building was spectacular. Front desk was efficient but did not seem to have a concierge and no city maps available.\nRoom Tip: Ask for view of Empire State Building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:49:30.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
