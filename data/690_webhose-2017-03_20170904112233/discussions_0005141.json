The view over the vineyard towards the mountains is breathtaking and the inside decor and layout extremely tasteful. I was very impressed with the staff - from the lady who greeted me on arrival, to the gentleman who made me a delicious coffee, to the beauty therapist who indulged all my senses - they were all incredibly polite and professional. Thank you. Lanzerac Spa can be extremely proud of the facelift it underwent recently - it is quite simply gorgeous. There is a fantastic \"flow\" to the building and it has been well designed to cleverly let the light filter in at all the right places. I also felt that the spiral staircase added an elegant and understated grandeur to the place, and as I ascended, I almost felt as ifI was being transported to a \"magical, faraway realm\". I look forward to visiting again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:07:31.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
