Very accessible if you are planning to visit the Woodbury outlet or taking a shuttle from the airport. The staffs are really friendly like what everyone mentioned and sure is accommodating to our requests. The only complain would probably be the inconsistent hot-water from our shower and the poor elevators that takes ages to arrive during peak hours. Nonetheless, the amenities are great and we loved the kitchenette which came with a dish washer. Do wake up early for the generous servings at breakfast and drop by for the tea break if you are around the corner.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a high floor room with a view of empire state building See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:46:15.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
