It is conveniently located on Cromwell Road near the Gloucester Road tube stop (District, Circle, Piccadilly), restaurants, and convenience stores. It is a short walk to the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museums.\nMy room was ready upon arrival, and it was clean and comfortable. I slept well in the double bed (loved the duvet). The nice bath had a shower, plenty of towels and bathrobes. The room was equipped with a small refrigerator, hair dryer and safe. In addition to the initial stock of shampoo, soap and lotion, the housekeeping staff left something new each day such as bath salts and breath mints.\nMy reservation included a daily continental breakfast that featured an array of juice, fresh fruit, yogurt, cold meats and cheeses, pastries, and toast. For an additional fee, additional selections such as a full English and omelettes are available. The continental breakfast was enough for me to fuel up for a day of sightseeing in London.\nThe free wi-fi worked well. There is a flat screen TV in the room with an interesting selection of programming and movies. The hotel has a small lounge with a bar and Happy Hour specials.\nThe staff was friendly and extremely helpful.\nI am very happy with my stay at the Ashburn. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well situated hotel with modern amenities yet retains the charm of \"old London\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:13:54.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
