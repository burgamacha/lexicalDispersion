It's located in a really quiet area and next to a metro stop. It's far from the city centre but in metro that's not a big deal at all. The service was extremely kind and the breakfast very good. The room was really clean and comfy. The only thing that I could say but it's not bad at all, is that the bathroom is a bit old..but quite clean and works perfectly. It's just an aesthetic thing.. 100% recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:46:08.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
