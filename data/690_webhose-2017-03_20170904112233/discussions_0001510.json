The location is unbeatable: on beautiful and quiet Via Margutta yet just a minute or two from Piazza Spagna, which has taxi stands and a metro stop but also well-situated to walk to so many key sites. All of the staff were kind, friendly, and helpful. The reception made check in and check out easy and quickly dealt with any questions or requests we had; the breakfast was varied and delicious, with very friendly service; and the housekeeping was efficient and impeccable. They have a number of room types and sizes, so if space is important to you, book a larger room, as my mom and I did - we were not disappointed! Lots of space, nice d√©cor, excellent bathrooms and showers, very comfortable beds. No complaints whatsoever! We booked directly through the hotel's website and got great value for our money. Recommend wholeheartedly. Grazie mille!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:13:09.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
