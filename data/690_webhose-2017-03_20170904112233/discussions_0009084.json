We did not use public transportation until our 3rd day due to this. The hotel is very nice, has a great feel and wonderful staff. I didn't open a door to leave to come in or hail a taxi with the staff there. The concierge took care of our needs, including mailing post cards out for us. The only with the concierge was their accents as we are from the US. Bank restrarant was great.
