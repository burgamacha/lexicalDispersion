Room was small, but we did not need a lot of space and had all the amenities you would need, so I didn't mind. Very nice bathroom, all subway tiles and very clean. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to stay in that neighborhood, very close to the subway and staff were incredibly nice. Would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:16:28.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
