We stayed at Hotel Balmoral as we wanted a boutique style hotel and that is exactly what we got. It was the perfect balance of class and sophistication, while keeping the quant atmosphere we was seeking. The staff were faultless and Anne Claire was extremely helpful with all queries we had. I was a little nervous not knowing any French but the staff put us at ease straight away. The location was great, very central but also tucked away so we had a perfect nights sleep. The room was impeccable and the mattress was one of the comfiest I have slept on during a trip abroad. We loved the Art in the rooms and found the d√©cor extremely charming. When travelling we do not like to do the same thing twice, but we had the most amazing weekend and cannot wait to visit Paris again, we would definitely stay at Hotel Balmoral for our next visit and have already recommended to friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:34:48.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
