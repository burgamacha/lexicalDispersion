The location could not be better, you are right at the Tuileries and the Louvre, with Rue St. Honoré, the Palais Royal, Place Vendôme all around the corner. A Metro stop (Tuileries) is within short walking distance. I had a room on the sixth floor which was, in true Parisian fashion, quite petit (but with a big comfy king-size bed). The well-appointed bathroom was of fair size, with a rain shower, a big washbasin, nicely tiled, plush towels, nice toiletries. There are no coffee or tea making facilities in the room, but there is a nice little lounge on the mezzanine floor above reception offering a Nespresso machine and also an honesty bar. Breakfast is a small, but varied buffet in the basement. English speaking reception staff are super helpful. Given what nice hotel room in the 1er normally costs, almost a bargain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:12:45.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
