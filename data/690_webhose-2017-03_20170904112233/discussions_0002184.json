Walking distance to Eiffel and the arc de triumph. Metro close by and a bakery and pharmacy on every block. There is a mini store next door to hotel if you need and snacks or anything. We all loved this hotel so much. Was big enough for 5 people, got the 2 bedroom suite that included a kitchenette, living room, and 2 bathrooms. There was lots of room for all of us. Just a tip if you are so tired from site seeing and have kids and just need to pick up something quick, there is a pizza hut 2 blocks away and only 7 euro for a medium. Very helpful to us as we had hungry exhausted kids after a full day of site seeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:20:48.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
