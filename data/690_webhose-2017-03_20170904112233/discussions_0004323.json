The location, the view from the room, the decor, the service-all absolutely perfect! From the time of booking through our checkout process, it was an easy, pleasant experience. Sanjay (the concierge) is amazing, as well! He helped with recommendations and reservations and was so kind. I was looking for a true Parisian hotel in the perfect Parisian location, and this couldn't have exceeded my expectations more. We had a small room with a street view, and it was just perfect. I will send everyone I know who visits Paris to this hotel and will not even look for a different place when we go back! Couldn't recommend this place more!!\nRoom Tip: I would definitely choose a room with a street view, as it looks out the most perfect Parisian view!
