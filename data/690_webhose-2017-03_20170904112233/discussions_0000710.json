You can walk to most of the major sites and the tube is literally right in front Rooms were small as expected in London. They were very clean and modern. The service was outstanding! They went way over the top to make sure every detail of the stay was perfect. I really do not think there is a better hotel out there in the same price range. Only complaint would be that you can hear people next door and in the hallways. I am sure the building is very old and there is really nothing you can do about that. As far as getting to the hotel I flew in around 5:00pm and took the heathrow express to paddington then a 10 pound uber to the hotel. On the way back took an uber straight to heathrow 35 pounds 45 minutes (saturday at 1:00pm). I would pay the extra to cut the time off if you come in during rush hour otherwise uber is the best choice.\nRoom Tip: Not the 3rd floot See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:09:06.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
