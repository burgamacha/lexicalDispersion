This was the perfect antidote to the fantastic and amazing few days we previously spent in Cape Town! It is in a stunningly beautiful location. The hotel and bedrooms are plush and tastefully decorated, oozing character. The bedding and towels of the highest quality! We just loved the pool area and the private patio outside our room. Everything about this place is utterly laid back and relaxing, we wished we had been staying for longer! The evening meal was the highlight! Fantastic food and wine served by friendly, knowledgeable staff. All fab value for money in our view. Thanks to all, I recommend this hotel most highly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:32:45.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
