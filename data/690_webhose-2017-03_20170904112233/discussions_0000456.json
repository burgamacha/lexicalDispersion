All staff were so helpful. A small hotel but by Romes standards a modern comfortable hotel room with the added creature comforts of a safe, large shower, slippers, tea & coffee and complimentary soft drinks in your minibar perfect for the day ahead in Rome! Breakfast was, apart from the very high end European hotels (treble the price), one of the best I've had in a smaller city hotel. Breakfast was cereals, choice of breads, fruits, toast machine, freshly squeezed juice served to your table by friendly staff who were happy to make your choice of coffee, add to that scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. Location wise we were very happy just 5 mins to the Termini for rail bus and metro links including City Sightseeing hop on/off bus and the airport shuttle. We had a room at the back on floor 4, nice view of diocletian baths. Rooms were quiet as the hotel is located on a side street. In the vicinity are a couple of restaurants, gelato and corner shops for more choice central areas about 15-20 minutes walk Having inspected many hotels through work I can say this is the cleanest I've been to, the staff worked tirelessly to keep the hotel clean and it was appreciated. The lounge and bar areas are very small but functual! If I return to Rome this is where I'm staying again as the hotels of comparable price didn't offer the same standard or quiet location. There are of course more luxurious hotels in Rome however they come with a large price-tag and I felt this hotel was excellent value for the standard of bedroom.\nRoom Tip: Rooms on floor 4 at the back are quiet (apart from the church chimes) and look on to historic sites See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:29:26.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
