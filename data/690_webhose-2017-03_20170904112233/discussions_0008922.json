We chose the unlimited bubbles option and we spent near on 2 hrs enjoying the food the views and the bubbles, the staff were fantastic so please pass on my praise to the staff involved.\nThe price is great value for a stunning hotel similar locally at a lesser place with no views and no unlimited bubbles charge similar so we wil visit again for sure. Maybe when my numbers come in for lotto we could stay a night here.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:00:31.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
