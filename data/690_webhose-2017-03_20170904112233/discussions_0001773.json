The central part of Rome is small enough that it is possible to walk to the Spanish steps in 15 minutes and the Colosseum in about 45 minutes. The room we had was small but very clean and comfortable. The room was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet. There is a very nice bar area and the cocktails in the evening were excellent. Although there is no restaurant, the bar can provide sandwiches.\nThe staff were extremely helpful, and gave excellent advice about nearby restaurants.\nI would highly recommend to friends and family visiting Rome.\nRoom Tip: Rooms at the back of the hotel are quieter. The standard room is quite small. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:30:45.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
