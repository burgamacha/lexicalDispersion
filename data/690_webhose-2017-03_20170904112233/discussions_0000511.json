Only ten minutes drive from the airport, you can avoid Kampala traffic if scheduled for an early flight for your safari the next day.\nA great way to start your holiday with airport transfers (free one way, 10 USD return) and fantastic staff.\nThere is a lovely little pool to cool off in and a fabulous beach bar across the road. Rooms are spacious and clean and ours had a view of both the pool and lake, which was perfect to catch the late afternoon sun on the balcony while being entertained by vervet monkeys.\nFood and drink is good with excellent service.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:20:31.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
