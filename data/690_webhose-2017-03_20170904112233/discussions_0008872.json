The staff has been kind and considerate and my rooms have always been lovely. Last time there, I sat in the lounge and was about to order a glass of wine when the wait staff remembered I liked rose...and brought it on her own. Nice touch.\nI was offered an upgrade when I arrived as well, as the room was not quite ready when I checked in... very kind indeed. A beautiful room, well appointed and luxurious.\nThank you Pelham... you are tops on this American girl's list! :-)\nRoom Tip: Prefer higher floor.
