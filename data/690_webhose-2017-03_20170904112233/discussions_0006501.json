The room was spacious enough with some lovely little details such as the Bowery Bear (we really regret not purchasing one to bring home) the old fashioned bathroom with the super warm and powerful shower, and the old paned windows that framed photos of the city beautifully,\nWe had a great time in the evenings relaxing by the fire in the bar and chatting with the bar staff who are the life and soul of the party! We even saw Adam Levine in there one evening, we hear The Bowery is quite the celebrity haunt!\nThe location is ideal for exploring SoHo and surrounding areas, it's also an awesome spot to check out all the great food places in the area.\nOverall if you're looking for a quirky boutique hotel with that 5* service you would get in a well known chain, this is the hotel for you. I will be recommending it over and over again to anyone travelling to New York to explore the city.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room facing the Financial district See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:11:41.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
