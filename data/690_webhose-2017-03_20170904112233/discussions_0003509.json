We booked as a family with 3 years old and a toddler and requested for our room to be prepared before our arrival as we have a baby and long drive and they granted our request, we are fortunate to have a nice view of the river in our room and of course front desk are very kind and helpful and catering at breakfast as well. Breakfast has a descent choices in my opinion (forget bacon and egg) of cheese and salami, and pressed orange for breakfast , perfect breakfast for our family , i love their l french croissant (yummy) and toasted bread for our family its like at home breakfast which makes it easier for me to feed my kids. I already recommend this place to family and friends who are coming to Paris. Great experience! Keep up the good work we will see you in our next visit and hoping for the same service again!\nRoom Tip: Corner suites have a nice view of the river See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:25:03.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
