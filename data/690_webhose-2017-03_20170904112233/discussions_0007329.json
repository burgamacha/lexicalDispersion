Our flight was delayed so we did not check in until midnight. The desk clerk cheerfully greeted us and got us settled in very quickly. The rooms were antique and pretty, very clean, with bidets in restroom. The breakfast was substantial and delicious. The desk staff helped us with tour reservations, general info, and airport transportation. It was almost as if we were their only guests! I felt like we were at a bed and breakfast inn. What a great value!\nRoom Tip: Perhaps ask for a room on the back side of hotel. The street noise in the early morning was loud.
