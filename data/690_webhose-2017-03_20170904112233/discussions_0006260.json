It has great amenities including pools, saunas, steam rooms, a world class gym, the friendliest staff and great food!\nI'm Canadian and it felt like I was in Vancouver Island in the summer. The drinks kept coming and I was in paradise for a great price.\nI was stunned to know that this was one of Uganda's first hotels during Idi Amin's regime. How interesting! The historical significance and the way they set their rooms according to geographical location was super creative.\nWith two craft market shops and the Kahawa corner coffee shop, I bought all sorts of African articles sipping on a beautifully made Latte.\nI will definitely be at this hotel again. Anyone that goes to Africa, please do at least visit the place!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:22:53.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
