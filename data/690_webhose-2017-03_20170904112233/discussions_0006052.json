We stayed at the lovely penthouse suite with two bautiful terasses, one big with a nice view over Romes roof tops, and a smaller with a great view of downtown Rome and even the St Peters basilica!\nMany of our favorite restaurants is nearby (a must go is: La Fontanella Sistina), there's even a great pizzaria just outside the door (Zio Mario). A well assorted Coop is in 10 min walking distance.\nOnly minuses are the water pressure and a litte noise from the elevator. The elevator doesn't go to the top of this building where the penthouse is, so you have to walk the last small part.\nWill definitely recommend this, especially the penthouse. We only uses the reception once, and they were very helpful booking us a private taxi to the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:01:33.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
