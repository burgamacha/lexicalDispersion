Room was quite small but that wasn't a problem, very clean and comfortable. Could use more teabags, coffee sachets and milk but not a big problem. Very quiet, hard to believe you are in London. 10 minute walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, check the times of the bridge opening if you've never seen it. Have booked to go back in November for Christmas shopping. Good variety for breakfast, ate in the restaurant once and was ok. If you need a snack there is a Sainsburys literally round the corner!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:31:20.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
