This hotel is less then a 10min walk to times square. Felt very safe in the area. We was there for thanksgiving and the staff gave out maps of the route for the parade which was very helpful! Only had a problem with the safe once but this was quickly fixed. The rooms are big for New York! Brilliant shower too! Would definitely stay again! We also went to the bar when it was happy hour and had a few cocktails!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:28:54.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
