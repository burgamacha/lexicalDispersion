I cannot say enough positive things about this lovely hotel. Upon arrival, I upgraded to The Level and it was totally worth it. The lounge is relaxing with a wide variety of tapas and alcoholic beverages. The Ros√© cava was excellent.. Room was beautiful with a lovely view of the city. Although I was measured in my eating, breakfast was loaded with tempting choice. The housekeeping, breakfast, lounge and front desk team all professional, pleasant and helpful. Special nod to Julio (Iglesias ) and the lovely young lady from Mexico at the check in desk in the Lounge..so nice. Only slight downside was the Skyline Lounge. On a Saturday night I went for a drink and the view..the crowd was overwhelmingly young and it was a full blown club. Everyone seemed to be having a lovely time ..but not my scene ....so no drink...no view.\nUsually, I'm quite unimpressed with the Spanish chains (Caribbean) but I'm now a Melia fan girl. Will look for them later this year when I visit Spain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:51:05.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
