It also had much better ambiance than chain hotels.\nMy three suggestions for improvement would be:\n1. Provide complimentary water. If your room rate is US$250 per night, don't charge your guests $9 for a bottle of Fiji water in the room, especially since the hotel is a bit old and the tap water probably not healthy to drink.\n2. There is an excellent diner next door with a 4-star TripAdvisor rating. Suggest you price your hotel's breakfast accordingly, or better still include it in your room rate. I had a great breakfast next door at the diner for $10.\n3. The shower is a bit of a trickle. Would have been nicer to have been able to shower with a better water flow.\nNotwithstanding the above, I did like this hotel and do recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:06:52.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
