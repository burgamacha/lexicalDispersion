We stayed in a Waverly Queen room on 17th floor which was a nice size, well appointed and maintained and had a fabulous view. The staff was excellent-very friendly and helpful. The lobby is cozy with a fireplace and some nice sitting areas and restaurant/bar was a great place to have drinks or breakfast. Location is perfect for Village, Chelsea, Soho, Flatiron, etc. We were with 3 other couples and all enjoyed our stay there.\nRoom Tip: Room 1703 was nice size and great view of Freedom Tower See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:48:44.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
