The hotel is in a perfect position, right next to the rail station, all the sights are walkable but if you don't fancy the heat of the city, the tubes are really easy to use and stops are all nearby to the hotel.\nWe asked for another room as the ground floor rooms are on the small side. The staff were happy to help and we were given a more salubrious residence. Be warned, if you are a big breakfast eater, then plan a trip out to a local cafe. The hotel's breakfast is basic to say the least.\nAll in all though, the hotel was brilliant, the staff were lovely, bedrooms clean and comfy, location perfect. Forge the hotel chains - this is Italy, beautiful old building in the middle of town and great value for a traveller on a budget. Enjoy!\nRoom Tip: Ask for rooms on a higher level, ground floor are a little small.
