No need to reconsider other room types. View was awesome, just staring out of the window watching the tower. Of course, if you have a deep pocket then go for Shangri-La hotel. But Holiday Inn's view is good enough for me. Think about it, you are not in the room all day long, as you will be sightseeing. You'll only be in the room in morning and at night, refer to photos.\nRoom is spacious considering many other hotel rooms in Paris are tiny 12 - 15sqm range. This room allows you to open up two large suitcases and still prance around a little in front of the bed. Rooms are clean, service is good. Receptionist are able to speak English. Hotel is near metro too.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:53:03.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
