The location is great--close to a major subway station, convenient for shopping and an easy walk to the theater district. And while the rooms are very small (larger ones are available at a higher price), the price is extremely reasonable for such a good location. There is a club on the 7th floor where you can have any meals you want or a drink before dinner. We had only two complaints. The plugs on the desk for charging phones and tablets are loosy-goosey and basically don't work (one out of three did on our last trip, so I had to charge my things in the bathroom). The other was the heating. It was extremely cold on our last trip and the thermostat was set to 72 degrees. If you turned it up, it went back to 72. And while that might sound comfortable, it wasn't. It felt more like 65. This has never been a problem before, but it was this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:34:01.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
