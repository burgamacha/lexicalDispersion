I loved the location. The bathroom had lots of shelf space and was larger than the bathrooms at 5 star Hotels. My bed was comfortable, and my room had a fridge and a microwave. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I stayed in room # 307. which was quiet and away from the Street. I would tell all of my friends, family and co-workers to stay at this Hotel, if visiting NYC. The price I paid for 6 nights was a great bargain, compared to other Hotels in the area.\nRoom Tip: Room 307 if you like quiet and don't care about a 'view'.
