Our check in was flawless. The bellhop took our bags to our room. The room was spacious but a bit dated. Everything in the room was comfortable and everything worked except the safe. Not really a big deal. We had breakfast (included) in the buffet with a wide selection of Western and Asian dishes. These changed somewhat daily! Everything was quite tasty although not always hot...but still good!\nMy only complaint was the smell. Near the elevators and the public toilets by the buffet, there was a very strong sewage smell as noted by other guests. At times it was minimal, others quite strong. If you get past that, it is a good basic hotel. Very close to restaurants and two different shopping malls. Don't miss the food street to the west and north of the hotel!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:53:54.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
