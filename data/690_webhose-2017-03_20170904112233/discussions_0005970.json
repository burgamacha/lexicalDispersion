Checked into the hotel a little earlier with no issues. Small hiccup of being sent to an uncleansed room. I get this can happen so no big deal. Notified staff immediately, they apologized and got us into a new room. Archer sent drink vouchers for the mishap for the lobby and rooftop bar.\nRoom size comfortable compared to other hotels I've stayed at. Modern finishes. I'd pay the upcharge for the floor to ceiling views of the Empire State building. Rooftop bar has awesome views. Not more than a 5 minute trek to Times Square.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:32:20.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
