From arrival to departure you are treated as a valued guest and a human being. The staff are friendly and approachable. There is considerable expertise to be found at the concierge's desk. The rooms are perfectly formed, considerable thought has gone into their design even when space is at a premium. The bar, lounge and dining room are all extremely pleasant places to pass an hour or four!\nMy wife and I have been staying here for seven years now and the last visit was our eighth, it has got better in many ways in that time but most important is the overall consistency of product. Decorations may change, some staff may come and go but as a customer you can be assured of a first class stay in considerable comfort and style. Well done The Goring, can't wait for the next visit!\nRoom Tip: Choose what you can afford, do not be put off by the smaller rooms.
