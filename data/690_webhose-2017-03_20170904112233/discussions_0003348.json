We really enjoyed the breakfast times as well as most hotels stop breakfast at 9/930 in true laid back Italian style breakfast was available until 10:30!\nWe didn’t eat in the restaurant connected to the hotel however 10% discount and a free bottle of wine was offered to us, however we did stop by the hotel bar one night!\nCheck out was mid day giving us plenty of time to shower, eat and pack with no rush or fuss involved.\nThe location of this hotel is second to none with great shopping literally around the corner and the Trevi fountain pretty much on your doorstep, Pantheon and Spanish step just a 10min walk away!\nTop tip hit the cafe/restaurant Oggi Roma Gourmet opposite the hotel for light bites and drinks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:59:10.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
