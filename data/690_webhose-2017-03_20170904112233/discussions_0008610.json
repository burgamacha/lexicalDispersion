Usual room extras like TV and tea/coffee making. Air conditioning and double glazing keep any outside noise out.\nLatest bathroom fittings means shower only. Towels and soap dispensers provided.\nGood breakfast buffet to start the day with.\nLocation is perfect for attractions in the area such as Shard, Borough Market, South Bank. Underground and National Rail very close by (5-10 mins walk).\nThis new Inn is a welcome addition to the portfolio in London, I got an early booking low price, but I notice it is becoming very popular and is already sold out some weekends, so book well ahead if you want to stay.\nRoom Tip: All rooms air conditioned and double glazed.
