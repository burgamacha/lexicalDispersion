Both were available at this hotel and were okay, although not spectacular and hotel lacked a little soul and character, although that did give us cleanliness, efficiency and the led bathroom wall that occupies a 9 year old for an inordinate length of time. Hotel is close to the underground station as well as a short walk to London the edge of the city. Perfect for a business trip and good for a place to stay when out and about being a tourist. Swimming pool, steam/sauna and spa pool nice way to spend 30 mins winding down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:51:25.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
