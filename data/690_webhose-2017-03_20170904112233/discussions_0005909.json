The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are small, yet very nice. They're very clean and beds are comfortable. I was lucky enough to have a balcony that faced Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral which was amazing. I also had a mini fridge in my room which came in handy. The filtered water bottle machines save you A LOT of money and are a great amenity of this hotel. This can probably go without saying, but... location, location, location. The Jewel is very centrally located and within walking distance to just about anything you can think of. Overall, a highly recommended hotel!!\nRoom Tip: The elevator is a little noisy as I could hear it run, but not a big deal.
