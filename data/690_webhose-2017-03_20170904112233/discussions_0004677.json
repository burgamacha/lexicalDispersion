I love their website so that I could plan out my itinerary easily based on what there was to do on that specfic weekend I was going to be in NYC. I love the \"neighborhood \" so I know what was close by! It is an awesome sight. Then upon arrival I had inquired by email whether I could possibly have an early check-in and they said come to the hotel and we would be told then! When we arrived it wasn't but 15 minutes or so that they told us our room was ready! WOW! That was nice to freshen up before our afternoon matinee!\nThe view off of the terrace was stunning! The colors of the empire state building were breath taking! The staff were very friendly and we ordered room service and it came at a reasonable time and was very tasty too! The doorman was very cordial especially at 4:45am !! I will definitely stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:38:42.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
