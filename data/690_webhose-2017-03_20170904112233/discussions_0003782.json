We wanted a hotel close to the Broadway theaters and came across the Casablanca. It is conveniently located just steps from the square, but it is like a quiet sanctuary.\nFrom the minute we walked through the door held open by the doorman, we felt at ease.\nEven though we were early, the front desk had our room ready. Jeffery and his colleagues are true professionals and really seem to love what they do. All of the staff was very helpful whether it was advice on restaurants, attractions, or use of the subway. And because I had mentioned it was my wife's\nbirthday, there was a card and bottle of wine waiting in the room-nice touch.\nThe rooms are very comfortable, quiet, clean and well maintained.\nThe continental breakfast in Rick's Cafe was much more than your ordinary continental. Delicious fresh fruit, warm or cold cereal, eggs, pastries, yogurt, etc. Something for everyone. Great service too.\nThank you Casablanca, you helped make this \"the best birthday ever\"!\nJoseph Frackleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:12:01.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
