It is a hotel I always use during my visits. The location is central, it is literally 200 meters from the metro station (Cambronne) and it's a very central location a couple of stops away from your Eiffel and from other major attractions. The neighborhood is classy with several options for food and drinks. The price seems fair in light of the location. The rooms are typical of an ibis hotel, small but clean and neat.\nOne drawback this time was a very rude receptionist. She gave me the room key upon check in and as I turned away she started shouting \"Did I give you the room key? You shouldn't take the room key unless I give you the key!\". It was pretty disturbing. Then she asked \"what's your room number then?\" I said the number, she asked \"on what floor?\" I answered then she kept staring so I left !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:36:53.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
