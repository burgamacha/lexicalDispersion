The lobby staff was excellent and took care of our needs. The room (1119) was overall very nice but could use some updating but the bathroom was great. My biggest complaint was housekeeping didn't come to our room until 7-8pm at the earliest instead of while we were gone all day. We had to get up early at 4am for a train on the last night and they called my room and woke us up at 9:30pm to see if they could clean- I had the do not disturb on. Excellent western breakfast buffet and a good deal w/ the B&B package. Overall, very good upscale hotel in the heart of the city.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:09:51.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
