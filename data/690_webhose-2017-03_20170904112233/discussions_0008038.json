I chose this hotel based on reviews here and I am so glad I did! The hotel is all you need if you are looking for a central location and an excellent customer service! The single room is small but reasonable size for London. The breakfast is fine, not an English breakfast of course. The location is 5 minutes from Bayswater underground. Just turn left when you leave underground and walk straight till you reach Boots and then turn left again and you will see the Phoenix hotel. I highly recommend this hotel if you are on budget and need a good hotel. I got a deal for 60 GBP per night breakfast included and I could not ask for more. Thank you Phoenix Hotel staff for making this trip memorable and problem free ))", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:00:12.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
