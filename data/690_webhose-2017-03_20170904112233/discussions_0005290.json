This was primarily due to the lack of light in the suite and we wanted the light flooded room (hopefully with a balcony!) I had seen on the website and social media.\nThe room was large by Paris standards - really beautifully decorated and a great ensuite bathroom with a powerful shower and lovely toiletries.\nThe receptionist on the Friday looked after us really well - booking us in and changing our rooms with no fuss. Check out was easy and accommodating with our baggage.\nThe rooms are quite warm and we had to sleep with the window open but that was OK.\nThe position of the hotel is good although the immediate surrounding area isn't what I expected - being quite commercial but I should have checked that out.\nThe restaurant next door is excellent - offering a great selection of food and wines. It is a shame that you are unable to put items to your room and that you have to albeit very briefly go outside to walk between the restaurant and reception to use the bathroom.\nOverall very good for the price.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:18:07.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
