I had no idea when I was researching what was cool around the lower east side that this was THE place on the LES, so you didn't have to go far.\nI stayed on the 11th floor in a Skybox Loft room, which was great for 1 person. An entrance hall led off to the bathroom on the right hand side, and then to the bedroom, and a sitting area with big windows on 3 sides. The views are quite spectacular. The bed was super comfortable, and it had a Nespresso machine, and a well stocked mini bar.\nThe Dirty French restaurant was fantastic, and the waiting staff were very friendly. I ate there once in the evening and also had breakfast there. All the food was amazing, plus there was Katz's diner over the road. The area was great, didn't have enough time to explore it unfortunately.\nI will definitely be staying here again if I come back to NYC.\nRoom Tip: The higher the better. Skybox loft is great.
