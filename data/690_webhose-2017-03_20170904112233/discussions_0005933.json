Just returned from NY and was present during storm \"Stella\" on arrival the check-in was both quick and undertaken by very courteous staff. Most of the garbage written about the rooms are total nonsense as we found our room no 1511 to be very clean and the bed and bed linen to be both very comfortable an exceptionally clean. The room size was more than adequate for our stay, the shower / bath water was more than hot enough to enjoy. The security to all floors is again excellent you cannot access any floor above reception without showing room key once again this ensures everyone feels very safe and secure during their stay at the Paramount. We were given free wifi during our stay and never experienced any difficulties in using this, Approx. 2 minutes\nwalk to Times Square and 1 minute from 8 avenue with its bars places to eat, bus stops, underground etc. You can easily access all the sites and facilities from this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Room 1511 was very quiet with little or no noise from ground level See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:03:35.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
