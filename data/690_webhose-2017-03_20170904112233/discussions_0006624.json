Having not stayed in Paris for a few years we were at the mercy of reviews and so took pot luck.\nAnd we were so glad we did. From the first contact while booking by telephone the staff were so very helpful and could not do enough for us.\nThe Hotel itself is well located near lots of bars and restaurants and is decorated beautifully. Like many European city hotels the rooms are not huge, but are superbly finished in a modern style and spotlessly clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable with gorgeous linen.\nWe will be definately be coming back", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:23:10.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
