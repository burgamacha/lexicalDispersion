It's clean, rooms are a good size, comfy beds, nespresso coffee machine and tea making facilities in room, great bathroom with fantastic shower. The staff were all so friendly and helpful, standard was very high. We booked special offer with breakfast included. This was continental style but excellent, loads of fresh fruit, yogurts, cooked meat and cheeses...More than enough to keep us going through the day. Our room was right on the entrance to brick lane, and the only downside was that it was quite noisy, but this is central London and only to be expected. I suppose rooms at the back would be quieter, but we liked the skyscape view so put up with the noise. The absolute icing on the cake is that it's right around the corner from Aldgate east tube station, so incredibly convenient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:47:40.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
