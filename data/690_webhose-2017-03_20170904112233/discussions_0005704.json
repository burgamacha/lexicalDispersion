The hotel is very close to many cafes, shops, brasseries, bars and bistros. Walking distance from Sacre CÃ¦ur.\nOn my birthday, they gave us a gift card for a river boat tour on Seine. The tour was beautiful and highly recommended. The staff spoke good English and was very helpful with travel information and restaurant bookings.\nSince the hotell is located very close to Blanche metro stop, it can be a bit noisy. But this is Paris! The aircondition system was somewhat tricky so we had to open the windows. But no big problem.\nDecent breakfast buffet. Or try a local cafe just down the street.\nI would for sure come back to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:31:16.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
