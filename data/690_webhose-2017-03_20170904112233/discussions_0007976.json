Spacious room.\nBooked on hotel website and leveraged offer that included breakfast each day, really glad that I spotted that since it was such a pleasure to start our day with delicious coffee, and an expansive view of Central Park. Steps from 5th Ave, Central Park, Lincoln Center, Subway etc.\nIt is an older hotel, and could use more updates - but for for us it was just fine.\nBig kudos to the hotel staff on the morning of our departure for JFK. We didn't know that a 1/2 marathon was going on, and there were periodic road closures - including on both sides of the hotel. They took care of us, loading up our bags, popping out the back door - and when he saw we would not get a cab on 58th, the bellman escorted us and our bags on the cart all the way down to 5th avenue - where he grabbed a cab at a light. Now that is service! Thanks again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:01:30.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
