We had a king suite with a pull-out sofa bed for the girls. Our room (815) had a lovely view of the park. Street traffic was noisy at all hours during the week and quieter on the weekend. It woke me up a few times but the girls slept well, being just slightly more interior. The suite had a tiny bathroom with shower (no tub), but was very clean. The size of the room was impressive for NYC, at a great rate. There were many walkable options for all meals. We ate at Third Ave Ale House (with kids) and San Matteo (great pizza, a bit of a walk) and imported breakfast twice from bakeries within two blocks of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The subway is a few blocks away (a 10+ minute walk). Overall the hotel had a very warm and welcoming feel; we will stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:52:55.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
