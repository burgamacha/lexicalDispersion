This elegant hotel has a superior location, in front of the picturesque Tuileries Garden, with a playground, carousel, and ferris wheel, fountains, paths, art, and space for just being at ease in the heart of the city's beauty. There are also two metro stops, the Louvre, the Orangerie, and more within a five minute stroll.\nWe stayed a week as a family of four with a baby and toddler at Hotel Brighton. We anticipated the Hotel meeting our needs, but we never imagined the superior service they would provide for every member of our family. We travel often and are accustomed to mixed experiences with small children, but this was only lovely. We had travelled a full day and arrived early; the hotel quickly arranged for early checkin so we could let the children sleep. Without request: They set up a crib, bottle warmer, and diaper waste can. Additionally they set biscuits out for our children, children's books, color pencils, and lovely keepsake coloring books of the locations of Paris.\nAt breakfast we never expected baby accomodation, but the exceptional staff quickly brought a baby seat each day, offered hot chocolate to our toddler, and truly made every member of our family feel at ease.\nAndre, one of the staff members, clearly went out of his way to make our toddler (and family) feel welcome. Each day our son looked for him when we reached the hotel; he asked our little guy about the day and gave him time that he valued. This type of exceptional service guarantees we will return.\nI highly recommend Hotel Brighton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:30:10.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
