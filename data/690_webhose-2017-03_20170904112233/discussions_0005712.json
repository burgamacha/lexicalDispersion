The details:\nCheck-in. Fairly standard and efficient. The lady at reception was very gracious and my room was ready at 9:30AM. Luggage was self-serve, and a brief description of the facility was given along with my key card.\nAccommodations. New rooms! Everything was clean and worked like a charm. The walk-in shower was particularly welcome. Housekeeping was excellent. The lighting in the room actually made sense and wasn’t too tricky to operate like I’ve experienced in other renovated hotels. Sleep quality was excellent and room temperature easily controlled. My room overlooked the street below but the noise was not a factor.\nService. All around excellent. I forgot shaving cream and that was given out twice. Anything that I asked the staff to do was completed quickly and graciously. Restaurant reservations were confirmed, tours booked, directions given, and esoteric questions answered easily and professionally.\nAtmosphere. Hip and cool; it reminded me of the Gramercy Park Hotel in NYC. There is a billiards table in back along with a common area to hang out with your fellow travelers. Great decorations, great library collection of a wide variety of eclectic but interesting books. Checkers, backgammon, and chess are all available. The idea here is to let you enjoy your time with those around you to the maximum and it works. Great, great atmosphere.\nRestaurant & Bar. Rooftop location that can’t be beat. I visited the bar several times during my stay and ate breakfast in the main dining room overlooking Paris on a couple occasions. The view is the real drawing card here but the service and food (and alcohol!) were definitely above average.\nOverall. Highly recommended stay here in general Great location, service, atmosphere, etc. etc. I would most definitely stay again if I was in the area.
