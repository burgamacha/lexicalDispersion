The room was on the 9th floor and was so lovely and quiet! Was an average enough ok but was perfect for the two of us. the bed was so so comfy and we slept great ! The tv had lots of good stations if you wanted to watch the news or any of the soaps.\nThe location was the best part,it was a five minute walk from where the shuttle bus to stansted airport left us. And in the same area there was the tube station which connected us to everywhere we needed to go . The tube station was also connected to the Westfield shopping centre which has so many amazing shops !\nAbout a 10 minute walk away is the queen Elizabeth Olympic stadium as well and that was a great tour and the area is lovely !\nI had mentioned it to one of the ladies on reception that it was my boyfriends birthday the second day we were there and they left us two little bottles of prosecco and chocolates for us which was so lovely and we really appreciated the kind gesture! (Thank you to lady with the long dark hair never got your name !)\nThe breakfast that was included was lovely ! Would've liked a few more pastries but was really nice ! Good choice of juices and coffees and cereals !!\noverall we had a great trip and we will definitely be back the next time we visit London :)\nthanks so much for everything !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:26:24.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
