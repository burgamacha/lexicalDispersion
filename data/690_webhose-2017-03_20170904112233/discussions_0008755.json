The hotel was clean and a great location for me. The staff was very nice and the room was clean and I had a nice view. For the price I paid it was more than worth it. Watch the prices on the hotel, while I had a great rate in January, the price is quite a bit higher when I head back to NYC in April. Note that the bedroom is just about all bed, it was tight to walk around the bed, but I didn't mind, I was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice.\nRoom Tip: Get a corner room for a great view and lots of light.
