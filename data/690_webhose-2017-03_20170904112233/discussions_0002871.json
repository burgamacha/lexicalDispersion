Very convenient to walk less than a block to the school. Great eating joints nearby. The hotel serves a nice buffet breakfast with fresh croissants, fruits, eggs, yogurt and beverages. The rooms were a little small, but OK compared to Paris standards. There is AC available in the rooms which was a big relief as it was quite hot and humid in September. The bathroom had a bathtub and toiletries were provided by the hotel, quite convenient. There is an elevator, little small, but sufficient to carry two persons and couple of bags. The front desk staff were quite helpful and we left our bags for a day when we were moving out as we were out for the weekend, and they were quite accommodating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:50:28.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
