I did some research ahead of our stay and kept coming back to the stunning location and great reviews here. We stayed 2 nights, our room was small, but we could just about see the top of the Eiffel Tower in the distance, and sacre cour the other way. We had a little balcony at the front which was great for sunset. Our room was however clean, comfortable and stylish. We had a voucher for a free drink each in the bar which was a nice touch. We walked to the tower- took around 45-60 minutes, we ended up getting a taxi back from the champ élysées however as it was such a hot, draining day. We had a meal booked on a boat which departed from the bridge nearest to the louvre which was perfect, and would highly recommend it. The louvre, and musee d'orsay are a stones throw away. We also visited the moulin rouge, and the hotel were able to help with arranging taxis. The hotel is quiet, with excellent service. The location for us was perfect, and although our room was small, it was stylish and contemporary with traditional touches which we loved. Would return in a heartbeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:45:09.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
