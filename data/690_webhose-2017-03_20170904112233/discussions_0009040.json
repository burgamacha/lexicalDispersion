It is in a great location, right next to Waterloo Station and was very easy to find. Check in was very quick and easy. I had a room on the first floor which i found a good size and was very clean. As a woman on my own, i felt very safe in the hotel. I used the hotel as a base to go and see various shows and the longest walk i had to the West End was only 20 minutes. I was going to stay in the Leicester Square Premier Inn but for the price of two nights there, i got 3 nights at this hotel. The trip wasn't perfect: There was a bad smell in the stairways, as my room was right beside the elevator i could hear the elevator going during the night, the toilet sometimes took a few goes to flush, the room became very warm in the night and you aren't able to open the window. But all in all, i would give this hotel 4.5 out of 5 and i would definitely recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:14:23.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
