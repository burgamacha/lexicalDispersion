Also right outside the charring cross station. The room was clean and well presented and is clearly fairly newly done. The bed was very comfortable and room a good size. The bathroom was amazing with lovely heated floor and a big shower with a powerful head and spotless. Another very nice touch was a complimentary mini bar which was actually free and well equipped with snacks, milk, coke and water. Reception staff were friendly and very helpful. All in all would definitely recommend and would stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:53:42.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
