The Colosseum was a 10 minute walk and the Vatican was about half an hour away . We're in our late 60s so not striding out. The hotel is an older building with rooms full of character. Our room was small but the bed was large and comfortable and the bedding was changed daily - we both slept very well. The shower wasn't large but the water was hot and the towels were clean and fluffy. The breakfast was worth the money I felt - we only had breakfast on 2 mornings. There was fresh fruit - yoghurt - cereal - bread- meat - cheese - bacon - eggs - sausage - and a good range of pastries.\nWe ate in Caffe Roma once adjoining the hotel and it was ok. This doubles as the hotel bar with a nice buzz and a mix of locals and tourists.\nAll the staff we met were courteous and helpful - we intend to visit Rome again and would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:03:35.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
