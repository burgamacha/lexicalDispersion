(We didn't like the location of the new room and said that we would be happy to go back to our original booking but the Reception Manager found another Junior Suite and helped us to move - complete with birthday cake and balloons that the hotel had supplied. Thanks, Anne.) The new suite, 644, was lovely. Very spacious, very comfortable, very quiet, loads of storage, amazing shower. I could go on but suffice to say that the accommodation was faultless. Little touches like illumination inside the wardrobes and self-closing drawers were much appreciated. All of the staff are extremely pleasant and courteous at all times. This hotel will be our first choice for any future trips to London andIf we were going to stay anywhere else in London, it would have to be another Apex hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:04:48.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
