The grounds are very well kept and the general ambience makes for a relaxing stay. The time before when I visited I had a spa treatment which was professional and relaxing. The staff are friendly and the food is really amazing (best in the area). The only down side is the restaurant service, we have had a few times where we were obviously forgotten and waited a very long time for food - once at breakfast and once at dinner. Guess doesn't matter so much when on holiday, but definitely an area to improve on!\nRoom Tip: 235 is a very nice room (my Dad's room).
