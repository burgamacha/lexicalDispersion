Huge, beautifully appointed suites. Staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. Ordered room service twice and was very pleased. Food was delicious. Great amenities. Excellent location- in a quiet neighborhood but close to major sites. Only gripe was that I found for a 5 star property, the beds weren't very comfortable and the bedding was of lesser quality. Ate one day at Kona, their onsite restaurant. Wasn't too impressed- overpriced and small portions. Otherwise, I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:56:02.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
