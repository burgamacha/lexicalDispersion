I recently stayed there for 7 nights with my daughter and granddaughter. We shared a room with two double beds, a bathroom with shower/bath and toilet. All very clean, and serviced daily if needed. Although a light sleeper I had no problem with noise\nfrom the trains being in such close proximity. Double glazed windows certainly helped. The first room we had proved to be very noisy as it was on the 2nd floor, closest to the check in desk. As we had booked 10 months earlier, were unsure as to why we were given this room. After two nights, and very disturbed sleep, we requested and were given a much better room on the 5th floor. There is a really good bakery almost next door, where we bought coffee and croissants for breakfast each day. Also a Cantonese BBQ, and a ramen noodle restaurant were both very close, and good value for dinner.\nI can't imagine getting a hotel in such a good location, close to a couple of subways, at such a reasonable cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:28:51.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
