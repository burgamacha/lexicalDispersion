The hotel is in a quiet residential area with metro a 5-10minute walk and convenient base for exploring the city centre of Paris without the tourist crown and noise. The staff were really friendly and helpful; we felt very welcomed to hotel and comfortable. My parents who were elderly really enjoyed their stay. The double rooms we booked queen bed were very clean modern and sufficient the beds are a bit small but thats only one niggle. The bedrooms were also cleaned every day which I thought was professional. The hotel has a lovely outdoor garden which we didn't get to experience due to the rain however I would not hesitate to stay here again it was perfect! I was told the hotel will be undergoing refurbishment for a 6 months from the end of March to make it even better so looking forward to stay here after the refurb. Thank you again Hotel Le Magellan for a wonderful stay.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a garden view and in the main building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:46:47.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
