We had an upper story room. It was comfortable and just fine for the first two nights. The staff were great when we checked in and provided lots of good information for getting around. Our last night there was very difficult, though because an exhaust system from a nearby building seemed to be getting into the air system for this hotel. After we tried to get to a room that did not have an objectionable smell, we found the other room options were as bad or worse. We never got a good explanation and we will not be likely to return, though we had no complaint with the cleanliness or the service.\nRoom Tip: upper floor is good See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:49:08.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
