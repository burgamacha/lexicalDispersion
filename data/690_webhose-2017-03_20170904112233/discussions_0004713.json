For me, it's all about the food. Yes, the beds were super comfy. Yep, friendly service and large rooms with a view.\nBut for me? I have some challenging food allergies (onion, garlic) and Chris Zabita, the executive chef, bent over backwards to make sure I had a great meal every single time. This kind of extreme service is sometimes lacking in NYC, where you just have to grin (grit?) and bear with it... but not here. The manager Linda is amazing. So are the wait staff, the desk staff .. even the cleaning staff was friendly and helpful.\nSound too good to be true? Well, it's not. Try it - you'll love them!\nRoom Tip: Ask for the upper floors - the views were awesome!
