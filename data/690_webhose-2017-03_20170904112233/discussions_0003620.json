Stayed here for the Wales Rugby weekend.. One word for this hotel.. Amazing!! The staff are so friendly and can't do enough for you.. The rooms are very well presented with ample space.. The restaurant is great.. Lovely choice of drinks and food.. Didn't eat here in the evening but other people's food looked lovely.. The breakfast was good and plenty of choice.. The vending machine selling alcohol was a bonus and came in handy when the bar was shut.. The hotel is situated a 5 minute walk from the main train station of Rome and is also only a 15-20 minute walk to the Colloseum and Trevi Fountain.. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.. I will definitely be going back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:46:49.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
