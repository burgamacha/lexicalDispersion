We had tickets for the 911 Memorial & Museum and wanted to be somewhere close given the traffic. This hotel was perfect for that - the location was great! We walked to a Soho restaurant for dinner and were able to walk to and from the Memorial the following morning (15-20 mins). The evening and morning hotel staff were all very pleasant and accommodating - giving us ample late checkout time. The bar was nice for a nightcap and the bartender engaging.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on a high floor See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:20:57.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
