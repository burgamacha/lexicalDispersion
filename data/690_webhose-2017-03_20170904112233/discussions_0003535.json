Had a wonderful experience. Love the comfort and hospitality of the place. Home away from home. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and spotless. My wife loved the rain head in the shower. Room 804. Staff was courteous and helpful. I had a wonderful dining experience at the restaurants and felt at home in the \"living room\". We visit Manhattan frequently and will make this \"our place\". We booked a week stay and will be back in the spring!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:39:29.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
