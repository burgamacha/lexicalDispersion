Now...we were only eating dinner in our living room area, and the most noise we could have possibly been making was laughing while sharing funny stories with one another from our day sightseeing. My sister went down to the front desk that evening and apologized, and we were told that the person that took the call came up to our floor and could not hear any noises coming from our room. So my question is this...shouldn't the manager have explained to our neighbor that they would not disturb our room until it was at least 8pm? After all, we're in a bustling city with lots of noises. Laughter coming through the wall should not be a cause for a noise complaint. This call quickly ruined our appetites and put a HUGE hamper on the rest of our trip while in the hotel, for we barely talked above a whisper for the next five days while we were there.\nAnother cause of complaint: there is a new daily $10 surcharge to the room that can only be redeemed at The National restaurant. THIS IS NOT ON THEIR WEBSITE, SO YOU WILL NOT SEE THIS CHARGE UNTIL YOU CHECK IN! This is really ridiculous, unless one is planning to dine at The National, which we do not. It's just an additional, unnecessary fee! If one stays there for 7 days at an avg of $300/night, then that's an additional $70 for nothing, unless you try to do as we do and purchase one drink from the bar each night. Of course, we purchased more than that...there were four of us in the room...it's price gouging! Management, PLEASE CONSIDER REMOVING THIS REDICULOUS FEE!\nSo I would recommend this hotel, if you don't mind being quiet 24/7 and if you don't mind paying another additional surcharge. I recommend your getting to know Angelo, for he's a huge compliment to the hotel, and he will help you in any way he can when needing a car, confirming which car is your Uber ride, or just need a quick tip to get somewhere. He's always there to greet us each morning as we leave and welcome us back to the Benjamin.\nRoom Tip: Select a corner suite to have sights of the intersecting streets below.
