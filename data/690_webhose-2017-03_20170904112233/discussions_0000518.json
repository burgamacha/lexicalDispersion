Double Happiness Courtyard Hotel was just what we were looking for to experience a traditional courtyard hotel. Great location, just 10 minute walk to the subway. Shops and restaurants nearby.\nIndigo at the front desk was delightful and helpful. Great recommendation for dinner and we were able to purchase tickets to a kung fu show directly from the hotel. We stayed in a Luxury Wedding Suite, located on the main courtyard. It was beautifully decorated with heavy dark wood canopy bed and furniture and very comfortable. Nice thick mattress and bath with shower.\nComplimentary pickup from the airport was included with our room as was breakfast. Cozy breakfast room with Chinese and Western items. Lots of fresh fruit and baked goods. Hot water heater and tea in the room. Shampoo, conditioner and body gel in the bathroom. Hotel had a nice cozy bar area with limited choices...but great to sit down with a Tsingtao after a day of touring. Would definitely suggest the Double Happiness Courtyard Hotel if you would like an authentic experience.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on the courtyard.
