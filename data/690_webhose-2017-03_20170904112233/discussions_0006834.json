We didn't want to spend a whole lot on accommodations so we combed the web looking for reasonably priced hotels. We found Pod 31. The price was right as we only needed a clean, safe room. We booked the room with a bunk bed and private bath. Yes, bunk bed. Each bed had it's own T.V. The room was small with not much room but it was all we needed. It was a wonderful stay with great service, nothing fancy but if all you want is a safe, reasonably priced stay then try Pod 39. It's on 39th Street as it's name implies, with great shopping not far away. We were pleasantly surprised and would stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:48:42.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
