We hate to waste any minute looking for food or on the way to the sight seeing places while we are traveling. We love the location of this hotel! Just walk out of the door. It is the Times Square. You can walk to everything: sight seeing, restaurants, bars, Broadway shows, subway station, the bus center and a lot more. There is a Walgreens within 2 minutes walk in case you need anything. It saved us a lot of time from transportation.\nWe love the decoration of the hotel. The rooms are tiny, but so beautiful. Every detail is done with their great taste and quality. Their staff members are very welcoming and helpful. Concierge is there 24hours to answer your questions. There is a free 3 hour happy hour with wine and cheese. The speed of the free wifi is pretty good. The coffee machine is excellent! Free 24hour fresh coffee and tea. Rooms are sound proofed and the bed and pillows are comfy. As a very light sleeper, I slept pretty well.\nWith the great location and complimentary breakfast, WIFI, tea, coffee, wine and cheese in the hotel, We saved a lot of time and money. This is a true home away from home.\nIf we could have some more diary choices in the breakfast, if will be 100% perfect. We only had boiled eggs for every day.\nWe recommend this hotel to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:07:11.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
