Nearest bus stop is across the road. Friendly staff and efficient. Breakfast was included and basic selection is served. The breakfast area at the lobby can be quite cramp as tour group tends to dine at same time. Rooms are clean and the size are pretty decent in London. Ice machine can be found at the lobby and tea making facilities in room are complete. The washroom doesn't come with a tub but the shower is good enough. Definitely a good property to choose when you're up for a quick visit to London!\nRoom Tip: Better room in next building.
