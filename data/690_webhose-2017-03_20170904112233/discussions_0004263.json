I booked the trip for my wife's 50th. We stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of a friend. She really got it right. The hotel is in a fantastic neighbourhood. Walking distance to the Louvre, the Opera and great shopping and restaurants. The hotel was clean, modern and the staff were excellent. Whether it was a simple \"Bon jour\" or whether it was a dinner reservation or even just directions to a specific sight. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:58:18.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
