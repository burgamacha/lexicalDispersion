The hotel is in a fantastic position in lower Manhattan and near a number of tube stations.\nFrom my room on the 26th level I had a view down into one of the reflections pools of the 9/11 memorial.\nCheck-in was efficient and staff were friendly. There were 3 of us checking in and for some reason one of my colleagues booking didn't include breakfast. The lady who checked me in gave me some extra vouchers for my colleague. Fantastic generosity.\nI had a 1 bedroom suite on the 26th level. The room had a sitting room with a 2 seater couch a separate lounge chair, desk and TV. The bedroom was also large and the bed was a king size.\nBreakfast was served in their restaurant 'Church & Dey' and they have a good selection of breakfast foods.\nI didn't have a problem during my stay and can say that I would definitely stay here again.\nThe hotel was damaged during the 9/11 attack. The hotel is an easy 3-5 minute walk to the 9/11 museum.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:55:51.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
