Within walking distance to everything with the exception of The Vatican.. however this can easily be reached by the \"A\" line metro which is a minutes walk from the hotel. In addition the reception staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The restaurant Cotto linked to the hotel serves a lovely breakfast and its a lovely spot to finish off a day sightseeing sitting on the terrace sipping chianti. Can not fault this place at all. We hope to return on our next visit to Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:52:07.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
