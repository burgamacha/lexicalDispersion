Beds are comfortable and had a view of the near buildings, the hotel personnel was really friendly and helpful. Is near the Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building (5th Ave) and Time Square. They offered a good breakfast every morning. Ana Tavares was very helpful and paid attention to every little detail to make us feel at home.\nI would definitely come back and recommend it to a friend!\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have the best view of the street and buildings around the hotel See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:36:58.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
