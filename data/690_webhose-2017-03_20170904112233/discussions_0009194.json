The check in staff make every effort to help. My phone charger was not working and they offered to charge my phone for me. As I arrived quite late I grabbed a quick bite in the restaurant, which was ok, but the staff again provided excellent service. The room was adequate, large for London City. My room overlooked the Grange Hotel, and needed to ensure the black out curtains were pulled due to the bright purple lights from the signs. One thing I do not like about the Premier Inn is the soap which is available from dispensers in the bathroom as it has a very clinical smell. There is a selection pillows to suit your preferences. I would stay again as ideal location but if cost was no object prefer the Grange across the road. Good choice of restaurants and bars nearby too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:05:20.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
