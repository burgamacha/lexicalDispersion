I have to say that Hotel Edgar is one of the best hotels I stayed in Paris thus far. I usually travel to Paris twice a year and stay in hotels around St. Germaine, but this time I wanted something different. The commute from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the hotel is pretty simple. You can take the 4 or 3 to Reaumur –Sebastopol or 6 or 8 to Strasbourg-Saint-Denis and the hotel is about 4 minutes away. I arrived the day after Christmas and the streets were desolate because the hotel is situated in a commercial area. However, the hotel is close to restaurants like Frenchie’s, Dauphine and Chateaubriand and walking distant to Le Marais. In terms of the staff, “magnifique”, the staff made us felt like we were part of their family. Harris, Johann, Adrian, Charlotte, the manager of the hotel restaurant (thank you for playing the Zouk music). They made us feel super special. The hotel is the best for me because we got super friendly, welcoming, helpful, courteous, attentive and willing to accommodate everything our little heart desire staff all in one hotel.
