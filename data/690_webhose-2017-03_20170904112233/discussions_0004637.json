The Smooth hotel was exceptional. Newly decorated cozy rooms. The location is very central. The breakfast buffet has everything you could want. North Amercian and European fare and lots of it. We did have one mishap but the staff couldn't have handled it any better. There was a major water leak in the ceiling of our room at 7:30 a.m. They had us packed up and moved to a larger room in less the 15 minutes. On top of apologizing persistently they had a tray of fruit and a bottle of wine in our new room before breakfast was over. We highly recommend the hotel to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:41:02.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
