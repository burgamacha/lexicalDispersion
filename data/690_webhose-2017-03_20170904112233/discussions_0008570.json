The rooms were very small, but if you are looking for a bed for the night this is not really an issue. Hotel was very clean and nicely decorated, and well equipped with everything you would need including shower gel, hairdryer, tv, tea station etc. The main street round the corner has lots of restaurants and shops and this would be an easy place to get to from Heathrow.
