The showers are also worth a mention - lashings of hot water and real power!\nThe concierge was wonderful! We all speak a little childhood French but he was fantastic- even booking tickets for us and supplying maps to get about and explore Paris together.\nWe organised champagne upon arrival (birthday amongst us) and this was ready and chilled in our rooms when we arrived.\nIt's a beautiful hotel, our rooms even had balconies so we could sit and soak in the atmosphere around us. The staff also recommended restaurants in the local area and we were very happy with their suggestions.\nIt was a great break, made better by such attentive service and beautiful hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:41:06.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
