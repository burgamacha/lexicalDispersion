The hotel is typically french, their rooms are super clean and are quite spaceous. I had a room with a small balcony, which gives you direct views of the Arc de Triomph. This is a much nicer stay then in one of the big name hotel chains. The staff is so kind and trying to give you the home-feeling. The breakfast buffet, while sitting in a nice glass solarium, is delicious.\nRoom Tip: I stayed on the highest floor, which was very quiet.
