Speke Resort is splendid! Absolutely love the place. We went around and the ambience is truly special. I work with Afro Tourism and we are on the lookout for great lodges and accommodation facilities across the continent which we can recommend to our clients or take them to. As far as Kampala is concerned, this is one of the top 3 resorts.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:33:47.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
