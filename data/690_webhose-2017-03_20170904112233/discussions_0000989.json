Best find in a long time in Paris. It's tucked in a small side street through gates, so very quiet and quaint. Don't confuse it with the 2* place it surrounds (which we found hilarious) it's the two buildings on either side both of which are lovely (see pic).\nI stayed for one night on a Sunday to give it a try as I had a night to kill before returning home, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The check in guy was very sweet, and despite having forgot to tell them I had a car I was still given one of their spaces, and let me tell you for that area I'd have gladly paid double to avoid driving around looking for a free space.\nThe hotel itself has been very well done, very calm and well appointed. My room was perfect for one, overlooked the internal courtyard but I didn't care. If you do care, make the request when you book. Very comfortable bed, well decorated and functional room, and a great rainshower. I never use the complimentary products but used the hand soap and even that was surprisingly good quality. Remember it's Paris people. For a room less than €200 don't expect a two bed suite with sweeping views of Sacré Cœur. That said, probably in my top three of best boutique hotel room in Paris for that price point.\nThe location is fantastic. Two minutes to Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière which has so many places to eat and drink (highly recommend Pedzouille BTW) and for me perfect as it was less than 10 minutes to Frenchie Wine Bar, so despite my late arrival could still find a decent meal on A Sunday night. And it was so quiet, so you can dive into the fray of Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière then stumble home to a quiet night.\nThey also have a 24 hour honor bar which I thought was great but also realise if my friends ever stayed there en masse that honor bar would get annihilated.\nOverall, very much recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:52.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
