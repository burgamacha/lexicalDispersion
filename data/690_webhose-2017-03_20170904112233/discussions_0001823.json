It has a very good service and the hotel it self is in a very well condition. I would defintily cone again and recommend this hotel to friends.\nIt is very close to the Buckingham Palance, just 8 min ago. Also you can get from there to Hyde Park and easily to Westminster Abby. Restaurants are close by. You have a great selection of complementary food and water. Only the wifi didnt work as easily, but i was out all the time, so didnt need it as much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:50:39.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
