I suspect that to experience a new venue each evening within 1000 metres would take several weeks. The symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, is just a ten or twelve minute stroll away. There is a supermarket just fifty metres down the road if you want to stock up on nibbles or wine.\nThe hotel itself is modern, clean, the free wi-fi worked well in my room. The bed was comfortable and my room was quiet. France is reknowned for squeezy hotel rooms but mine was a sensible size with a sensibly-sized bathroom too. I did not expect a suite at this price, and I find travellers who complain about room sizes or scuffed paint need to get a reality check. I do not expect it to be freshly painted between guests, it was as clean and tidy as I expected. It is somewhere to sleep not to party.\nStaff at reception were invariably friendly and helpful, as were the breakfast staff. After just three days they knew I liked a double-shot espresso with my croissants and didn't need to ask my room number. I was grateful that late at night the front door was closed to prevent undesirables wandering around, what a strange thing for a fellow traveller to complain about!\nI arrived quite early in the morning and my room wasn't ready yet so I was invited to have breakfast even though my stay hadn't actually started. On the morning I left, as my shuttle was due before the breakfast start time, I was nevertheless given my coffee and a basket of croissants while I waited for the shuttle.\nI certainly highly recommend this hotel and have not one thing negative to say about it, it is not the Ritz and nor are its prices, I can only praise it.\nRoom Tip: My room was on the second floor, did not face the street and was very quiet.
