It is located in a nice area so you can see many places by walking:) and if you want to move farther there are 2 metro station in the area which is Republic and Strasbourg St Deniswhich caters alot of lines:), so I definitely will come back and recommend :)", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:01:13.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
