I have always been told to avoid Times Square when selecting a hotel. But I decided to give it a try since the doubletree offered a suite with 2 separate rooms and included a sofa bed. We stayed in a corner room on the 13th floor. The view was amazing. The room itself was perfect. I slept on the sleep sofa and found it very comfortable. I know some people have mentioned that the rooms were looking worn, I did not find that at all. We were not bothered by outside sound at all and all slept very well. The room also included a microwave, refrigerator and wet bar, which all came in handy. The convenience is amazing. There is a subway as soon as you walk out of the door and all the theaters are so close by. It was also nice to be able to run in to some of the fun stores before they got crowded. If you are thinking of staying here do not think twice, make a booking. You will be glad you did. I know I was.\nRoom Tip: Pick a corner room, the views are amazing.
