The reviews were relatively correct. The hotel is close to the subway. Most of the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We only had one issue as far a guest staff. The front office individual suggested a car service and wasn't helpful about cab information which caused us to spend 20 dollars for a five minute trip. Other than that I have no complaints. The room was a great size for three people. A refrigerator was included but no microwave. Although there was a one downstairs. The breakfast was really enjoyable....no need to go out for breakfast. The all day coffee was amazing. Honorable mention goes to James night security...he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area . Tiffany the night front desk individual was welcoming and delight to interact with. The success of this hotel is really because of the wonderful staff....from the breakfast staff to the mantience workers!! I would staff here again!!!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:37:51.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
