And The Best Western Au trocadéro is probably the best bet when it comes to location. The metro station is 10 metres from the hotel, with options of the bus nearby aswell. If u ask for a room with a view (the 4&5th floors) you'l probably get the view of the eiffel. And can clock the hourly twinkling of the tower lights.\nEventhough rooms are small (which is the case for most places in europe) the bathrooms are spacious and well equipped including heating rods for wet clothes. Clean white linen on the bed and black and white photographs of the city adorn the walls in a neat fashion.\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful- always giving you a ready grin (which may not be the case in paris)!\nThey also have a good spread for breakfast and busy and famous cafes around the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:59:33.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
