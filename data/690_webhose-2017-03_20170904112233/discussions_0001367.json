I found the front desk staff, bellman and especially concierge very friendly and helpful! (Well except one). The view from the room was amazing and hotel was close to everything you need in lower Manhattan. I agree that the furniture needs updating but were sufficient and the bed was extremely comfortable. I slept like a charm and woke up to the beautiful views of the Hudson and 911 memorial. I had breakfast there and found the breakfast fresh with good quality whole fruits. Stay here folks!\nRoom Tip: City view suites are spacious and amazing views!
