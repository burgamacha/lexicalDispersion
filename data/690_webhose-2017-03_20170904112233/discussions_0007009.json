This is a delightful hotel, everything you won't find in large plastic chain hotels. It's like living in a museum - with antique furniture and fascinating artifacts along the halls.\nIt's located in an hutong (alley) in the central old part of Beijing. Taxis are not enthusiastic about entering the hutong, but it is passable. The hotel is a short walk from the main streets so it's also easy to walk in.\nThe hotel affords an encounter with China of some 200 years ago, while providing all modern comforts. There is great attention to details and needs of travelers.\nThe staff is superb, ready to help in any way possible. They are knowledgeable and are fluent in English.\nThe rooms are comfortable and immaculate. They are well heated (ac in summer), selection of tea and kettle provided as well as a mini-fridge, a tv, map of Beijing and assorted amenities. Shower is great with ample hot water. Only weak point - the wifi was not great.\nBreakfast buffet available with a wide selection of food and drinks. There is a bar/restaurant open afternoon and evening.\nUpon checking out we were presented with a lovely container of green tea. A final touch to a wonderful stay. Would gladly return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:48:35.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
