I thought i would give the newly renovated hilton Opera a try even though it was set back a bit further from the Louvre. the Hotel and rooms were beautiful- classy . I liked it better than the Westin- it just felt newer- hipper and up to date. Traffic can be very congested in that area so it did take a bit of extra time getting in and out of the hotel area. I was worried about room noise but had a room facing the front of the hotel on a high floor facing the street and it was fine- no noise issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:20.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
