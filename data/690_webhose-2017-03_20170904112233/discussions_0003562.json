I am very happy with their hotel and the service. Room was meticulously cleaned everyday. Staff are very helpful and friendly. I love the staff at the breakfast as they made it feel like home.They also have the best hot chocolate! My daughter liked their gluten free options which they always placed on our table as soon as they saw us. Tea and coffee was available anytime in the lounge area. When I asked if I could bring tea up to our room one night, the woman at the reception happily gave me a tray to bring up.\nIt was easy to walk everywhere. A grocery store was just two doors down,\nI would happily recommend this lovely hotel and would stay there again if I ever go back to Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:01:51.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
