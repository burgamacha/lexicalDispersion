It was a lovely stay and everything was clean and neat. The reception was really good and efficient!! The location is also really great!! I stayed in a standard room and was sufficient for 1 person, could get a tiny bit small if you are more than 1 person. I would just want to mention 1 issue. Their is only a central heating system, not sure if their is a central cooling system as well. It was really cold outside but it was way to hot inside the room!! I could hardly breath!! I was told by reception that I cannot control my own heat in the room, so I need to open a window!! Which I did, the only problem with that was then it became really noisy!! Not sure what the rooms would be like if it is really hot? Say in summer, because if their is no aircon it might get really hot?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:00:38.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
