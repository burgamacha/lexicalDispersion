Very central location with lots of tourist destinations within walking distance. Do take advantage of their meal deal which includes a two course dinner and an \"all you can eat\" fabulous breakfast and is a real bargain. However, the coffee is awful and best avoided. The restaurant on the lower ground floor is pleasant and the staff throughout the hotel are professional and efficient. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:16:47.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
