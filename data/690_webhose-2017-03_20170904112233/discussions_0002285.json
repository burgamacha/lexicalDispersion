The staff was very helpful in identifying how to reach certain parts of the city (subway, walking, etc). This was my first trip to New York City, so I did not know what to expect. You should plan to do some walking as most places are easily reached by foot. I was surprised how much we used the subway to reach points of interest. The subway cost for a single ride is $3 and the machines do accept credit cards, though I always carried cash for this purpose. Also, I am happy to report that New Yorkers are very friendly and helpful! On the next block on the corner is a grocery store called Food Emporium where you can buy most anything for your day trips. Also, they had a very extensive deli which you could take to your room as a fridge and microwave are available. We saved quite a bit of money utilizing this option. Overall, this trip was everything I dreamed it would be and more. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again on my next visit to NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:40:44.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
