The hotel is all we needed for the time spent in New York - somewhere to rest and shower.\nAmazing bed. Wish I could have taken it home with me. Pillows could do with being a bit softer but after all the walking, you fall asleep no matter what.\nOne day we walked to the 9/11 memorial and back (20 miles or so in total) and my feet were killing me. I thought about a bath to try and relax them but this didn't work. The hot water doesn't last for very long. I think I got about 8 inches of warmish water but still went in anyway. Shower is a trickle but does the job if you give it time.\nNo problems other than the hot water. We ordered room service one night and it was great.\nBeware if you're storing luggage for a night flight out. The guys working on the storage desk like to make it clear that you WILL have to tip as they \"don't charge for the service\". You tip when you drop off, and you tip when you pick up #simple I find this a bit annoying as literally all they did was take my bag, walk 10 steps and put it in a storage room and got $10 for it. They also got $10 dollars for doing this in reverse. It's a good way to get rid of left over dollars I suppose.\nAll in all, a great stay at The Roosevelt Hotel, and I'd definitely be back. Great location, lovely foyer, nice staff - no complaint (well, not too many!)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:30:35.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
