With taxi's pointing us here, there and everywhere on where to walk and some taxi's saying it would be a 20 minute drive costing us over 50 euros (watch out for these scammers) when we KNEW it was a 15/20 minute walk, we just couldn't get our phone maps working due to no internet.\nHowever, after finally working our way round Paris, it was really easy to find the hotel. The hotel was close to the Cadet metro station, maybe less than a 10 minute walk, which was really convenient because we visited a lot around Paris. It had cafe's and restaurants up and down the bottom of the streets.\nThe hotel service was excellent, from the minute we entered we got help and advice on where to go, how to get to places, the mini bar, the breakfast times etc. The staff were really helpful and friendly. They even provided us with the balcony and Eiffel Tower view that we requested.\nThe breakfast was great, from 7 AM to 11 AM on weekends and until 10:30 AM on weekdays. I really enjoyed the sweet cake/bread they served, amongst other food. I do feel like they could have more varieties, though.\nThe hotel was well kept, our rooms were provided with toiletries, hair dryers, a safe, a TV and a free fridge with non-alcoholic beverages which they refilled once drinks were used up. Our room was also cleaned everyday and toiletries restocked.\nAll in all, a wonderful stay! We would definitely stay here again, if not the other Astotel hotels around Paris!\nMerci beaucoup!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:06:00.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
