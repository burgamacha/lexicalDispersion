Average room is small,but you are not there to stay in the room. We upgraded and moved to the front of the hotel facing the street. Loud outside? Yes of course,the streets are teaming with life. But if you shut the window it blocks almost all the street sounds .Open your big beautiful window and see the wow of the street. The rooms very clean. Bathroom extreme clean . The beds are hard mattresses.(if that bothers you have a few drinks and you won't care). Your in PARIS ENJOY. House keeping ,she was wonderful (and give them a tip it goes a long way)The staff was very friendly and helpful. English is spoken by deck stall . We had breakfast included with or Room,and I LOVED IT. Coffee tea water orange juice ham rolled on a plate (excellent tasting ham) ,cheese ,fruit,and let's not forget the bread. My God the bread and butter and jams and yogurt. Ppl that complain should stay home. Daniel was working the desk. That is a Gentleman. Thank you.
