Our room was gorgeous and had incredible views of the New York skyline--it actually overlooked St. Patrick's Cathedral. The hotel is in the perfect location for you to see the top sights and easily catch a Broadway show! In addition, we ordered room service a few times--the food was delicious and the service was prompt and professional. There is no doubt that we will be returning to the Palace on our next trip! It was truly a special experience!\nRoom Tip: Our room had a beautiful view!
