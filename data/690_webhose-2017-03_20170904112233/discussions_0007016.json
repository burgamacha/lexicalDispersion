The reception staff we really friendly and helpful - first in moving our rooms to be closer together - and second in helping us to plan our travel around the city. The rooms are really distinctive, spacious and cosy - also clean and have everything you need. There is very little noise from the street below. The location is very central - 5 mins walk to the nearest Metro and right on a nice street with restaurants, bars and shops and a nice feel. We were really pleased with the hotel and would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:23:02.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
