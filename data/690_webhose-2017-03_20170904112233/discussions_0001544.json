The gentleman on reception was extremely efficient and helpful from the outset and we were allowed a really early check-in - this first impression was excellent. The room was very comfortable with a good shower room. Some good extras which I didn't expect for the price (e.g. free wifi, a safe, free bottles of water, a good selection of toiletries, free slippers etc.). There was even a curtain which could be pulled across the room for privacy - eg for changing or to allow one person to sleep in peace while the other worked at the desk. Breakfast was included in the price and there was a good selection of food available. Free orange juice available in reception 24hrs a day was an unexpected bonus. The location suited us - just 10 -15 minutes walk from Gare du Nord. There were several interesting restaurants, cafes and coffee bars in the area - we enjoyed Tibetan and Moroccan restaurants when we were there. Our room (number 11) had two windows - both of which faced into totally enclosed gaps between buildings with absolutely no view and virtually no daylight - this wasn't a problem for us but if you want a room with a view you would have been very disappointed.\nWas I pleased that I chose this hotel and would I stay again. Yes and Yes!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:13:28.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
