The room was old fashioned but the bed very comfortable and the bathroom was always clean with a powerful water supply, great for showering or relaxing in the bath after a long day sightseeing. Bed and towels changed daily. The staff were very helpful and breakfast excellent. Shame that the bar was only opened by request and not well stocked, therefore no chance to chat to other trippers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:26:19.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
