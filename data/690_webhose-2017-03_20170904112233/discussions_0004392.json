We had room 101 which was a really great size. People complain about it being noisy but we didn't find that at all and we were only one floor up. Staff were friendly and very knowledgeable.\nThere's a really nice patisserie just around the corner which is nice for breakfast and also a little supermarket the other way. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we thought we'd be easily be able to get breakfast elsewhere for less than 15euro each, which is true if you want just pastries but, I underestimated how much food would cost so if you want a decent breakfast it's probably worth the money.\nThe only thing I would say that could be improved would be to provide more tea, coffee and also milk in the room. We brought our own tea from the UK anyway but we did go out and buy coffee and milk for the room.\nRoom was cleaned and made up everyday.\nThis is a really lovely hotel Ina fantastic location and I would definitely recommend booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:23:45.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
