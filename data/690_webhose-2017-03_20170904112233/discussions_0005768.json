We were very pleased with our room. It was nothing fancy but it was spacious enough, very clean and comfortable. It was also very quiet. We were on the 29th floor so we were high enough to be away from the city noise but there was also no hotel noise either. We could not hear any of the other guests which is always another plus. All the staff were very kind and friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:45:18.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
