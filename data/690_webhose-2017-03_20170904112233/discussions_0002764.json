No surprises!\nThe hotel was in very good condition, clean and it was very quiet. The location was amazing, just 2 min away from the Empire State which makes a difference as most of the attractions are around midtown.\nWe walked to other sections of the city from there very easily too.\nThere is a restaurant/pub next to it where they serve reasonable good food.\nThe hotel also booked for us a taxi to go to the airport at a flat rate so that was quite convenient and they sent for me a postcard that I wanted to send to my family.\nGreat staff, service and great location!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:54:17.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
