The building is beautiful. The rooms are spacious by European standards, the bathroom is very large with a very nice shower. And then there is an impeccable staff. They were real pros. Not convinced yet? Well, just try the spa...a great bonus that I did not even know about. Hammam, sauna, swimming pool, private, quiet. Perfect after walking downtown all afternoon. And the bed is terrific as well. Oh, did I mention the location? Pretty much perfect, walking distance from, Place des Vosges, Theatre de la Bastille, etc. That pretty much sums it up. I will be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:46:14.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
