However, as you explore the area, you realise that it is more 'shabby chic'. It is also ideally situated for many of the more ancient attractions. During our three days, we walked everywhere, from the Colosseum to the Villa Borghese and from the Vatican in the west to Termini in the east.\nThe welcome at the hotel and at breakfast was an ideal level of friendly, polite interest and attention.\nOur room was warmly decorated and furnished with a very comfortable bed and some of the best hotel pillows I have ever encountered. The bathroom was all that we could need, including a jacuzzi bath, which was very welcome, especially on the feet, after a long day of walking.\nFor such a small hotel, breakfast was very good, with a selection of juices, good coffees, eggs as desired (perfectly cooked every day), cakes, breads and fresh fruits.\nAll of the team there deserve high praise. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:50.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
