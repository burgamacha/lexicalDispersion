We visited on the 9th February for my husbands birthday and our wedding anniversary. The check in experience was wonderful and the team really made us feel welcome and special. The hotel is beautifully decorated and in a perfect location.\nJulien, jean-Pierre and all of the staff at this beautiful hotel were amazing. They really understand what excellent service is and go above and beyond to make sure that their customers are happy and taken care of. We felt very special throughout our stay and nothing was too much trouble.\nWe enjoyed having a drink at the bar and the Madeleines are to die for!\nThis hotel is a real gem and we will always stay here when we visit Paris, thank you for making our trip amazing and for making us feel special- we will be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:23:18.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
