I have to say, it was a really really pleasant stay! I must admit, when I checked in I lay down briefly and I could hear the trains passing - this was slightly annoying. However, I wasn't in the room long and then I went out for the whole day not returning until about midnight - when I came back I got into bed and slept really well and they didn't bother me! If I was going to spent a lot of time in the room, I would perhaps choose a different hotel - only for the fact the noise could be bothersome.\nThe staff were nice, really good shower, comfy bed and adequate facilities. The wifi was really fast also!\nBreakfast seemed like it was good value, I didn't have any - a colleague did and found it nice.\nIf I was in the area again, I'd probably stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:24:35.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
