We just love the location - quiet and calm but with great transport links to the city centre. Bars/restaurants are close by (3 within 2 minutes walk, others within 5.) We were given our favourite room - 303- which is small but perfect for us.\nThe front desk staff are all lovely, Vanessa remembered us from our last visit and gave us a warm welcome. I'm sure my schoolgirl French was appreciated but if yours is a bit rusty don't worry. She speaks good English, as do the others.\nAll in all a great stay: \"grâce à Dieu\" - we hope to return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:07:40.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
