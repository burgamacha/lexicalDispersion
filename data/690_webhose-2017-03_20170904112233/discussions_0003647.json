We are both avid readers and to have a hotel that is based on books and reading is excellent. All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful. The free continental breakfast was a great start to the day and the wine and cheese reception in the evening was a nice treat at the end of the day. Our room was very clean with almost no road noise (I doubt that there is a room in NY that is completely quiet !). There was complementary wi-fi which saved us from large mobile roaming bills. I can highly recommend this hotel and it is in a very convenient midtown location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:36:30.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
