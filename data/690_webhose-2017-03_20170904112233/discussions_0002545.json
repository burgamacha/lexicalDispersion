The neighborhood has a good feel and has several new good restaurants. The rooftop bar at the hotel has a great beer selection and a great view of Central Park. The rooms were not large, but very efficiently laid out, the linens were great, and the bed was comfortable. Traveling for business, I stay at a lot of different hotels, and I liked this one a lot! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.\nRoom Tip: We had a room at the front overlooking the street, and it had a lot of light.
