I was really impressed with the 2 computers available for the guests and the freedom to use them without hassle and also you are able to easily print. If you know Manhattan, you know that it can be a HUGE nightmare to find a public computer to use for free and to print. I got the smallest suite but it was still almost bigger than my apartment. I had a wonderful view! Everyone that works at the desk is awesome. John and Sam were very nice and helpful and so were the ladies at the desk. I will be coming back!\nRoom Tip: corner rooms are amazing!
