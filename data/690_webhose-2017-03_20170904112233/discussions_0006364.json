All employees were very helpful. Checking in and out were a breeze. The elevator service was the only drawback as it usually took a bit to get on due to the number of elevators serving the hotel but once on you went quickly. I appreciated the security of the elevator as well since you had to have a keycard. Floors were quiet. The rooms were modern and nice. The size of the room was medium which is subjective I know. For reference, I've stayed in NYC hotels where the wall was next to the bed and ones where you had quiet a bit of room to spread out. This was somewhere in between. A couple would have room. A family will find the room a bit tight but manageable. (We stayed in a double.) Location was fantastic for theater, Times Square, and access to the subway. The bar downstairs, was a cool little place for breakfast and more. Would definitely consider again for return trips.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:28:30.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
