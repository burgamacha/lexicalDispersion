We were upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival, which was a wonderful surprise, and the room was incredibly spacious and functional, especially for New York. You could tell there had been a lot of attention to detail in designing the rooms and upgrades over the years. Room was spotless, as was the gym, which was small but had new equipment and was impeccably clean. We also really enjoyed our breakfasts at the connected Wayfarer restaurant. Perhaps the best part of The Quin is the location, though. A short walk to Times Square and the theatre district, 2 short blocks from Central Park, and right on top of the subway station as well as everything 57th St has to offer. (Highly recommend dinner at Indian Accent nearby.) We do not hesitate to recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:17:31.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
