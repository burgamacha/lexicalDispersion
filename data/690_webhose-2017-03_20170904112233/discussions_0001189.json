Immediately upon arrival I was made to feel very welcomed, which continued throughout my stay. The staff are very helpful for restaurant suggestions, but also the mundane - but very important - transportation options throughout the city. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the breakfast as well and felt it was high quality. The location is within walking distance of many sites and very close to two metro stops. I will definitely stay at Hotel Monge again if I find myself back in Paris (which I hope I do).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:57:46.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
