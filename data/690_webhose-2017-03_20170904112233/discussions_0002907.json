Booked hotel for a long weekend. The location of the hotel was perfect. Metro/RER 1 within 5 minutes walk from hotel, thus making city sites accessible. Supermarch√© Casino/Food Market nearby to stock up on conventional snacks, breakfast, etc. True Parisian Farmers Market nearby with fresh vegs, fruits, cheeses, etc. on weekends (Sundays in the summer?). Room average European size and clean; I like the red accent wall, furnishings. Bathroom was very modern. Internet worked well enough for non-business purposes. Downside was the key drop, every time you leave/come back, not sure if this is changed. Staff was friendly and helpful. Pavillon Nation was perfect hotel for long weekend Paris excursion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:58:13.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
