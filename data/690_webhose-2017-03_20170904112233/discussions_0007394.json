Also walking distance to Kensington Palace which was a bonus as we were visiting the Lady Di clothes exhibition. We upgraded to an Executive King room but not sure that we had a sitting area as advertised but apart from sleeping we didn't spend much time there. Large comfortable bed, plenty of hot water and although we looked out to the main road it was very quiet, we were on the 3rd floor. Breakfast was fantastic and cooked to order much better than the buffet type kept warm under lights. Also I have to say how good and friendly all the staff were throughout the hotel. Highly recommended especially on a deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:41:00.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
