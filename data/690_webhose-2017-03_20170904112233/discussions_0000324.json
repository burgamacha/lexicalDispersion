The location is brilliant but the hotel is even better. I can not fault anything about it. I've never slept in such a comfy bed. The mini bar was extensive. Also loved the honesty bar in the lounge. Each of the rooms has its own distinct character and most had an open fire. Very spacious. All the decor throughout the hotel was unique, quirky and finished to a very high standard. We ate in the private dining area which was a lovely experiance. Every time we left our room it had been made up upon return with little treats left, chocolate, pillow spray. The breakfast in the morning was also first class. A really lovely stay.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:12:34.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
