Our room on 3rd floor was very clean and comfortable. Booked on Travelzoo deal so also had voucher for glass of wine which we went and enjoyed in the small but welcoming bar before we went out for the evening. Our room faced the main road but the secondary glazing shut out all the road noise. Very comfy bed and slept well. Breakfast could not fault everything freshly cooked and presented well with great service. Will not hesitate to stay again great value for money. Have stayed in much more expensive hotels in London which didn't have the level of service we had at Rydges well done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:41:05.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
