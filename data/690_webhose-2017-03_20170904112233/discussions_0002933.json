Without going into too much detail, we want to say that we fell in love with this hotel when we first saw it almost 2 years ago when we were looking at locations for our destination wedding. The refurbished rooms are stunningly beautiful, combining modern technology and amenities with old world charm. Each room is different and has it's own character. The grounds are stunning and well maintained. The spa is also newly refurbished and feels fresh, luxorious and relaxing. Location is fantastic, they remain close to the city center whilst maintaining great views from their property.\nHowever, where we really felt it was the place for us, not only for our wedding, but as a great hotel in Stellenbosch, was the staff. Jeanine provided a seamless, professional, friendly and absolutely outstanding service for our wedding preperations. She made us feel at ease as she knows the hotel and it's organisation like the back of her hand and provided us with gentle guidance and expertise throughout.\nHer colleagues, Johan, Debbie and our waiter for our wedding Soloman made our experience with Lanzerac one to remember.\nWe'd definitely return for another stay, as the Lanzerac has become one of our favourite places in Stellenbosch, thank you to everyone for such a memorable stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:07:14.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
