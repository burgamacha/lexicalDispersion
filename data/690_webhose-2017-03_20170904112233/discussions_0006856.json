First, the staff goes out of the way to be friendly and try to make your stay great. Secondly, the endless free hot liquids in the lobby (coffee and tea) during morning hours is a godsend. followed by the free wine during the early evening \"wine hour\".\nAs a Kimpton member you get free wifi (which so many hotels charge for).\nFinally while NYC rooms can be pricey, if you find a deal on the Kimpton website, you can save a bundle on this hotel. Even without the \"special offers\", if you have a AAA card you can shave some dollars off your bill.\nStrong, full shower! Bright bathroom lighting and robes! Very clean!\nMore TV channels than I knew what to do with. AND STAFF at the desk, at midnight or 4 a.m. Well done Kimpton. See you again soon....\nRoom Tip: It's NYC. So higher floors tend to be better, but inside rooms are the best. See more room tips Green Features: Kimpton does the usual. All NYC hotels seem to have this figured out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:21:16.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
