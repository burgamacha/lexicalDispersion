We stayed here for the weekend and location is awesome. Between Central Park and Times Square, a Starbucks Coffee just a half block away, subway station just a block and a half from the hotel. A great location to see the many NYC sights while walking and a quick commute via subway to midtown Manhattan. Good breakfast, wonderful room. I highly recommend and will stay again in a future trip to NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:32:24.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
