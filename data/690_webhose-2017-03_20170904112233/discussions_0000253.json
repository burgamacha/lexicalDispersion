Oh my! I felt like I was poetic, presidential, and proud to be part of this thing called Capitalism. Upon entering the tapestry laden hotel entrance you and your flock dart this way and that to arrive at the bar, or rather, The Bar. Amazing feel as you have to look up at the atrium and it can make you feel so individual, yet so powerful depending on your mindset. Book are abound and you feel like you soak up the knowledge as you gaze and as you soak up the wine or whatever's your poison. A truly rich feel and yet, so humbling. You have to go to understand. I cannot book the restaurant soon enough and will be doing so for a friend's birthday rather quickly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:02:36.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
