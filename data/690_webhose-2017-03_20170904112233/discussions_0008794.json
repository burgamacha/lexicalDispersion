They do appear to be upgrading the bedrooms and gone is the bathroom 'pod' which I was quite fond of.\nI don't like the removal of the check-in desk to be replaced by roving receptionists who attack you on entering the hotel. After a tedious journey I often like to sit down for a rest and a little refreshment before the actual check-in.\nApart from these minor annoyances I am happy to recommend.\nA little warning, make sure you book on company's site, as this is where you get best rate. I was hi-jacked to another booking company and had to pay for breakfast, which I thought I had included in my booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:29:07.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
