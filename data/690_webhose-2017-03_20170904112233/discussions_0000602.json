The rooms are the typical small size found throughout Paris, but well stocked with every amenity possible. Our room had a working a/c (often a rarity in Paris), a heated towel rack, and a Nespresso Machine. The free Wi-Fi at the hotel worked very well. The hotel location is just a minute or two from the Tuileries Metro stop, and a short walk to the Louvre. This location was perfect because it allowed easy access to Rue de Rivoli without the loud vehicle traffic near Concorde nor the suffocating crowds near the Louvre.\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful, and happy to speak in French or in English. We were even offered bottles of water and biscuits (Fauchon!) for our outings in the city and for our departure. Breakfast at the hotel is not a continental buffet style, but allows for choosing between three levels of breakfast depending on how hungry you are. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast of coffee and fresh pastries.\nThis is our fourth stay in Paris and our first time at La Tamise. We were so pleased with our stay, that Hotel La Tamise will be our hotel of choice on our next visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:38:00.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
