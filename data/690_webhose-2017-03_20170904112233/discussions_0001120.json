But if you want a small authentic Chinese hotel set in a Hu tong with brilliant staff and slap bang in the middle of Beijing then this is for you.Everything in a hutong evolves around the courtyard, so this hotel of 40 rooms wraps around it. Being winter we had to eat and relax inside ( no hardship as the interior has a wonderful localised warm feel ) but for the rest of the year eating and socialising is all done outside. Rooms are excellent, spacious and clean. but that is not what makes this hotel so good it is the staff everywhere. A smile goes a long way and as mainly only the office staff speak English you never feel lost but rather treated. as an honoured guest ( which you are) . The 6 Women working the front office are outstanding and with smiles ,suggestions, laughter, cups of tea and useful advice, showcased all that is good about being Chinese. Ying and Celine went above the call of duty and we would love to have them teaching customer service to our countrymen. Book early to get in as it runs at a 95 % occupancy rate. Thanks Red Wall Garden you were great.\nRoom Tip: All Good. We had the 2 room Western Suite on the 4 th floor - Great See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:28:57.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
