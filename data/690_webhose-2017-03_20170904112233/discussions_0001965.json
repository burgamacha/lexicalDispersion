It was very clean, with room under the bed for luggage, there was even a hairdryer and iron, along with a safe and fridge. Pity there was no kettle, but I had already read this so we took our own.\nAll the staff we came across were friendly, helpful and knowledgable (especially the Doormen)\nThe drinks in the Bar were dear but only about the same as decent restaurant prices. Also people were complaining that the hotel and rooms were dark, yes they were but that just added to the ambience and you can turn the lights on in your room and move them for more light. The windows were hard to open but it makes a change to find a Hotel where you can open the window and don't have to rely on the air con.\nWe would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to others.\nRoom Tip: Ask at reception about free wifi areas See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:00:27.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
