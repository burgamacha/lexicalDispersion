This was our third trip to the hotel. Everything was how you expect it to be. Good value for money, friendly staff, quick and easy to get. Parking is not on site but you can park in Car park A which is right next door (a bit of a nightmare to get into this time due to road works and diversions). It cost us Â£6.50 for 24 hours which is quite reasonable for London prices. We had a quiet room on the sixth floor. No view - just the to of the car park - but never mind it was fine. Breakfast was typical Premier Inn. Lots of choice. Friendly staff. What more could you ask for. Will I come again? Of course!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:20:06.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
