Keisha, Jennifer, Henry...everybody we came across was just super friendly and outgoing. They even had some balloons with cookies and milk waiting for us in the room. They all went above and beyond to make our families stay in the city memorable. The rooms are a little small and dated (doing some construction to upgrade), but it was more than enough for our family of 4. The breakfasts were a great way to start each day and the staff in the dining area went above and beyond (they even cut some fresh strawberries for my daughter). The location is centrally located in Manhattan and it's easy to walk and take subways to all the major attractions in the city. It's all about the people and this property was an A+ for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:59:21.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
