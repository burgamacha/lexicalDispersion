We highly recommend it and look forward to returning! Nicolas and the concierge team are wonderful and helped get us great tables at very popular restaurants. The hotel staff was friendly and could not have been more accommodating. The chocolate croissants at breakfast may have been the best we had during our visit. And the rooftop restaurant has a magical view of the Eiffel Tower. When one stays at a place like the Peninsula, one has high expectations. Happy to report those expectations were met and exceeded!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:04:33.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
