The hotel is in the center of Beijing with easy walking access to all major tourist areas, restaurants and shopping. The hotel is very well managed with guests attended to promptly and professionally at all times (with a smile!). In fact the staff go the extra mile when taking care of a request or a problem. It is worth staying in an executive room as the executive lounge is excellent serving a great breakfast in the morning and coffee, tea, etc throughout the day with great views of the city. The hotel also has a Morton's steak restaurant which serves one of the best steaks in Beijing. It is expensive, however so worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:19:37.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
