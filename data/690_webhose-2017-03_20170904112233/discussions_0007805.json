The location made the whole trip so easy. 3 minutes from Victoria station and 2 minutes from the station meant we spent nothing on cabs and wasted no time.\nWe had an apartment which was 1 king size bed and a sofa bed in the lounge. Small kitchenette too!\nWe found the room perfect and exactly what we needed. A separate shower would have been nicer, I'm never a fan of showering in the bath. Room are spacious too!\nStaff were all lovely and housekeeping delivered extra towels very quickly indeed.\nI would 100% stay here again and really enjoyed my time here.\n(We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we decided to have breakfast elsewhere as it was a nice Sunday morning)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:43:48.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
