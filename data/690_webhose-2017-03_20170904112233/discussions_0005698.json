It's a few minutes walk to the tube. Less than ten minutes to McDonalds. Parking is Â£10 a day - pity it's not included in the price but to be fair it's a decent price for London. We had breakfast on the first morning which was not too bad. The room was nice and we certainly had great night's sleep. (apart from my snoring apparently!?). One night we had a minor emergency and have to say that the duty manager who dealt with our issue was brilliant and his help was much appreciated. Would definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:34:23.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
