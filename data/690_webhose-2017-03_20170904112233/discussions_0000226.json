It seems a little unfair to single out any one member of staff as they were all great, but I think Steven the Doorman probably deserves a mention.\nWe were very lucky to be upgraded to the Kensington Suite, which is simply wonderful, including a lounge downstairs and mezzanine bedroom/bathroom above. Despite overlooking the gardens and the busy road, I was not disturbed by traffic noise in the slightest (the first time in many stays in London!).\nIn terms of food we only tried the breakfast - a lovely eggs benedict cooked to order from the menu, plus a wide range of cereals, breads and fruit. The afternoon tea options appeared extensive and something we may try next time we stay.\nTo summarise this was a beautiful hotel with great staff providing stunning service from start to finish. The high TripAdvisor rating is well deserved and on this evidence should be safe for many years to come.\nRoom Tip: Beautiful views from the front rooms overlooking Kensington Gardens See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:10:57.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
