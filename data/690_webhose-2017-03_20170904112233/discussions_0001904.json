View is great from the terrace. Rooms are a decent size for NY (on our kind of budget anyway) with comfy beds and spacious bathrooms. The bar has a roaring fire and massive sofas and was very busy with a young crowd in the evenings. We didn't try the hotel restaurant or breakfast as there were so many super cafes and restaurants in the local area. We walked miles and slept soundly, but there is some road noise that may bother lighter sleepers.\nRoom Tip: Higher up rooms probably quieter.
