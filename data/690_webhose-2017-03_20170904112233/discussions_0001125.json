I couldn't imagine a better location or setting within walking distance to all the beauties of Rome. It's a beautiful building overlooking the stunning Pantheon. We felt welcomed the moment we arrived by the friendly reception staff and 2 couples from our party were offered a free upgrade to the top floor where the rooms have balconies but even the standard room was impressive with a view over the square. The rooms have everything you could need and are beautifully decorated and comfortable, they were even better than the photos! Breakfast was good and they always found a table for our party of 6 even if it meant setting a new one up in the Bar. My fianc√© particularly enjoyed the pancake machine! They also had hotel umbrellas you could borrow for the rainy weather which I thought was a lovely touch. Don't look anywhere else as you won't find better than this, we have all stayed at different hotels before separately and this hotel tops them all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:15:02.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
