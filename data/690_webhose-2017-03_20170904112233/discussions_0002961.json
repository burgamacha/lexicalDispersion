They are very friendly, accommodating, and really go the extra mile.\nWe arrived way too early in Paris, and check-in wasn't until 14:00. After calling them at 7 in the morning, they told us to come to the hotel so we could drop our suitcases there while we enjoy the city. They helped us even further by stating that we could check in at 10:00.\nThe rooms themselves are a bit small, but very clean and tidy. There's a safe in the room for your things, two complementary bottle of water, and the breakfast is good as well. The wifi works well in the entire hotel. Near to the metro station where you can be all over Paris in minutes.\nDefinitely recommend this hotel!\nRoom Tip: Go for a higher floor, away from the main road See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:08:34.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
