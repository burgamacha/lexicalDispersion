What made it all the more wonderful was our stay at the London Pullman.From the moment we arrived we were looked after by the most excellent, friendly, efficient and simply fantastic staff. Every single person we encountered was so so helpful & friendly. It was my girlfriend Lynn's birthday, which we mentioned on arrival, after we were asked the reason for our stay in London. On our first night we went out to a restaurant. On our return we came back to a beautiful plate of fruit & macaroons with a lovely hand written message from Alin (who had checked us in on arrival). This was such a nice thing to do and I am glad we saw him on our last day, just before we checked out so that we could pass on our thanks and gratitude. So thank you Alin and indeed ALL of the staff at London Pullman for making our stay so memorable and enjoyable. You are all a credit to the Hotel and your customer service of the highest possible level shone through. Just great. All of you. We will be back, of that there is absolutely no doubt.\nThank you all\nStephen & Lynn\nGlasgow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:44:03.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
