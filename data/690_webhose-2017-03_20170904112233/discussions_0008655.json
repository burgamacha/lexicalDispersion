On top of that we got complimentary cheesecake and cookies for a happy birthday gift for my wife.\n*The only downside about the Hotel I would say is the cleanliness of the room, dusty lamp shades, cupboards and vents.\nI would like to say a special mention to Teddy and Jason who are the hotel concierges. These two helped me lot, they showed us local places in NY to eat and shop. Also sorted out all my transfers to the airport. So if you visiting the W keep out for these two.
