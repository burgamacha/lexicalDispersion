The location is in a very cute, fun neighborhood with lots of food options and great access to public transportation (metro, bus, or taxi). The rooms were a bit small, but being in Europe of course, we expected that and would not take a star away because of it. The rooftop was open even though the bar up there was closed for the winter. Got some great photos with our daughter standing in the view of the sparkling Eiffel Tower at night. The staff were so nice and spoke very good English, which was important to us because we are not fluent in French. On our last day, we arranged a shuttle to take us to the airport for our departure (Orly) but the shuttle did not arrive on time. The concierge got us a taxi immediately and saved the day. A great hotel and we would definitely stay there again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:53:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
