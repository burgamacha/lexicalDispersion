Very happy with our stay. Hotel is clean, functional and our room (325) relatively quiet. Everything we could need, including wifi was available in the room.\nSpecial mention to Reception staff, especially Camel, who was fantastic; he helped us choose a pub for an evening meal - his recommendation was faultless. We had an excellent meal at The Dove and a lovely walk along the riverside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:53:10.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
