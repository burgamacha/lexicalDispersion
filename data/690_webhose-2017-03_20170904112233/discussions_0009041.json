I felt that I was making a pretty good choice. Now that I've completed my stay I'm convinced that it was actually a great choice. Citadines Trafalgar Square is situated blocks from some of the best tourist attractions London has to offer. I was within walking distance of Trafalgar square and the National Museums. I was also minutes from The London Eye, Big Ben, the House of Parliament, Leicester Square, Covent Gardens and Piccadilly Circus. The hotel was kept clean and my suite was very spacious. The Front Desk staff are friendly and were eager to assist where they could. I encountered no problems with the Wifi and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a \"Handy Phone\" for my personal use upon checking into my room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.\nRoom Tip: I believe all the suites were good choices See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:17:46.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
