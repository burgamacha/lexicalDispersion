Less than 5 minutes to Printemps, Galeries Lafayette, Madeleine and Gare St.Lazare with several metro lines.\nVery good hotel for 3 stars, nice design, everything is clean. Room is small (as in most hotels in Paris), but well equipped. Bathroom is nice and of a good size. Quite good wardrobe, hairdryer is not bad, good bed.\nBreakfast room is small, but you can find quite a good variety of food, fresh juice and good coffee. And if you wake up too late to have a breakfast at the hotel, you can find a good Paul store/cafe very closely and take breakfast there.\nStaff is helpful. Wifi works well. They offer shower gel, shampoo and soap as free toiletries.\nSomething to improve:\nRoom windows face the street where every morning very early there are guys coming to take away the garbage from big litter-bins, and they make super big noise for 15-20 minutes. It is hard to fall asleep again after it. And then you can hear all the noises from the street (motorcycles, people shouting etc.).\nWould be great to have some more space for storage in the room.\nIt is forbidden to store food in the minibar, which is a pity, as sometimes you one can really need this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:01:13.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
