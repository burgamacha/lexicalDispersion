Upon arriving at the hotel I was met by a very friendly team who after a long day of work and travel just made me feel relaxed and welcome and were able to offer me an upgrade to my room (which is always appreaciated). The room itself was fantastic, very clean, quiet, and well equiped. The hotel is a conversion of an old bank and to me at least is done in a way where the general layout and architecture has not been compromised but offers a feeling of both old and new and definitely a welcome change to the typical modern hotel.\nOveral I loved staying at this hotel, the staff are great and go out of their way to help you, the hotel is stunning and just adds to the overal experience when visiting Paris.\nWould recomend to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:54:24.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
