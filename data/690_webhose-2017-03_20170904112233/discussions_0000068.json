New updated rooms and great showers. Had a jr suite on 6th floor with two balconies. Staff was extremely helpful with directions, advice for dining and very pleasant. Metro station is a block down the street and is a great way to travel to all destinations around the city. Beware of pickpockets so only bring an ID and one credit card in your front pocket and store your other valuables in the room's safe. If I travel to Paris again I would definitely stay at this boutique 20 room hotel. Eat at Lou Bistro down the street... reservations required as it fills quickly.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:59:22.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
