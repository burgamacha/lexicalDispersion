Moreover, the centre of Paris itself could be reached in about 30/40 mins walk (we decided to walk all the time so that we could make the most out of the city), but buses and a metro stop just a minute from the property can take you wherever you want. Also, very convenient location for the Paris Direct/ Charles de Gaulle /Orly Direct bus stop, just about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. As for the hotel itself, we found it really nice, comfortable, clean, fresh, nice smelling...it is really a gem in Paris and at a very affordable price. Staff were super kind and always available to accommodate our requests, e.g. extra towels, leaving our luggage in the hotel at check out since we were catching a late flight home. They were always smiling despite working long shifts (you could see that at the end of the day they were getting a bit tired!), but I think in this hotel they really got what customer services should be like! I would like to offer some advice to travellers who are wishing to travel to Paris and to book into the hotel: 1) I recommend having breakfast in the hotel. Since we thought it was a bit pricey (12 Euros per person), we decided not to have breakfast in the hotel on the first day, but we noticed that in most of cafes in town breakfast costs around 9 Euros each and you only get a coffee and a croissant for that price… whereas in the hotel for just a little more you get to eat so many delicious things from the buffet, you can refill as long as you like. We were happy that we chose to have breakfast in the hotel on the second day, and we wished we had done the same on the first day, too! 2) We booked the smallest room available (comfort double room) … it is quite small indeed! It worked out perfectly for us given that we were always out and about exploring the city, but if you prefer to spend more time in the room perhaps you should book one of the bigger rooms available in the hotel. Another minus is that the rooms have carpets, but again for us it was not a problem!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:21:12.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
