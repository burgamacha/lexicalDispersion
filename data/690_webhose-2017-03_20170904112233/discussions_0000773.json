The Cambria is located very close to Times Square. The staff is super-friendly - I have stayed earlier in NY, but such a personal approach I never experienced before. All is very clean (at least for US). I was very positively surprised - plus the price was really reasonable.\nI really can recommend this hotel. Even if my room was with no view at all (ok, I had a window, but it was no good view - no sky, no sun) - and also the furniture was quite dark. Still,I could make my own coffee in the morning. The bathroom was very clean. When I will be travelling to New York the next time - it will be for sure to this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:17:58.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
