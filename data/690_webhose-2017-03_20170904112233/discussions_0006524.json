Good concession in foyer for snacks and coffee. Brekkie a bit expensive at $35 per person. We went to green apple about 50m north on broadway and both had coffee and cooked breakfast for about $8 each.\nIf you want a cab DONT get in one outside the stopping area for the hotel- they dont come up the ramp for a reason. Get the concierge to hail one and they are safe and dont rip you off. Wifi not great but free.\nMega busy hotel at all times. But its location is awesome. Next door to hershey's world times square. It doesn't get any better.\nRoom Tip: ask for a times square view - more noise but great view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:19:31.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
