On arriving at our hotel around 2pm we thought we wouldn't be able to check in as I heard it was 3pm check in. Staff were friendly and checked us in straight away.\nLift came straight away as we were on the 18th floor. Got to our room, it was a bit small but you don't come to New York to spend all day in ur room. Bed was very comfy!!!\nThere was a noise from outside like a generator noise and I hardly slept on the first night as I'm a light sleeper, the next day we asked to move rooms due to this and staff happily helped us to do so straight away.\nWe got moved down to the 7th floor, could still hear the noise in the room but it wasn't as loud. Slept fine rest of the holiday. The room was much bigger than the first, Bed still as comfy!\nHotel is in a great location close to main attractions and sites. New York is a Fab city and I'd deffo come back and stay in this hotel.\nOverall we had a pleasent stay and wished it was for longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:26:05.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
