Room was very nice. Bed was comfortable. Shower very good. Made extensive use of the public spaces in the lobby, which was a lot of fun. Good atmosphere. Good people watching. We had drinks and played games - scrabble, chess - and people watched. Bar service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The public gathering spaces on the first floor were needed, as the room, while very comfortable and nicely appointed, was too small to comfortably entertain a guest. Not a problem for us, but guests should be aware that the rooms are a great place to sleep, but not big enough to hang out with friends. Great location on the upper west side, where it can be difficult to find a nice hotel, and the price was extremely reasonable. No noise from other guests. Could hear street noise, but you're in Manhattan. That's going to happen. If you were wanting to sleep late on a weekday, the street noise might be a problem. Otherwise, it was just local color, part of being in the big city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:24:00.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
