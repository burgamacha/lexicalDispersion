Very large suite bathroom had a separate toilet and a bathroom with full bath and separate shower. Huge comfortable kingsize bed a single bed and pull out extra bed. Blackout blinds and very quiet with no traffic noise. Security in the hotel is good and there is a Safe in room. Coffee machine in room and big television was a bonus We were 3 adults so this was excellent value for money. We didn't have breakfast as that was expensive. The train station, cash machine and a mini supermarket and a few bars are 5 minutes walk away along a pavement to the side of a main road.\nParking was cheaper if you ask at the ibis right next door-10 euro with ibis 18 euro with Novotel and it's the same parking area. We had a transit van and it was useful to get off the road and the parking was high enough for our van\nThe only negative I can say is the hotel breakfast was expensive and they dont serve draft beer and they have no cider- not even a bottle. This area has a lot of refugees but they don't hassle you - don't be scared to walk past, they are nice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:10:17.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
