The hotel is a lovely art deco hotel, feels small and homely, but clean and comfortable. The staff were really friendly and attentive, both during our stay and after we had left, when some of our packages had not arrived, they made several trips to fedex to send them on to us.\nNothing seemed too much, and all staff from Bellman to housekeeping were polite and friendly.\nThe location is great, and food at the restaurant delicious.\nI gave it a 4 star because the room was a little small ( although I know this is new york) and it would have been nice to have had a coffee machine in the room, but this is a minor point. The complimentary waters were very welcome and the turn down service chocolates delicious!\nI would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:53:27.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
