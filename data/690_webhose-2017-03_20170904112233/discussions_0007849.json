We were upgraded to a superior room on the 5th Floor and it was lovely. Had great views over the city and a great bathroom. Very modern and spacious and clean.\nExcellent check in staff lovely and fantastic location being 2 mins from Aldgate tube.\nHotel is at start of Brick lane so obvious choice for evening was a curry and it was really good. Best hotel I have stayed in London - usually have to stay on outskirts to afford anything as nice as this.\nBreakfast very good choice and relaxing.\nRoom Tip: 5th floor great views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:46:00.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
