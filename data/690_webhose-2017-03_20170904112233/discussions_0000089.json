The room was a corner king with a sofa bed and was nice and spacious. A little dated, but clean. The restaurant was closed and we also weren't told about the discount at the Times Square Diner (mentioned by a previous reviewer - I obviously should have read these before we went) - where we ended up for breakfast and paid full price. We returned to the room mid-day and it hadn't been made up yet, but a lovely housekeeper was willing to come make it up while we took a short walk - we came back an hour later and it was done. Wish I had gotten her name - she was super. Overall, good service, very friendly people, great location - good choice for a weekend in New York.\nRoom Tip: Corner rooms are bigger and have a sofa bed See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:40:32.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
