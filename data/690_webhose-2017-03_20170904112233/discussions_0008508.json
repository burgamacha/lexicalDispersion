I love walking and admiring the attractions and the culture of any city. That's why this hotel has marvellous location, just a few blocks away from the city's symbol- the Eiffel Tower. It is right next to a Market Street in Paris where one can see the typical outdoor French cafes. The hotel is quite small, but very good for a short stay if one wants to spend more time outside in the centre of Paris.\nRoom Tip: Location to kill for, excellent accessibility to Paris city centre See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:04:18.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
