When the hotel knew it was our anniversary they upgraded us and gave us some free champagne - incredibly generous. Our room was so nice and the bed was HUGE - probably the biggest bed I've stayed in, in New York. Great decor, very modern and the food we ordered from the restaurant was great, all be it, a little pricey. Great value for a wonderful room in an underrated area of Manhattan. Would stay again and recommend to friends!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:11:49.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
