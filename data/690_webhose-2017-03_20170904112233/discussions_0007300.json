The hotel is a bit smaller than the County Hall Hotel, about 100 yards away. It feels a bit more homely somehow. Our room was on the ground floor. It was spacious, clean and equipped to the usual \"Premier\" standard. There was however a small amount of traffic noise at rush hour, but it didn't bother us much. The bathroom was roomy, very clean and has a large walk in shower - great!!\nAll the reception staff were excellent - friendly and knowledgeable. All the staff were nice and helpful especially the young French waitress - didn't manage to catch her name. Breakfast was excellent and there was a wide choice of items at the \"all you can eat\" buffet. If you wanted the kitchen staff would do boiled eggs, poached eggs, omelettes or porridge.\nAll in all I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:24:57.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
