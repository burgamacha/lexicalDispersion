The guys at check in do a very nice job of quickly getting you checked in. They provide all the important information for the hotel: room number, any amenity, like WiFi, breakfast information, roof bar. Then they set you on your way.\nThe room I had was very well done. They operate rooms on the Dewey decimal system, which I found very charming. My room was architecture, so the room was filled with those books. Good size room (I got the queen bed room). Bathroom was nice as well.\nThe room felt very clean and neat.\nOnly negative is that the TV in the room was very small. But given the overall quality of the room, and my short stay, it was not an issue.\nI would like to spend a longer stay at the hotel to experience it more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:24:51.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
