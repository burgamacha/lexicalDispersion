It is a 15 minute walk to the center of town. Ask for a room in the tower as it is newer. Rooms are large and quiet. Security is good. Afternoons & evenings out back on the lawn is where the action is. There was live music or a DJ each evening which added to the energy. Breakfast is buffet with made to order eggs & omelets---good service. The concierge desk staff are very helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:52:29.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
