Can't believe we were so lucky to find a hotel with a a great suite available so close to Christmas. Situated within a 5 minute walk to the tower, the view was amazing.\nWe had a junior suite on the second to top floor, and the view was stunning. We were sceptical as others had said the view was obstructed, but we were able to sit and stare straight in front of us at the light show on the tower every hour.\nThe hotel was lovely. Clean and modern. Staff were great too, even running around trying to find us Hot chocolate sachets at midnight on our return. The barman in the hotel bar was just lovely as my daughter knocked all our drinks and snacks, he cleaned up the lot without making her feel embarrassed and also provided us with free replacements. The suite was great...yes, not the biggest we've stayed in but the lounge with the sofa bed was perfect for my daughter. You just pulled the Sofa out and it was completely made already. Only one criticism was the separate toilet and bathroom, the bathroom was ok sizewise but the toilet was teeny!!! My husband is a slim 6ft5' and it was very tight! Oh, and could do with more coffee pods for the lovely home from home nespresso machine.\nWe didn't eat in the hotel as there were so many places to est so close and we were up early and back late. Great bars and restaurants nearby.\nA 'must do' sit he cruise on the Siena. We did it after our evening meal at about 10pm...it was fantastic as there were not many people on it and we were able to wander around taking photos etc, but the sights/buildings were stunning when all lit up.\nRoom Tip: If budget allows, definitely go for suites which are on top floors.
