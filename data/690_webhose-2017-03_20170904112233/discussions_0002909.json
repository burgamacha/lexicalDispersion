It is a small boutique hotel which has been recently refurbished. The decor is modern, but that means there is plenty of storage space and the electric outlets are conveniently located. The bed was a true king size and very comfortable. As said in the title, the shower is fantastic. Great water pressure, plenty of hot water, great rainshower heads. The rooms were a bit small, but most are in Paris. Although our room overlooked the main street, the room was quiet. Our package had breakfast included; it was good but not worth the extra 16 euro if not included. Desk personnel were very helpful and very friendly. If the room had been a bit larger and the toilet room a bit larger, this would be a 5 star review. We will return. In fact, we aleady have a room booked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:39:04.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
