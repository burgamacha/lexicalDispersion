Absolutely amazing! Being a young couple we were wary that we would be underdressed in the evening but that wasn't the case at all. We felt like we fitted right in. The staff were amazing. the lift was spacious so loads of room for you and your suitcases. They had door staff that greeted you every time you returned to the hotel and held the doors open as you walked through. The hotel location is great. You can walk to anywhere you like. We needed our taxi voucher printing before we left for the airport and that was done for us very quickly. The bedroom and bathroom was lovely and clean. Bed and telly were huge. The pillows and bed were so comfy! Amazing lights and mirror. Also the room had air con and heating which was great. Felt completely safe at this hotel and yes you can hear Times Square but then you are in nyc so it's expected. The roof top bar was lovely with great views! This hotel is great for couples, families and business trips. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying at the knickerbocker the next time I visit New York!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:06.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
