The LOVED being able to see the river and the scenery. We paid extra for the clock tower view, which was so worth it in my opinion. THe really felt like they were in \"London\"! They are young so they loved the whole experience. The pool however, it belongs to a gym that people are members of. Not a true hotel pool experience, which was a bummer for them.
