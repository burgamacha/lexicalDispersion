This cozy hotel with modern design is located just 10 minutes walk from Termini station near the theater in a very nice and safe area. Rooms are of a good size, super clean. Front desk employees provide you with excellent customer service and are super friendly and ready to resolve your problems. Breakfast is outstanding. You can eat hot dishes, have nice cup of coffee or juice, variety of cheeses, fruits, bread, yogurts etc etc. It took us only 20 minutes of a nice a pleasant walk to Colosseum.\nRoom Tip: 4th floor with balcony overlooking the theater!
