The hotel is basic but clean and the staff are welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was good value at 6 euros. The hotel was a little noisy but then you are in a city. The area is great. The Abbesse metro is just metres away and it's a short walk (up a steep hill) to the Sacre Coeur. The area was busy but friendly with small boutique shops, supermarkets and lots of bars and restaurants. Would recommend for short stay in Paris.
