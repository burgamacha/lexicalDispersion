Once you step into the building you will feel that vintage feel that Rome has.\nYes, the rooms may seem small (not smaller than the ones in Paris or Amsterdam), but you are not in Rome to stay indoor; you are few steps away from Piazza di Spagna, we never used public transportation during our stay, you can walk everywhere.\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful, the only thing that can be improved is the breakfast - a few fresh fruit wouldn' t hurt.\nOverall - an amazing stay, I definitely recommend this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:19:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
