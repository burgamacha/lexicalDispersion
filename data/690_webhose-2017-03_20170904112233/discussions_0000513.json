In the most fascinating neighborhood of Paris, this hotel is a great value for what you get. The room was well appointed and the bed very comfortable. Everyone spoke English, thank goodness. They serve breakfast but we did not partake. Too many great pastry shops in the area. 2 blocks from a metro station and the Moulin Rouge. We visited all of Montmartre. There's so much character in this neighborhood. If you are going to Paris you should definitely think about staying here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:31:23.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
