That said, you can have a beer right round the corner or a breakfast right across the street (with a 10% discount).\nI recommend this hotel for leisure or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:46:11.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
