We've stayed in all sorts of hotels all over the world and will say that at a certain level, most of these places are similar in terms of their amenities & quality. However, what can quickly set them apart is their service. This is where our experience at teh Ham Yard absolutely soared. We've stayed at their Soho Hotel in London as well as their Crosby Street in NYC, but the Ham Yard is the best! Of course the rooms, the restaurants/bars and facilities looked and operated at the highest level. But, it was the staff, everyone from the front desk to the concierge, to the folks in the dining room and bars to the doormen who made our stay wonderful. And, it was really Fabian who made it memorable- any time my wife & I were on the property and wondering aloud \"Can we get this?\" or \"Where is...?\" Fabian would magically appear in front of us, answer the question and make whatever we needed materialize. He could've been a Leprechaun, but as he pointed out, he's Aussie! After staying in more formal places (Dorchester, Berkeley, Athaneum, Lanesborough), we have fallen in love with the Ham Yard and are actually excited to return!\nRoom Tip: junior suites offer just that bit of extra room to make your stay extra comfortable.
