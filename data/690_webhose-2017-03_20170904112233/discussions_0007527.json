Hotel is perfect location for Euston station and a great base for exploring the city. Hotel room was warm and the air con wasn't the most efficient, the windows open in the room which is fab as long as you can sleep through the traffic noise. Would definitely recommend the hotel and will visit again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:27:55.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
