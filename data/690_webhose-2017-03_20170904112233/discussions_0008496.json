It would have been excellent but for the following points.\nWould have been good to get the triple bed room booked instead of a standard double bed and single bed. Mattress was so soft I did not get any sleep and I usually crash out. Personal choice but I hate a soft mattress. Also noise from 6.00am did not help as I was in room 2 - a basement room opposite B/Fast room and probably the kitchen. Room very clean but some black mould on bathroom tiles but lighting and room decor fresh and modern. Lovely Breakfast Room and great freshly cooked breakfast plus all the usual continental items available as well\nThe staff from Reception, Breakfast and Housekeeping are excellent and very friendly. Would stay again but next time I ask for a room on a higher floor\nRoom Tip: Ground floor up I would say to avoid early morning noise from downstairs See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:13:34.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
