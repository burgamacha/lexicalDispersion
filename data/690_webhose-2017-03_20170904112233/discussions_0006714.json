We enjoy having our meals \"al fresco\" in the outdoor dining spaces. At times, it seemed \"crowded\" in the pool area even though there were only ~10 or so people out there at a time. We played golf and hiked in the nature reserve nearby. The best part of this all-inclusive experience was that we didn't have to plan anything and could really relax and take it in.
