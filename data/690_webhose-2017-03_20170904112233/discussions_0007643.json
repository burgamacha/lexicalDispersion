The hotel is just opposite STADE De France and is beside the subway station and a metro.\nWhat many reviews do not speak about is the surrounding neighbourhood. This is a high arab/african/indian neighbourhood and so we were warned to be careful re petty theft however nothing like that happened. The streets however are dirty which does not do the hotel Justice. The Hotel is on the outskirts of Paris so from the Airport is 50euros.\nHowever with access so readily available public transportation to main areas is easy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:50:40.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
