You can't beat the location-so close to a major subway hub, and also so many things easily within walking distance. Our room was nice, clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Coffee is available in the lobby each morning. We also appreciated the apples they would have our in the afternoons and water bottles in the rooms. Because we were there during the march snowstorm, we also loved the hot choclate they had out each evening!\nWe really enjoyed walking to restaurants and bars off 9th, beginning of the Hells Kitchen area. So many great options and way better prices than if you go closer to Times Square. Our two favorites were Thai Select and Scallywags Pub. Off 4oth, right by the subway entrance is Teleon cafe-wonderful option for breakfast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:57:15.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
