What can I say. Every time I have been to the city, except for once, I've stayed with Marriott. However, I keep coming back to this hotel for so many reasons.\nIt is just far out to be as 'real' as you can get in Manhattan, less touristy.\nIt is in a perfect location to get to Wall St, Battery Park (for the statue of liberty/ Staten Island ferry)\nIt is right next to the new Trade Center\nThe service is AMAZING. The staff here are a credit to the company.\nThe rooms are large, which you don't find, for the price you pay here. The rooms are exceptionally equipped, with safe/ tv/ coffee machine, full amenities in the bathroom. The beds are so comfortable. Rooms cleaned so well.\nWe had breakfast here too- this was in Bills restaurant and the menu looked quite limited. However, its american sized portions and we were so full when we left!\nThe hotel has links to the subway, numerous lines so easy to travel in to Manhattan and over in to Brooklyn/ Queens. And a short walk to the PATH station to get to NJ.\nWill continue to stay here every time I come to NYC!\nRoom Tip: Req a room overlooking the Hudson (statue of Liberty) or a corner room facing the WTC See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:46:50.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
