Staff very friendly and helpful, room small, elevator really slow, however, appalled one night when we returned around 9 pm to find that room was not cleaned. I have never stayed in a hotel to find room not cleaned. Called housekeeping for towels and to say room not cleaned only to find out they were short staffed. A vacuum was left outside our room so maybe it was the end of someone's shift for the day. Someone did bring us towels after requesting them. The person did have to return to empty our rubbish. Also, had to call earlier during stay for shampoo. Started out with three washcloths and ended up with one washcloth at the end of our stay, two little bars of soap for whole stay. Annoying that everyday we had to call housekeeping for little things. Other than those little things, very convenient hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:50:16.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
