Pricing is strange and the types of things you'd normally look for (large rooms, good service, facilities) are often not the things that hotels focus on. I found this through sofitel and needed somewhere central and interesting for one night. Arrived near midnight and it was like being welcomed into a private house - tiny lobby, tiny bar area and a very friendly night porter sitting at a similarly tiny reception. The room was incredibly comfortable and really well laid out, making the most of the space (small) but also having a lot of things that worked well - coffee, closets, writing desk, room to unpack. Really well put together. No facilities to speak of but Paris is right outside and the people who worked there were helpful and made suggestions for places to eat and how to get around most effectively. Would definitely recommend and go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:51:21.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
