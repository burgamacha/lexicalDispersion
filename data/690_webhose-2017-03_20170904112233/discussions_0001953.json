Our son turned 18 on March 11. We let him have the apartment for a sleepover while my wife and I stayed at the Roger.\nWorking with first William Rodriguez and Camille, we were given an incredible room that looked right over our building! Jen, Christine and the entire front desk staff were awesome -- as where the courteous and friendly doormen!!\nWhat a wonderful experience you created for us.\nWe shall return!!\nPS: I am Michael D. Drucker -- not Dr. Michael R. Drucker.
