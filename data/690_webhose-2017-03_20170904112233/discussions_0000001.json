This place is great! Location is perfect and as many other reviewers state, the staff is phenomenal. We were there to celebrate our anniversary and were upgraded to a suite and had a dessert and chocolates in our room when we arrived & a voucher for champagne in the bar- so nice!! The room was huge (small bathroom though) & the fact that they have drinks in the room is amazing. We enjoyed the breakfast. The hotel is very pretty, loved the dining room and the bar area. Every time we entered the lobby we were greeted by multiple people; always willing to help with directions, things to do, places to eat, etc. Every person on the staff is exceptional- I wish I could remember all of their names to thank them here! Next time we visit London, we will absolutely be staying here!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:09:07.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
