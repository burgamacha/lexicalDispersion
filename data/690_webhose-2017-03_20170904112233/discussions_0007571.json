I was greeted at the hotel and made to feel very comfortable. There is wifi throughout the hotel, so even if your room is not ready there is a comfortable lounge to wait and be able to connect. The check in process was very fast and the area is fabulous. There are projections on the wall that are great to watch - sounds odd but it is wonderful to watch. The room was nice and functional. This is a hotel that is not cookie cutter and I had a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:13:20.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
