The location is ideally close to metro stops, making all of the main sites easily accessible. Also close by are some fantastic boulangeries and restaurants, as well as the remarkable Moulin Rouge. Staff spoke perfect English and were both friendly and helpful. The hotel was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Our 'standard' double room was small but perfect for a short stay with everything we needed. We also appreciated and made good use of the free mini bar and open bar in the breakfast room. Breakfast consisted of a well presented array of local foods and was the perfect start to the day. A fantastic weekend!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:16:54.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
