I was upgraded to the Zen Suite, which has its own Jacuzzi in the bedroom - would have been fantastic for a romantic getaway, however I was on a boring old business trip, so it didn't make much sense. Very good bed, decent (but not superior) breakfast, great coffee. Staff were very friendly. All rooms come with Handy, an Android phone that is loaded with local information and that you can take out and about - with FREE internet access (including Google Maps) and free calls to six countries (including UK and US, I believe). Great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:24:20.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
