The hotel was just perfect. I wanted to stay somewhere close to the Eiffel Tower and in a very \"French\" neighborhood, not filled with traffic and huge corporate hotels. This is exactly what we got.\nThe staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. The room was very clean. It was quite small but we knew to expect that. It had everything we needed and the size just made it feel even more French! We never ate breakfast in the hotel but I am sure it was fine. We just chose to go to local bistros for breakfast to get a wider experience.\nThe hotel arranged for a car service to take us to and from the airport. They did a wonderful job.\nThe value is excellent...safe, clean, quaint, friendly and cost efficient.\nWould definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:46:20.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
