The breakfast is better to be taken in the room rather than in the restaurant since they dont offer a buffet and service is rather slow.\nHowever this hotel has great advantages.\nIt is extremely well located few minutes walk from Champs Elysees.\nThe junior suite is beautiful modern high tech.(50m)\nThe main strength of this hotel is the pool and the the fitness room situated in the spa of the hotel.\nMy visit to the fitness club has enlighten my stay especially when i met their Italian Personal trainer Alessandro Di Lorenzo After a short conversation with him , i decided to take Pt sessions.\nI even extended my stay in order to benefit from his great advices and training,. Thanks to him i recovered quickly from my injury and got more aware about my health and nutrition.\nHe is at the same time a tough and friendly coach . He is a great listener and advisor .\nThe other positive point of this hotel is the concierge team . They are highly professional ( Harrorld , Sara , Mael , karim Marianne, Maxance, especially Julien who is the wisest in the team and the most calm among all. They all helped me in organizing my weekends, gave me lovely adresses for restaurants.\nThe security in this hotel is extremely high . A special thank to Sebastien who assisted me in a very friendly way .\nThe restaurant l oiseau Blanc run by the Charismatic chef Sydney Redel\n( check my review on trip advisor) is an address not to be missed on the roof top with a great view on Eiffel tower. You need to taste the homard menu . Un pur RÃ©gal\nFinally , i highly recommend this hotel for a person who wants to have a Wellness stay not a short business trip.\nOne of the main assets in this hotel is the coach Alessandro Di Lorenzo. He has helped me a lot and gave me a program of exercises and health advices that i follow till now in my country. Thank you\nI definitely will return to this hotel to see these exceptional persons.
