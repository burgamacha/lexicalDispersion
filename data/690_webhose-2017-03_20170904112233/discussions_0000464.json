The service was fabulous. The front desk staff was very accommodating and provided good recommendations for dinner and getting around the city. We especially loved Ferry who was so helpful and courteous. I only had breakfast there and it was good and had the standard fare. There are so many places nearby that had pastries and other goodies. I can't say enough about the area. The room was spacious compared to others I had seen and was very stylishly decorated. I loved the color scheme and was very comfortable. There were three of us in the room and we had no problems fitting all of our things and moving about. There is a claw like tub in the bathroom and the bath products were L'Occitane which was a welcome treat, The location is close to many cafes/restaurants and markets. There is a lot to do in the area and it's easy to get a cab and ride the metro. The Terrass Bar was really nice and our server, Ferry, went out of his way to make our evenings memorable (and Fun) This hotel gets my vote and I will definitely be back. The only thing I would recommend is that you make reservations for dinner. We were not aware of this and twice were unable to eat dinner in our own hotel The second time they did try and accommodate us but we made other arrangements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:52:22.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
