Check in went smoothly, by a very nice English speaking gentleman. My apartment was excellent, larger than I had expected for more of a budget place in Europe. I loved having 2 table/chair sets in the room. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was quiet. Great amenities. Secured hotel door - you need either your key to get in or to buzz the front desk. Great location. Walking distance to shopping, Eiffel Tower, metro. Please note that housekeeping is on a weekly basis, but they provide enough towels and toiletries to last, along with cleaning supplies that may be needed (broom, vacuum, dishwasher tabs etc)\nRoom Tip: I always love higher floors.
