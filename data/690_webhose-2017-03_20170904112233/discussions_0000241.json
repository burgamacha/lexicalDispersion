It was an exceptional stay from start to finish. The staff is the highlight of the hotel. They are friendly and welcoming and really go the extra mile to make sure you have a great stay. The concierge was extremely helpful in booking restaurant reservations during our stay. The rooms are well appointed and quiet. We also very much enjoyed the breakfasts in the dining room and having pre-dinner drinks in the comfort of the bar by the fireplace. Overall, it was a fantastic stay and it would be, without question, our first choice the next time we are in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:56:33.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
