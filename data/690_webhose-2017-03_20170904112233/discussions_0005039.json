From the minute we entered the hotel, we were treated warmly by every staff member. The person who brought our bags to the room gave us a great description in the history of the building. From the leather embossed walls of the elevator to the beautiful original rails in the hallway to the amazing bar on the main floor, no detail was spared. A lot of money was spent here and it shows. The details are exquisite. We upgraded our room to a premium king and had a great view of Broadway and Freedom Tower. Got great night's sleep on the comfortable bed with luxurious duvet. I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and we found a bottle of wine with a handwritten birthday card in the desk of the room! Really nice gesture. Augustine was a lovely place for brunch. While the Bar Room in lobby was beautiful, I thought the staff was not too friendly and the menu choices for food and mixed drinks were just okay. I think this will be our new hotel to stay in and will definitely be recommending it to all of our friends.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:43:58.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
