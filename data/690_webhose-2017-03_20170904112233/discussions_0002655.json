The hotel is centrally located with ready access to public transportation for visiting spots in uptown and downtown. Check in was a breeze, and we immediately felt welcome and comfortable. The room was modern and exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and cleanliness. The modern decor and comfortable bed made me feel like a got a real bargain. Our room was on the 6th floor above Lexington, but the city noise didn't bother us at all. We slept like babies after long days filled with lots of sight-seeing.\nWe often try a choose hotels located away from the larger tourist areas to get a real sense of an individual neighborhood. The Lex fit the bill. Lexington Ave has plenty of small restaurants and 3rd Ave provides a wide variety of small eateries as well. The Hummus Kitchen and Penelope's which are both only 5 minutes away, and the food in little India is fantastic. We discovered a old fashioned pinball arcade right around the corner - what a fine discover indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:02.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
