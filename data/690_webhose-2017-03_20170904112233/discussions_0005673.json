I arrived early on in the day and was looking to drop my luggage of as I was quite early for check in. The gentleman who took my bags was so friendly and kind, really helpful gentleman!\nWhen I arrived back to check in we were greeted by Thibauld on reception. He informed us that our room wasn't ready due to a late check out. I was a little upset about that after travelling and walking about all day. However, he handled it well and offered us complimentary drinks at the bar and a late check out if we needed. He was polite and kind to us! As we were leaving early for check out we just used the bar facilities. Within a few minutes we were told it was in fact ready for us, so we ended up with the room ready anyway!\nWe got a premium room with a view (of the seine, not the Eiffel), which was nice. There was robes and slippers provided, a mini fridge which would be topped up for free every day & a coffee machine. This was quite a nice tough as a coffee drinker!\nThe room was clean & tidy and the bed comfortable. So overall excellent room.\nThe location was fantastic. Next to the metro to centre, next to RER C trains which you can take to an RER B trains stop to go straight to Charles De Gaulle Airport, within an hour.\nRoom Tip: Premium rooms don't cost that much extra & are quite a nice upgrade See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:37:44.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
