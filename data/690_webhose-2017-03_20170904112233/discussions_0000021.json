Difficult to fault this fantastic hotel, which should be mentioned far more often amongst London's best. The tea was superb; far too much food of course. Scones and finger sandwiches to die for and an exceptionally good array of yummy cakes. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the ambience is perfect in a gloriously traditional and old-fashioned sort of way. Very knowledgeable barman, with an obvious interest in traditional and more off the wall cocktails. The location is also great, close to all the facilities in Hyde Park and a short walk to the museums at South Kensington or the shops at Knightsbridge. Mayfair and the West End are only a little further away. Visit the Milestone and prepare to be thoroughly spoilt!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:01:32.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
