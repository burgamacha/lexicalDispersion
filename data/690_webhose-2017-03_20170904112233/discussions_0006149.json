It is still Manhattan, so that means it is still expensive, but not bad for a decent hotel. I had a double room, and there was barely any room to walk around the room. Again, standard for the area, but not for typical Garden Inns. Otherwise, the room was fine, although it didnt have a premium movie channel on TV. I had a room on the 24th floor facing south, so I did have a great view of the Freedom Tower and lower Manhattan, which was not expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:25:01.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
