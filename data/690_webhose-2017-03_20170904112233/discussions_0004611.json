Guestrooms are quite large, even all the spaces in the separate bathroom quarters. Fitness room is a good size and includes a rower. The park is so close too, to go for a quick run. Swimming pool is 19m long. Biggest complaint is you can hear everything from the hallway inside the guestroom. People talking and doors were opening and closing a lot during our stay for some reason. Highest floor in the hotel is 25 (spa, fitness).\nRoom Tip: Higher floors may have glimpse of Central Park See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:22:53.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
