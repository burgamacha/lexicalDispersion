I have stayed in almost every room type - with the exception of the Grand Suites. I travel often and stay in \"like\" hotels almost all the time, but I must admit that The Pierre is unique in its class.\nThe hotel emanates the grandeur and glitz of the 1930's which in itself makes one's experience special. However, what makes The Pierre peerless in its class is the quality of service and the attention guests receive during their stay. Throughout all my stays in the past three years every member of the staff - from the doorman to the pasty chef - did a superb job in truly making me feel at home.\nA particular story I would share is that when I once hinted (in jest) to a member of the staff that the chocolate bars stacked in the mini-bar are not my taste, in thirty minutes he returned with a chocolate tower in the shape of the Empire State Building. This is treatment one gets from his or her grandma, not a stranger in a hotel...\nI could go on for hours, suffice it to say: The Pierre is my favorite hotel in the World!\nRoom Tip: Definitely go for a City View Classic or a City View Suite See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:38:54.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
