Valeria was by far the most incredible host we have has, always greeting us with a smile as we walked in. This visit I proposed to my long term girlfriend and the hotel's kind hospitality made the whole experience incredibly pleasant.\nWe found the location ideal, being a short distance from edge ware road tube station and within walking distance of marble arch and oxford street.\nCafe 8 next door was great for breakfast as well with the discount offered. Good quality food.\nThe rooms themselves are what you pay for and while on the smaller side, for a short term stay you couldn't ask for anything more.\nLoved it, loved it staff in particular! Thank you very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:19:03.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
