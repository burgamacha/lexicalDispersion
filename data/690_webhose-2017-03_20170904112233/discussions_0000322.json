We chose it due to its high Tripadvisor ranking and the service was exactly as all the 5-star reviews described. We were upgraded to a King deluxe room that was ready an hour before check-in time. We had to wait a few minutes but we did so in the super cute stable bar (the decor is probably best described as \"equestrian AF\", haha). The room was really lovely with plenty of space and the bathroom was actually huge, especially for a London hotel. Lots of little extras:\n- The wake up call comes with a free pot of coffee or tea.\n- The turn down service dropped off a little treat every night.\n- Lovely little buns and jam was left in our room on our last night.\n- Umbrellas, slippers, robes and adapters in the room for our use.\nWe got room service breakfast on our last morning and it was good as well; we didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't vouch for that. There's also plenty of great food options within walking distance of the hotel (loved the lobster noodles at Mandarin Kitchen across the park, and had fantastic breakfasts at Egg Break in Notting Hill and Kensington Square Kitchen just a 5 min walk away).\nThere were a few funny little quirks — our morning coffee/tea would frequently arrive 10 minutes before our wake up call — but really, if the one bump is your free morning caffeine is arriving *early* with a smile...not much to quibble with! We would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:11:05.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
