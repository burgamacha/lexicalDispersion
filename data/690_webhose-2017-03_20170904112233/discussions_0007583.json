We stayed in Duplex Eiffel Tower Suite, with a breath-taking view of the Eiffel Tower. The entire hotel knew about my surprise engagement planned in the Hotel's \"Le Salon de Famille\" and played along with all the hidden aspects of the engagement to keep it a surprise.\nThe hotel itself was a treasure, extremely classic and refined. The details in the rooms and the rest of the hotel were exquisite and historic.\nWe ate at all of the three restaurants within the hotel, which were beautiful, extremely pleasant staff and very tasty food.\nThe hotel was also able to arrange sim cards for both my fiancée and I on arrival to ensure that we were able to use our mobile devices.\nThe surprise engagement went flawlessly and the entire salon was transform beautifully for the event with the hotel being very helpful in all the ways that they can and beyond.\nThis was a truly great and memorable experience and we cannot recommend this hotel more. It is something you can only experience for yourselves.\nRoom Tip: Must have Eiffel View See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:08:19.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
