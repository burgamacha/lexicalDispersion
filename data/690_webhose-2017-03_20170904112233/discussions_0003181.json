My husband and I felt like royalty from start to finish. The staff and service were impeccable! The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Each day began with a lovely breakfast and helpful suggestions for making the most of our outings. The staff was extremely knowledgeable. Each evening we returned to our room to find the fire going, candlelight and rose petals! We wanted to pack up the hotel and staff and transport them to Paris for the next leg of our journey. Hotel 41 is our new favorite place. We are forever spoiled and cannot wait to return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:53:23.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
