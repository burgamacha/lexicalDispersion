This hotel more than fits the bill. It is right next door to Les Halles, 150 meters from the Pompidou Center, 1/2 km from L'Hotel the Ville, within a km from Notre Dame, and onto the Latin Quarter from there. I walked a lot around the area which really came alive at night.\nThe room was very comfy and overlooked the square. Luckily, the windows are sound proof so I could sleep. I could smell complex yummy odors from other rooms on my floor; so I guess that the kitchen is as useful as it looks modern. The elevators work quite well and people at the lobby are multilingual and helpful. In addition to French, I heard English, Spanish, Portuguese being used.\nI stayed five days, so I got a price break. But you can be sure that the next time I go to Paris, this hotel will be on my list of places to check out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:04:56.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
