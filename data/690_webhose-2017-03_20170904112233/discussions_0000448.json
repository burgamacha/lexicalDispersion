Great location and very easy to get to all main tourist attractions via the metro. We stayed in the executive suite on the 6th floor which had private balcony and stunning views of the Eiffel Tower. Waking up to that each morning was definitely worth the money. As for the room itself it was very spacious and comfortable. Not very fancy in terms of fixtures and fittings maybe could do with a wee upgrade but overall was really nice room. All staff really pleasant and friendly and willing to help. Would recommend as a great base for exploring the city!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:32:20.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
