We found the hotel to be very modern, clean and no hassle. The co-living area was well designed and we enjoyed a coffee each night. The hotel was also very accommodating of our requests such as early check-in, bowls for breakfast and directions. We were also upgraded when we arrived. I liked the fact that it had practical amenities such as the co-living area where you can sit and enjoy a drink, meal and play some games, vending machines, children play area, gym, self service laundry etc. I felt these were modern day features that made the hotel understand its guests and cater for modern requirements.\nRoom Tip: I think ground floor rooms cost less, but we were upgraded.
