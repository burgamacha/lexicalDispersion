Easy to get to/from and nice staff. Room was fine - very small, but had what we needed. Only problem is the noise / light at night. If people arrive late / leave early you can hear them very clearly (even if they're just talking). And the door doesn't close completely so there's a lot of light from the hallway coming trough the door. However I had brought a sleep mask and ear plugs so it wasn't much of a problem to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:15:30.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
