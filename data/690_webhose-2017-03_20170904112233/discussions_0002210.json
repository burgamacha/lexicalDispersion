Only a short walk to the Eiffel Tour and easy to find. The food at the restaurant was nice although we did get a burnt steak they were happy to make a new one. Room was very clean and spacious with a beautiful of the tower. Will stay here again! The improvement I would suggest is the check in and out process. There were different queues at each counter. No queueing system in place hence people pushing in and staff getting stressed. Sadly staff did not do anything about people pushing in the queue and still served them which caused a few very unhappy customers who have queued for more than 30mins.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:59:39.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
