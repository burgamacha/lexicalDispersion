Macy's around the corner, tour bus stops close by and the subway a couple of blocks away.\nEverything was exceptional from the cleanliness, to the friendly and helpful staff on reception, housekeeping and at breakfast. (Shameeza could do with some customer service tips).\nOur room was on the 17th floor and had an amazing view, but the smaller touches made the stay, free water and tea and coffee in the lobby 24hrs, and the most important thing the breakfast. I have never stayed in a NYS hotel the breakfast before, it is not michelin star, but has everything you need to start your day and if you are on a budget it helps as the average decent breakfast is around $15, so this was perfect.\nI would definitely return and highly recommend.\nThank you for a great stay.\nRoom Tip: High floor are better.
