The room was huge in comparison with other Italian hotels. The staff was very professional, kind, and helpful. Valerio at the front desk was amazing. He speaks excellent English, which was very helpful. He took a lot of time to explain all the various tour options to us, gave us recommendations, and even offered to reschedule one of our tours that we had previously booked in order to accommodate another tour. After observing a lack of customer service in many Italian establishments, Valerio was a wonderful surprise and an excellent concierge!\nThe restaurant staff at breakfast were also amazing! The waiters named Juan Carlos and Luigi were extremely friendly and went out of their way to make sure our breakfast was perfect every morning. Their service was top notch! We would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:26:45.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
