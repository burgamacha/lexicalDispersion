We chose the hotel because of its location and value for money. The reception staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The hotel is relatively small and compact but the room we had was excellent and a good size and kept clean with fresh bed linen and towels as required.. It was nice to have tea and coffee facilities in our room which we wouldn't normally expect in a European hotel. The breakfast was self-service but had a great variety of foods including eggs, bacon and sausages. The lady in charge of the breakfast area was pleasant and helpful and ensured that there was plenty of freshly available food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:46:21.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
