Very nice place, well maintained and friendly staff. Two minutes walk to La Defense metro station. But Uber drivers found it very difficult to come to the location and each time I had to call the drivers and have them talk to this hotel staff to explain. Rooms are very well appointed, clean and comfy beds. The house keeping can be improved, they never refilled the in room coffee, creamer packs. The executive lounge was super.. Lots of space for one to find a quiet corner to work. Andrea, was very helpful. Limited snack choices for vegetarians, just bread and cheese, salad. Overall a great stay..", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:24:30.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
