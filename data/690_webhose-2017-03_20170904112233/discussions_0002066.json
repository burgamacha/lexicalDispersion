A copy of the reservation taken into front desk upon arrival showed me that the hotel does not have an executive lounge. The rooms are dark, small and mysterious. My room faced the alley but it was much quieter than the rooms facing main floor. Had a choice between an attic room or a room with a separate section near the bathroom with a desk. Room had a balcony access where you climb up thru the windows to get into the balcony, felt alot like an Audrey Hepburn movie set during of her songs. The bathroom was dim, not well lit, but electronic buttons control the shades and you can control the outer light. Toilets were controlled with many buttons (very japanese-like). The floors are dark, the shower is large, the sink small. All in one area no barriers. The room comes with a great pillow menu, I would say in all of my travels the pillows in the room were by far the best I have ever had and truly my sleep showed it. Dark out curtains just kept me in bed longer ... Oh oh Paris, here I come.\nRoom Tip: High floor, and see a few rooms before you decide.
