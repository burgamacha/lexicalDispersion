So, this trip was for a birthday celebration for my friend. We checked in Saturday and stayed the night. The receptionist were friendly and ensured everything was taken care of. When I booked the room over the phone the receptionist asked if I was celebrating anything, I responded yes, my friends birthday. She proceeded to tell me that she will give us a complimentary bottle of champagne! Hooray! When I arrived to the room I ensured to take pictures before I got settled. The bottle of champagne was not there, but I called the front desk and they brought it up. The room had two queen size beds, a very tiny bathroom, TV, minibar and white rob for the birthday girl. I would have to say that the best part of the trip was the surrounding places. The restaurants,karaoke, and other activities. We went to Buddakan for dinner then to Karaoke at Duet 35. What a great night! Then we went back to the hotel and popped the bottle of Champagne to celebrate my friends birthday. When it came time to check out, a few extra dollars was added to the bill but I endured to have the removed. (It's the principle that counts, don't add more money that wasn't discussed when booking) Overall, I had an outstanding time. Oh, I almost forgot the beds are so comfortable! Ok! That's all! Pictures to follow.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a nice view.
