Catalina was at the reception desk and found us a nice room with a King bed, already made up and we got checked in in just a few minutes. She explained about the hotel and amenities and gave us a map of Paris and explained where we were in relation to the main attractions. She escorted us to our room and explained everything to us. She was extremely helpful and gave us a wonderful reception. During our stay, the room was good size, the bathroom was very nice and we never had any issues. The bed was a bit more firm than we are used to, but still quite comfortable. We used the wifi each night and it was very good. Although there are no ice machines on the floors, when ever we wanted ice, we could call the front desk and they would send a nice bucket of ice within minutes. The room had a small refrigerator and microwave as well. The hotel is quite close to the Metro and only a 15 minute walk from the Eifel Tower and maybe 15 to 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triumph. We would definitely stay here again if in Paris. Thanks for a wonderful stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:35:47.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
