It's super close to the metro giving you access to all parts of the city. It is also within walking distance of many other attractions including a 7minute walk to Notre Dame. Rooms and clean and service was very friendly. The rooms come with cute balconettes and the design of the room is modern and fun. The hotel provides a light breakfast of croissants, juice, and coffee in the morning. Would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:37:59.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
