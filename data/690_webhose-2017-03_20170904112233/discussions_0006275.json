Beautiful hotel with a modern design. Exceptionally clean with a very professional staff. Well run and located within walking distance of all tourist sites including the main train station. We felt safe walking in all directions around the hotel. Wonderful breakfast to start your day with a great staff attending to your every need. The hotel sits on a busy street but our room was located within so it was quiet therefore no view out of the room just a view of an inner courtyard. The rooftop restaurant is nice but we didn't choose to eat there because there are so many nice local restaurants nearby. We did take a taxi to the Vatican to make it to Sunday's 12:00 Mass but walked it back stopping at sites on the way. The staff make this hotel a great place to stay, very friendly and accommodating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:57:35.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
