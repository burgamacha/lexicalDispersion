It was sold to us as a 4 star hotel in a good location by our travel agent.\nOn arrival we thought great location as right across from penn station which we arrived into after our flight to Newark.\nWe were given a one bedroom standard room and were fairly disappointed with it being our honeymoon. The impressive reception area was not reflected by the tired room that was in need of some care.\nThe next morning I checked the room account on the screen and found I was being charged for the room also, despite having paid upfront via the travel agent so went to reception with my paperwork. There we met with Diesel who was excellent and was apologetic. Without prompting he said he would have that cleared up and upgraded us to an apartment room which was twice the size with mini kitchen and living room space! We were not looking for anything so we're delighted. Room was spotlessly clean and delighted with it. Only reason I haven't gave 5 stars is bathrooms are a little tired but given we are out and about seeing NYC and it is spotlessly clean we are delighted with hotel and it's central location.\nThanks to diesel at reception for making this a great stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:27:11.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
