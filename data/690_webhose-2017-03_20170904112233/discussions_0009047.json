I stayed in two rooms, a ground floor large single (which could probably just about house 2 people for a single night) accessed through their cafe, and then upstairs for a double room at the back,.\nStaff are friendly and super helpful. It's a great location, right beside Borough tube (Northern line) or about 5 minutes walk from London Bridge (fast Jubilee and Northern line) tube, or about 10 minutes walk from the City of London. I like that you get real high quality soft and fresh towels, a comfortable bed, and decent water pressure.\nIt is very clean. Good wifi. Great value for where it is. I've paid 2x the room rate to stay over the Thames. Lots of late night shops and restaurants close by.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:41:05.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
