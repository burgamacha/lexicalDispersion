This hotel definitely fit the bill. Anyone familiar with Relais & Chateaux will know that all of their properties are unique and have the feel of individually-owned hotels. This hotel is a few minutes walk from the Arc du Triomphe and an inexpensive taxi ride from all of the main attractions.\nOn arrival we were greeted by smiling faces (not to be taken for granted in Paris!) and given a tour of the hotel. We'd booked a junior suite but were upgraded to a large 2 room suite instead. The room was beautifully decorated. We later had a wonderful meal in the Michelin star restaurant and over the course of the 3 nights enjoyed a few cocktails in the Library bar. The bar is wonderful and cosy. I imagine that in the warmer months the outdoor seating area would be lovely. Although there is no pool we did enjoy some lovely treatments in the spa, which I thought were very reasonably priced.\nOverall, if you want to enjoy some luxury in Paris this is perfect. Obviously there are less expensive options, but if you want to splash out (but splash out less than the Ritz!) come here instead. We'll definitely stay again if we come to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:07:52.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
