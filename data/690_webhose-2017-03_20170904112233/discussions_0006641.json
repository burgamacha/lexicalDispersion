I'm telling you! I've stayed at several hotels in the city in this price range. The Walker has a warm lobby to come home to after a cold snowy day, cozy beds, kind staff, perfect location, and quiet rooms! Our room was across from the elevator on the 12th floor, but we never heard a peep!\nThere is a quaint gourmet Italian restaurant across the street that I recommend -and other nearby shopping, drug stores and restaurants!\nI will definitely return!!!\nJust a note: no in-room fridge or coffee maker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:53:16.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
