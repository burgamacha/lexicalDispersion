Although all have some positives, none offered everything that I wanted until I found the Holiday Inn Manhattan-Financial District!\nThe hotel is always clean and welcoming with spacious rooms and beautiful views, its location offers easy access to several forms of transportation, its price point is consistently competitive for its area, and its staff is always friendly and very helpful. Avinash, Cesar, and Tricia, especially, have gone out of their way to make my stays very comfortable.\nIf you are looking for a hotel at the south end of Manhattan that takes great care of you at affordable prices, this is the hotel!\nRoom Tip: Rooms on the northwest offer great views of both the Hudson and the World Trade Center site.
