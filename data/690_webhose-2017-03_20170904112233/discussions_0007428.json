Reception was incredibly helpful - provided an umbrella on a particularly rainy day, and helped me get in contact with my airport shuttle service when it was late on departure. Exceptional bakery just minutes down the street was great for a quick breakfast. Very close to one of the main metro stations. Very cute room, that included a towel warmer which definitely came in handy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:33:27.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
