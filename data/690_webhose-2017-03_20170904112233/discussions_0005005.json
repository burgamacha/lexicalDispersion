It is expensive but deservedly so. We received a lovely welcome and were shown round the property by Riccardo who is amazing - discreet but never far away to make sure you have anything and everything you need. The room was huge with quality bed linen, huge bed and a terrace at the front with courtyard/sea view and another at the rear. Luxurious bathroom with claw foot bath and large shower. Staff were all polite and all seemed to be very happy in their work, nothing too much trouble. Location is fantastic and cliff walk to Hermanus (about 1 hour) great with amazing plant life, exotic birds and dolphins in the bay. The hotel picked me up for a lift back but my partner returned on foot. All meals were included - breakfast, lunch and dinner - all excellent apart from a few things on dinner menu but there is a choice. Maybe for the price they could include better quality ingredients mainly in the starters. We only stayed two days and wish we had booked more. We will definitely return for longer next trip.\nRoom Tip: Sea View is a must!
