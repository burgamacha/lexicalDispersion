It is cheaper than hotels that are more central located but also with quite new rooms and usual Premier Inn comfort. The staff there is very friendly, no matter who. Unfortunately, only free Wifi is available and it is very poor, although I have been already in four different rooms, so it's not a distance to router issue. As the area around the hotel is well-known for its pubs and restaurants you should also expect not always to meet completely friendly people on the streets outside, so keep that in mind especially when bringing kids. Overall Brixton is a very lively district though and I like it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:29:20.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
