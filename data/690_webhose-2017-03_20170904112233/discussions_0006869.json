For Manhattan, this place is a steal. Although the lobby is practically non-existent, the room was large (by NYC standards). The room was immaculate, cleaned thoroughly everyday, and had all the amenities that you need. The wood floors and marble bathroom were a nice touch. Breakfast was next store at Cafe Silo which was w y better than what you get at most hotels. A full hot meal that was so filling that we skipped lunch a couple of days. The location is a block away form the subway and a 5-6 minute walk from Macy's. I highly recommend this hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:30:43.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
