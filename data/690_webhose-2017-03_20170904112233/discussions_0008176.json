We came to London to watch UFC. Staff on the bar very friendly especially Eszter, Preslava and Samantha. All was great until next morning we went for a breakfast and after we want drink like a coke, beer or anything else to drink but two indian employees they refused and they said bar it's open from 12 , this is not nice because I stayed in many Hilton's before and I know that all residents have drinks 24hr. So we took out our drinks as nobody want serve us and suddenly one indian guy from reception came to us and said we can't have it and we have to wait until 12. This is so bad as one family came over also for drinks and they been told the same, child want a drink and they refused to give a drink for a kid. So bad Never seen nothing like this that you can't buy any drink before 12 on the bar. Bad experience in the morning , but day before girls from bar were very help full and positive but morning absolutely disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:15:03.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
