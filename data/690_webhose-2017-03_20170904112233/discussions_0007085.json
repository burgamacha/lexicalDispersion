Particularly Nancy on the front desk who recommended a lovely Italian restaurant for us to eat at. She also rang ahead, booked the table for us & also arranged for our dessert to be paid by the hotel which was a lovely surprise!\nThe hotel is located in a really nice part of Greenwich village with only a short walk to everything you could need.\nI would highly recommend it and would love to stay here again in future!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:48:42.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
