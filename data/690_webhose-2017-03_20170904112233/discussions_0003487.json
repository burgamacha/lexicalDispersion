It would have been better if we knew where the parking garage ahead of time but that's where the problem occurred . Unloading our luggage in front of the hotel before check-in time we left our vehicle unattended for few minutes . When my husband got back the parking police already writing us a ticket .unbelievable ! Just hoping its waived because it would be a very expensive stay .\nOther than that we like the hotel . Friendly polite staff . The rooftop bar have a great view of The Empire State Building that is beautifully lit at nite.\nThe rooms are typical NYC size . There's a complimentary continental breakfast\nIt's located in Koreatown and a short subway / Uber ride to Times Square . Lots of restaurants (Korean) and such around . Nightlife is safe . Manhattan Mall is a block away. It's easy to navigate around with a google map.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:37:11.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
