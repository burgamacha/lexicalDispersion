Stayed for three nights in March 2017. Fantastic location, area surrounded by great places for food and drinks. some great places for crepes (josselin around the corner) and relais de l'entrecote is also around the corner if you want to try some of their steak frites with their secret sauce. There is also a supermarket around the corner and the hotel is no more than a minute walk from two different metro stations!\nParis CDG to Edgar Quinet metro (hotel) took about an hour on the RER + Metro.\nThe room was lovely, a little small but great value, comfortable beds, safe, TV, minibar (Reasonably priced) and you can have a continental breakfast sent up to you room at no extra charge (we had breakfast included). The bathroom was very clean, big shower, hairdryer etc.\nCons, hard to think of any except that the rooms are a little bit small and aren't perfectly soundproofed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:27:19.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
