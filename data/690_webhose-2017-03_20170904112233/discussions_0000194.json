The only minor criticism we could make is that the room did not have a mirror which meant you had to rely solely on the bathroom mirror.\nStaff were very helpful and always on hand to answer any questions.\nTip - do not use the shuttle service, get the train into Paris this is much quicker and much cheaper (as we found out on our return journey).\nWe would definitely return to Hotel Helussi.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a balcony See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:58:59.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
