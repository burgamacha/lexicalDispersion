Prices got too crazy. So, I looked at the Milburn and a number of other hotels. Even booked rooms in all hotels, then I studied reviews. All hotels were getting mixed reviews, but we love the 75th street location, so we finally settled on this one. We are not disappointed. Large 600 sf suite. Decent little kitchenette and small bathroom. Otherwise nice beds with super linens. Nice furniture ( perhaps a little worn) in the living room Very quiet. We were on the second level facing the front. Right over the awning for the front door. If the price is right we will return in the fall. Only complaints: 1 slight musty odor in bath, which management might want to discover source. 2. Toilet was ridiculously tiny. Really?!?! Come on, this isn't Turkey. 3. No towel bars in bath. That was odd - or maybe they didn't want to drill into the marble tile.\nI recommend this hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:33:36.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
