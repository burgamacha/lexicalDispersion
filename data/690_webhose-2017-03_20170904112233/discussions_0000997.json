I was looking for a nice place to stay near Paris without spend a fortune.\nThe position of the hotel is strategic, 10 min by walk from the Metro 1 (La Defence); In 10 minutes by train you will be in the city center.\nThe hotel is small but there is everything you need for a short stay (both for business and leisure) in Paris. Rooms are cozy and pretty clean but they are missing some small amenities such toothpaste/toothbrush.\nThe breakfast I great, with a lot of choices and it's only 10 Euro per person.\nI would definitely recommend this hotel, great Value for Money.\nRoom Tip: Value for money, nice rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:27:19.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
