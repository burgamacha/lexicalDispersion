Such a grand entrance, so noble and regal and stunning!\nHowever, the decor on the inside leaves the classical and delves into the very whimsical, I felt as if I was in Alice in Wonderland! The rooms are wildly decorated, with stripes and patterns and mirrors on the window ledges which can be confusing!\nI was VERY disappointed that the linen wasn't to par and that there was only a motel like blanket, not a duvet.\nThe bar has a very rich ambiance, it's easy to sink into a leather chair, sip a cocktail or glass of wine.\nThe staff is accommodating, yet not totally exceptional with regards to warmth, the concierge needs to adopt a more embracing attitude; we like to be pampered and not feel like we are intruding....The spa was lovely, albeit dark. I had a wonderful facial.\nWould we go back? I'm not sure with all the choices in Paris....\nRoom Tip: 501 was well situated See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:10:06.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
