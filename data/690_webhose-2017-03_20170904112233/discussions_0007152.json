We stayed in Room #606, on the top floor, which has a panoramic view of both the Arc du Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower out of the same window (I've included a photo taken from our room).\nThe room itself was tastefully decorated, and very spacious (by Paris standards). The bathroom is clean and well-appointed. I believe our room included breakfast at the hotel, but we chose to eat out at Paris cafes each morning, so I can't comment on the quality of the food in the hotel.\nI love this little hotel - I'd be happy to be a guest here again and again!\nPROs:\n-- Amazing views\n-- Fairly good value (445 Euros/night for a room this big and with those views feels like decent value to me).\n-- There is a Metro stop entrance directly in front of the main entrance of the hotel.\nCONs:\n-- Not really a 'Con', but it's worth mentioning that they don't let you take your room key with you when you leave the hotel. Whenever you leave, you must surrender your key to the front desk, and they give it back to you when you return. Kind of a quirky thing that some guests may not be used to.\nRoom Tip: Ask for Room #606, if you're willing to reserve their most expensive room.
