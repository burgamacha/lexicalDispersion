The staff in this hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. The lounge was great for early morning breakfast (we took advantage every morning of our stay). The rooms are small but very well kept and very clean. The water pressure in the shower was absolutely amazing. The spa was fantastic! If you have time on your trip, we definitely recommend spending an hour in the private spa (steam & sauna). The location is excellent, there are many shops, bakeries and bar/lounges/restaurants in the area within a short walking distance. We would absolutely stay here again in the future. There is a beautiful fountain just a short walk down the street which we discovered on our first day there.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:55:38.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
