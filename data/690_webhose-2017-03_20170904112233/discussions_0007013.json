They helped me set up a proposal spot in the garden. Even in late winter start spring the garden was in beautiful shape and made for the perfect setting. We stayed in the Superior Double room with Garden view and the room was really special. There is a complimentary mini bar with a Nespresso machine that is restocked daily. The bathroom is a bit small as mentioned by other guests, however my fiancé and I found it big enough and the luxury in the room made up for everything else. We are so grateful for our stay. We will definitely come back for future stays ❤️", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:21:08.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
