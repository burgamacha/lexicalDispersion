We received a call asking if there was anything we particularly wanted in the room ( still or sparking water, extra coat hangers, what type of bedding...). On arrival we were greeted with smiles and assistance with our bags. The hotel is steeped in history depicted through the decor - even the wall paper paints a story. The bedroom was well appointed and the staff made this stay incredibly special. Harry was particularly fantastic taking time out of his busy schedule to explain the history. The restaurant served delicious food - Michelin starred. The prices for food were reasonable and we throughout recommend both dinner and breakfast. This hotel is not to be missed during a stay in London - whether that be a drink in the bar or afternoon tea looking over the beautifully kept gardens. If we could afford to stay here every time we were in London, we would! As a treat for a loved one - this hotel is a winner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:59:39.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
