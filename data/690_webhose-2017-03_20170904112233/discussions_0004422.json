With the bed you get pillow choices, and my mattress was too firm for my liking so they put on a nice topper which made it perfect. The hotel is conveniently located to everything, staff are helpful and friendly, and the breakfast is good with plenty of choice. I had just one problem, the room was overheated - a strange problem to have in early March - so I had to keep the window open during the day and take the blanket off during the night. Definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:27:56.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
