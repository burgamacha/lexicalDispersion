The room was clean , the hotel it self was pretty cool. Very artsy . The staff was great. Ladies at the front desk to the bell boy and the late night staff. He helped us get pizza at 1 in the morning. 99 cents a slice , you cant beat that. Our flight arrived early and check in is at 3 , they were nice enough to keep our luggage while we walked around the city and also the day we left. I loved it , next time i go again I will be staying there.Everything was super close, was able to walk to everything ! thanks again!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:49:19.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
