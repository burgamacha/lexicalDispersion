Stunning view (and yes you will have few obstacles blocking the direct view) from balcony (which is worth an extra $). Rooms were very, very, very clean and love the modern bathroom amenities: rope (love that one for sure), slippers. There was even a sewing kit that helped me with a small emergency. Friendly staff at front desk (or I should say just front as there was a self check in). Overall absolutely satisfied.\nRoom Tip: Book a rom with a view...it's worth it especially with balcony in place See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:00:18.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
