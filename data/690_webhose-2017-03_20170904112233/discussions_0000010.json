The Egerton is beautiful - luxuriously decorated, but lovely and warm, not at all stuffy. Utterly charming! The staff cannot do enough for you and Giulia, Jacques and Juan, as well as everyone else, were so kind and accommodating. The hotel is a very good value considering all that you get - delicious breakfasts and shortbread to die for! The location is fantastic as well, two blocks from the Victoria and Albert museum and just a few blocks in the other direction is Harrod's. The hotel is 1/2 a block from the main road, but on a quiet street. Truly perfect and a wonderful stay. Highly recommend!\nRoom Tip: The rooms are beautifully decorated and really have everything you need, but a bit small.
