We were upgraded to the garden suite which was so magical - a fabulous room with super-large bed and shutters allowing access into our own little terrace. What a special gift this was. We loved it.\nAs before, all staff were amazing especially Barbara and Valentina who provide such special service at breakfast - even when it gets a little busy they serve you so personally and with such genuine care. The check in staff are great too - lovely wine and tiramisu! And, I cannot thank the reception lady (sorry forgot her name) for helping us to catch a bus to the Appian Way - we had a great experience visiting after her advice. The young man who took our luggage up and served us drinks was so smiley and helpful - he also served us drinks later in the bar. The hotel staff are its true treasures.\nSo, so grateful for our fabulous break away here. We will be saving to come again!\nWell done to all for all they do - a real treasure of a place.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:30:30.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
