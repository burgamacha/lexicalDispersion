Lovely clean and crisp!!\nRoom was spotless and couldn't fault it at all!! We were originally told the wrong room number but was soon on our way to the correct room! Couldn't complain about anything,\nAt breakfast it was a buffet, but it was organised and calm, no mad rush, all food was nice and hot, not cold and soggy! So we would definitely be back as only a 2 minute walk to the Victoria Apollo theatre to see Wicked!! So was nice to be back in the room in a short space of time!\nLoved that most things in the room was controlled by a remote, even the curtains, was cool and the simple things make me and my mum laugh :) so thank you, to staff and the hotel!!\nWent into the bar for a drink, again couldn't fault the service, as this was waiter service so was no waiting what so ever!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:39:09.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
