After my posting I was contacted by the hotel who offered a complimentary night which I declined because we won't be in Paris for some time. Later, through social media we were informed that we were not the only ones who suffered theft from our room. Given this information and the fact that we will be spending a couple of weeks moving through Europe I emailed Sofitel.com and asked if they might extend the complimentary night to any hotel in Europe. This would effectively amount to less than a 10% discount. I understand business and corporate policy so I would understand and have taken no offence if they would not accommodate the request. However Sofitel didn't show the professional courtesy to even acknowledge the receipt of the request. Nor did they respond to a follow-up email. Even with the loss of substantial cash from our room and the annoying corporate policy which is to ignore customer inquiries I would have no problem recommending the Sofitel. We used the Sofitel chain a couple of times and found the front line staff and managers excellent and will stay at a Sofitel if in a convenient location. We will do so knowing the experience with staff and hotel will probably be excellent but also assume that any need for corporate support will likely be ignored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:25:38.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
