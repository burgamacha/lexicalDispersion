The hotel lived up to expectations. It is very clean and modern and the hotel staff were very friendly and polite. We had an issue with the hotel restaurant on our first night so they did not charge us for the meal and said they would try to improve the vegan options on the menu. The breakfasts at the hotel were also very good and the waiting staff very helpful and pleasant. I would recommend this hotel if staying in Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:56:32.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
