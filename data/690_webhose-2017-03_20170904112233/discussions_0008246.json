Great location, just minutes from the tube with loads of places to eat and drink nearby. Also close to Covent Garden for some good shopping, and the theatres (not that we went). We loved our garden room with outside space, and it was spacious and well equipped. The beds were comfortable, and the 2 doors to shut out noise were great. Shower was super powerful too! Staff were friendly and attentive. Cocktails in The Blind Spot were great (as is the door handle to get in!). Beds were comfy, breakfast was good (including 'breakfast in bed' on one morning!). Hotel is contemporary but always clean and never seemed busy. We really couldnt fault anything. So much so, that we intend to return next year - and maybe even ask for the same room!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:20:17.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
