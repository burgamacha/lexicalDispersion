Front desk personnel are very friendly and accommodating. Every time I come to Paris I make it a point to book this hotel. Rooms are clean and if you're lucky you can have a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. There is a free internet access & a computer you can use for any last minute bookings. The best part for me & my daughter is their wide array of breakfast selection in the morning. If it's not part of your accommodation, you can get a buffet breakfast for a reasonable price. This hotel has easy access to the Metro, Bir Hakeem, & RER Tour Eiffel. Very convenient location. Highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:07:55.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
