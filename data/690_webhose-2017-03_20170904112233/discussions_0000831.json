Modern business hotel with nice, spacious rooms, good service and very good breakfast. I stayed in a king room with separate living room. Hotel design is modern with a contemporary Asian feel in a modern high rise and an internal atrium. Very nice without being spectacular. I booked through Platinum AMEX provided me with a room upgrade (so room category described is at least one up from standard king). Breakfast is buffet style with great selection. I had a breakfast meeting and staff found my a nice private table (but they play music a little too loud for a top business hotel). Had a couple drinks at the bar in the evening and there was a very pleasant atmosphere and a friendly bartender who helped select a couple decent scotches. Room pricing was very reasonable for a hotel of this quality. Would come back for business but not on a family vacation (no wow factor, compared to say the Four Seasons in Istanbul or Paris)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:11:29.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
