Staff were really friendly and accommodating to our needs. Carlos A was especially friendly and would always take time to ask us how our day had been.\nExcellent location! Subway was less than 2 mins down the road to all the main attractions. Great restaurants and bars in walking distance too. The hotel staff recommended some great places to eat and drink.\nBeing my first trip I was a little bit worried about 4 girls in one room but the rooms in this hotel were bigger than most in NY and had more then enough space for all 4 of us! Cleaned everyday. No complaints at all. Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to New York!\nThank you Cambria for the great experience :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:04:23.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
