The best thing about the Standard was the staff; checked in by wonderfully efficient manager on duty. Had dinner at their restaurant (reviewed separately) and again, our server was very sweet and attentive - really charming. Ordered room service breakfast and the gentleman who delivered it was magnificent - steamed the milk for our coffee, brought up our drinks before our actual breakfast because he was afraid it was taking too long ( it wasn't), and then brought a second round of drinks with our food. The most gentle and caring man - he gets 6 stars! I did not catch his name, but he is tall with amazing dreadlocks and stunning leather jewelry. He not only deserves a promotion, but he should be training staff in superior customer service - seriously!\nHere's what kept this from being a 5 star experience: no coffee or tea maker in the room, silver shower curtain a bit tacky but mostly just not functional, sheets were not tucked into the bed, and bed frame that caught my shins more than once.\nThe huge Windows and lovely soft but heavy curtains were great! Watched the sun set and the snow start to fall. The Standard is definitely funky, young, and eclectic- just the way I like it!\nJust finesse those few things and you can call yourselves impeccable!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:55:01.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
