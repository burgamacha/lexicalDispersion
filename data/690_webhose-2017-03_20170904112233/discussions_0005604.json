Elevator wait times in lobby or from room floor level minimal. Rather odd though transiting from street level to front desk on upper level with luggage. Room was clean, quiet, and comfortable.

Every staff member encountered was very friendly and helpful.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:15:22.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
