I've never stayed at this hotel before so I can only give my review of our experience staying in the Junior Suite. The suite was on the corner and had a great view of Eiffel Tower, Tuileries and the Roue de Paris (Ferris Wheel) From the 5th floor you hear little to no outside noise when the balcony door/windows are closed. When open the noise isn't too bad from the Rue des Pyramides side but fairly noisy on the Rue de Rivoli side. The suite had all the expected amenities and was larger than expected. We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel did a little extra with rose petals on the bed and bath - very much appreciated. Included buffet breakfast had a good selection and was very delicious and filling. I was hoping the food selection would change each day but it was the same but good nonetheless. The hotel is centrally located close to the Louvre, Tuileries, Champs-Élysées, shopping on Rue Saint Honore, metro stations, etc. The rate for the suite is obviously more than a standard room but worth it for special occasions. I would definitely consider staying here again if I'm in Paris. Two things of note though not a big deal: 1) The front entry is a turnstile door. It's manual and may be hard for some to push through. There is a doorman usually there who assists in moving the door but maybe look into updating it. 2) It states that the TV in the room supports airplay (iOS devices) I didn't need it but I was curious if I could get it to work and it actually appears as though the TV only supports mirroring from an Android device.\nRoom Tip: Eiffel Tower view is nice but costs more See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:28:43.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
