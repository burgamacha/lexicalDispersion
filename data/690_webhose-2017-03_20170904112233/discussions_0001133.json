The hotel is film themed and each room is decorated wonderfully, its such a fun place to stay! There were some many little touches, all of which were completely free to all guests, we were really impressed and couldn't find any faults at all. The hotel has a movie theatre, which shows all the latest films, free of charge. There is also free afternoon tea to all guests as well as free minibar in all the rooms. Its not something you see everyday, as most hotels seemed to charge for everything. The hotel is so well positioned, its so easy to get around. I will definately be returning!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:36:58.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
