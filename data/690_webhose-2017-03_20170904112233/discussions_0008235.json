But...\nOn arrival we were told it was a £50 a day deposit so we had to pay £350 there and then and we would get it back straight after we checked out, pending the room was all in order.\nWe were unaware of this, British Airways whom we booked with didn't stipulate this either so we were a little bewildered but made the payment anyway. Only one of us had the money available as we cleared are banks and took it for spending money, had we have known we could have arranged something.\nUpon checking out my friend checked her account as she was assured her money would go straight back in, however a week later and the money is still pending and she has no other money available to spend until pay day. We also have been unable to email the hotel.... there isn't a direct one on their website so we are in limbo hoping the money is going to go back in at the moment, if there is a manager reading this please get in contact.\nThis really let the hotel down in our opinion as everything else was pretty spot on!\nThe staff were all almost too friendly and polite, the doormen were always cheerful upon greeting us and helpful flagging us cabs and giving us directions and recommendations to places. Even the cleaners and porters were very friendly! No faults there.\nThere was one time we called down to reception though for 2x extra glasses as we were only given 2 for a room of 4 and the man who answered was very blunt and rude and replied with \"Be up in 20 minutes\" before abruptly putting the phone down.\nThe hotel is very expensive for food and drink, we were gasping for a drink when we arrived but decided to go out in search of a grocery store after seeing it was $10 for a small bottle of water.\nDespite this, the rooms were spacious, clean and we had an awesome view of the Empire State Building from our 11th floor window.\nWe took our glass of free wine up to the rooftop one evening and had the most amazing views of the Chrysler and Empire State Building. I do think they could have cleaned it up a little up there- I no the bar is out of season but they could clean it and put out seats/lights on for guests to enjoy.\nAll in all a great stay- would stay again, but just be warned of the deposits they take upon arrival.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:55:51.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
