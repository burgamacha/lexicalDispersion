Yes it is a little outside the centre of Rome.\nThe hotel was very clean, the staff very helpful and friendly. Very quiet, perfect after a long day sightseeing. A few little shops and places to get a coffee, but the town closes by 7.00pm so nowhere other than the hotel to get a night-cap. Be aware of the Hotel Taxes you will have to pay, if not included in your holiday - these are Euro6.00 per night per person.\nWe travelled from Ciampino Airport, and the only transport to the hotel was via taxi. No buses or trains run to or from Ciampino Airport direct to to the hotel - you can get a bus from the Airport into the centre of Rome and then travel on the subway and free bus (as detailed below with regards to getting in and out of Rome). We paid Euro50.00 with a firm from the airport - this was a fixed price. Be careful of other firms saying it is cheaper - they charge taxes on top of the fee (but don't explain that when you get in). We were able to book them for the\n1. You can easily get into Rome within 40 - 45 minutes. There is a free bus (437 or 447) that you can catch at the end of the street that takes you direct to the Subway station at Rebibbia. You then pay just Euro1.50 per person for a 100minute ticket to travel the length of Rome. Travel the Blue Line to Collosso, which drops you ribht by the Colleseum, or get off at Termini to get the Red Line that takes your right to the Vatican. Quick tip when you are coming back, you need to get the (437 or 447) from the terminus (and not at the stop where you are dropped off) - take a right out of Rebibbia station, up the steps and then right to to the terminus on the right.\n2. I would pre-book your tickets into attractions before leaving the UK, as quite pricey when in Rome. We visited the Colloseum - and paid at the venue, it was just Euro24.00 for 2 adults, children under 18 enter for free. The Vatican was very expensive to get in (almost Euro200.00 for 2 adults and 2 children - children over 10 classed as adults, children under 6 go in for free).\n3. When eating out in Rome be careful to look for restaurants that say No Service Charge - otherwise it will be a pricey meal.\nAll in all, a great Hotel with great connections into Rome. Well worth the stay.\nRoom Tip: All rooms are good, nice and quiet. Hotel is in a business area, so no views to be had.
