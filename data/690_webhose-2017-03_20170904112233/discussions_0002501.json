From the polite and helpful staff to the beautiful room, our stay was nothing short of perfect. Every employee I encountered asked how our stay was going and if they could do anything to make it better, they were genuinely interested in making our stay as memorable as possible. The room was wonderful and larger than I expected, offering a impressive view of the city. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to the subway, or close enough to walk to Central Park. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, you will not be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:05:52.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
