Certainly this Tower Hill hotel does pretty much everything right. Check in was handled quickly and friendly, and we were given a room on the first floor. The room was spotless, tasteful and large enough for our two nights in town. The bed didn't seem to be king sized, however.\nYou get a comfy bed, despite the size we slept well, air conditioning that actually works, tea/coffee with a kettle, wardrobe.shelf space for your clothes and a lovely bathroom. Ours had an oversized shower cubicle with wonderful water pressure and a shower head that can be taken in your hand and moved, unlike many fixed shower heads in budget hotels. The TV was an older 4:3 model but worked fine with all the Freeview channels. Everything in the room was spotless and worked as it should.\nWe did make use of an iron and ironing board, which were delivered within a couple of minutes of the request, and we had extra tea/coffee which we went to collect from reception. We also requested a change of bed sheets on our second day which was also done without delay.\nAll in all a very good hotel, representing good value for money.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:02:54.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
