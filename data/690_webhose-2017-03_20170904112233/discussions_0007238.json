It was a nice walk along the river side to the venue and easy to get to. The hotel was just off the main strip. I would recommend if you are a visitor from abroad, you should select a high floor room for a view of the city. The breakfast was great , only downfall was no Weetabix for my Daughter but not a problem as we had them with us. Overall nice hotel in great location for Westminster activities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:27.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
