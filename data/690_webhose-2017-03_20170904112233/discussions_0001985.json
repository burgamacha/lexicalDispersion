The staff is incredible, and politely and courteously cater to your every whim! My wife wanted the room a bit warmer, but the rooms are warmed through radiators. They brought up a space heater and all was well. The wine at night was nice-- the staff actually came out to our table by the fire and asked us if we wanted a refill! Location is great, mere steps from Times Square, with easy access to the subway system. What was also great was early check in-- we traveled here, arriving early, and had arranged for early check in-- it was very nice to freshen up before we ventured out into the city!\nRoom Tip: upper floor away from the street See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:51:00.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
