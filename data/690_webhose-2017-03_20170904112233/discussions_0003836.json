It is located in Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood which is great for all the restaurants and bars located on 9th and 10th avenue. Walking distance to Time Square. The hotel is great and my room was not only quiet (I asked for a room not facing 48th street) but very clean and super comfortable. Now I was traveling on my own so even thought there isn't much space to put away your clothes for me it wasn't a problem. Geraldine was so nice and checked me in early upon my arrival which I greatly appreciated. Free breakfast yes it is a small dining area that gets pretty busy but nothing keeps you from bringing your breakfast up to your room. All the staff were not only friendly and courteous but always smiling and willing to help. I will recommend it to my friends and family and will go back next year when I go back to New York.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:29:15.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
