Steps from Rockefeller Center, an easy walk to Times Square and the Big Four offices, and a fine walk to Penn Station -- this place is incredibly well-located.\nAdd to that the amazing customer service, especially Nikki, and the access to the 7th floor dining of the neighboring Terrace Club, along with the free filtered chilled water in the hallway, and the views of 30 Rock and/or Radio City Music Hall, and you've got my new favorite NYC hotel. Oh! Did I say they have in-room Keurigs? And full-size ironing boards, irons, and the best toiletries I've had in quite some time?\nThis truly is a hidden gem and I'm thrilled I found it.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a view of 30 Rock and/or Radio City Music Hall.
