The rooms of this hotel are very comfortable, there is basically everything you need to have good moments in Paris. Also, it's in a great location, near to 3 metro stations. But what we loved most in this hotel was the great support of the staff. In some moments we needed some local information about the city that requested some french speaker and altough it was not their obligation, the staff was really very gently and made our stay easier and pleasant in Paris. Congrats to Paula and Margeaux for the gently and precious support provided to me and my wife during our stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:00:36.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
