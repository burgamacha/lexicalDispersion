First the location is excellent, only a block from the subway and an easy walk or short taxi ride to many parts of the city. The facility is a boutique hotel and has been nicely appointed. We were in a room with one bed at first and then a room with two. In each case the rooms were clean and comfortable, plus well designed and functional. The room with one bed was the typically small NYC room, but the one with 2 beds was pretty good size. The lobby has some very nice sitting areas, and the side with the fireplace was particularly nice on some bitter cold mornings. Had breakfast one morning in the attached restaurant, and while it was a bit pricy, the food and atmosphere were both very good. Overall the rates for rooms were very reasonable for New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:39:48.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
