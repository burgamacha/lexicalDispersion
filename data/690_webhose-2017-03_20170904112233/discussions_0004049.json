The hotel was well maintained and staff were very helpful, especially the Concierge team. We were asked on arrival if we would like to upgrade our room at a cost of $20 per night but declined the offer as we had not seen our allocated room, however if I returned to this hotel, I would definitely upgrade as the room was VERY small ( I know rooms are generally small but this was tiny). Housekeeping was first class (don't know how they managed to manoeuvre a vacuum round the bed, it must be a military operation for them).\nRoom Tip: Ask to see the size of rooms available for your budget See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:45:14.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
