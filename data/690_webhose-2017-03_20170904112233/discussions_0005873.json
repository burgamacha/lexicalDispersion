Service from Concierge to Chambermaid was faultless. Only niggle would have to be bar prices, am aware that Paris is expensive but â‚¬28 for a beer and G&T is absurd. Restaurant is closed on Sundays, but that again is not unusual in Paris. We did all the major sights on foot furthest was Eiffel Tower and that took us 45 mins to walk, but wondering around Paris is a treat in its self. Would definitely use hotel again when revisiting Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:12:57.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
