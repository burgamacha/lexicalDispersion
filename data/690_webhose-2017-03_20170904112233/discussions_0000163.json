We like to stay in a suite when we travel because we are traveling with our daughter. We had a 1 bedroom King Deluxe Suite and it was everything I had hoped for. It was really an apartment with full kitchen with a washer/dryer and 1.5 bathrooms! This suite had a private entrance which was really great, it was very well appointed and super 'user friendly.' I loved the big and luxurious bathroom as well as the huge, bright windows. Starting with the emails I sent prior to our stay, until we checked out.. the staff at the Taj was A+. I would definitely stay there again. The only thing I would recommend adjusting is the room service. We order breakfast most days and it was timely and the service was very good.. my complaint is with the food. It was very ordinary. Nothing special, lots of quantity over quality with did not match the rest of my stay at the Taj.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:22:07.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
