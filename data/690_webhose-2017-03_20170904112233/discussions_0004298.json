The room is amazing, the seating area being located at one end of the building offers a view to three directions, windows from floor to ceiling absolutely bright. Even though it was raining most of the time, there was no feeling of being cloistered at any time. Breakfast is top, service at the reception excellent and particularly friendly. There were no waiting times on check in or out, the first available agent takes care of you guiding you to a desk for the purpose. There is no bar, so there is no barrier between the guest and the agent, nice and relaxed. Upon early arrival, every effort was made to make the room available immediately at no additional charge.\nI definitely prefer this stylish and modern hotel, to the old-fashioned houses closer to the city. There is a direct speedy underground to the city centre, so not really a problem. With Bercy village next door, you can also easily go out for lunch or dinner.\nI enjoyed the stay and will certainly return.\nThanks to the whole team for making Paris such an experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:13:59.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
