It new property, with nicely designed rooms and common areas. Staff is very friendly - but clearly lacks some training, namely on the IT system and information in general.\nI had requested a room with a king size bed and repeated this request during the check-in, which already had taken very long. Surprisingly the agent responded she'd not know how to look this up and she hoped that my request had automatically been respected ... it was not. So I wen't down again, asked for a room change ... which took another 10 minutes ... and again resulted in twin room allocated ... so I went down again and asked for a different agent, who finally got me the room type I had asked for. Similar experience for breakfast: I asked in the evening at what time the Level breakfast starts and was told at 6:30am. Now in the morning, it turned out to be 7am and was told to go to the restaurant instead. Indeed, the restaurant displayed 6:30am, but was not open at 6:40am, as yet ... finally it opened at 6:45am ...Both issues could easily be resolved by proper training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:52:37.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
