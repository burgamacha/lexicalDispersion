Every single employee we met was polite, helpful, and accommodating. They were exceptional, making a dream vacation great. When we had a snafu with the in-room safe, one of the front desk agents came up to help us get our things out with no extra charge.\nUnfortunately, they were in the midst of some remodeling during our stay, but that was only a minor inconvenience. I'm sure the hallways will look even better when they finish up. The rooms aren't nearly as big as in America, but that's par for the course in Europe.\nThe next time I visit London, the Montana Hotel will be my first choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:04:37.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
