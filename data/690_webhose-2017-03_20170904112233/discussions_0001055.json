A reasonably priced hotel close to the airport and providing a free shuttle bus at regular intervals running to a set timetable.\nSpacious rooms, with comfortable beds and good showers to wash away the crud after those long flights. The hotel does not have a bar or restaurant, but will happily recommend places to eat or grab a pizza delivery. The hotel offers free parking and wifi which keeps the costs down.\nOn the return journey our flight out of SFO was not until 7.30pm. After a complimentary breakfast, we checked out, and the hotel was happy to store our luggage for the day so that we could use the shuttle to the airport and catch the BART into the city for the day. On our return, the shuttle driver was happy for us to collect our luggage and then take the return shuttle back to the airport for our flight. Very convenient and allowed us to make use of the full day in San Francisco for shopping and sightseeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:22:43.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
