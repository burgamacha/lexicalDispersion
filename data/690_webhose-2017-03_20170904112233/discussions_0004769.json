The price per night is unbelievably good for the location of the hotel, which is located at 42nd Street and 8th Avenue. Recently renovated, this used to be the Milford Plaza Hotel. You are surrounded by Broadway theaters and Times Square is a block away. To the east, 9th Avenue is the beginning of Hell's Kitchen and endless restaurants. Two blocks south is the Port Authority Terminal where you can easily catch a subway line to almost anywhere in the city.\nThe rooms are clean and simple with basic amenities. We had a larger city view room but it was still about the size of a larger cabin on a cruise ship. Comfortable for two people but a family of four would be falling all over each other.\nLuggage storage after check-out was a breeze and at no cost (other than tips).\nWe would happily go back. You could stay at the Marriott for 3X the price, but no better location.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on a higher floor to get away from city noise.
