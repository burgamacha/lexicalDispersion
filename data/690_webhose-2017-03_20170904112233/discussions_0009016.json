From the moment we arrived at The Jewel we felt at home. Rene greeted us in the morning and was wonderful. Because we had an early flight (we got to the hotel by 8:30am) he explained that for a small fee we would be able to check in early and get our room. Our room was small, but cozy. Everything was VERY clean. We were also assisted when we left by Iris. She kept our bags for us when we checked out so we could do a quick trip around town one more time before we left. Overall we had an awesome time and I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in town. Very convenient location.\nRoom Tip: We could hear the elevator run, but other than that I was happy with my room.
