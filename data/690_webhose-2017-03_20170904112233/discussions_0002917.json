Fantastic location at the heart of New York. Check in as usual was very quick and efficient. The room was exactly the same as the others we have visited. The only criticism I would have with the room is there are no tea/coffee making facilities. The selection of free films and tv available was very good. Like the others we have visited, everything in the room is managed via an iPad! The bar is really nice but quite expensive for drinks. Two black coffees in take away cups was $12 versus $6 in the small take away cafe a few doors away. All of the staff we spoke to for directions etc were excellent. Good value for such a central location in NYC. I would happily use a citizenM hotel in the future.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:10:58.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
