From the minute we were helped out of our cab we were impressed with the excellent service and attention to detail. every last member of staff made us feel like we were a special guest, knew our names and our preferences for our stay, but it never felt gushing or intrusive. The room was very comfortable and beautifully appointed and the rainfall shower in the bath - one of the best I've experienced! The bar was fabulous, the interior felt like an impeccably maintained gentleman's members club from the 19th century and the conservatory was a more modern lounge, both delightful places to enjoy some drinks with friends and the service again was courteous, fun and warm. Mrs T's rice pudding is to die for! Undoubtedly the most indulgent ten minutes I've ever spent with a dessert. And the must-have drink is a homemade Old-fashioned, with whisky or rum, complete with it's own lititle smokey presentation show. The full breakfast was hearty and tasty and we'd return to our room each night with a lovely turndown service and the tv tuned into love songs. We honestly had a lot of fun at the Milestone and felt pampered and refreshed from start to finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:10:58.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
