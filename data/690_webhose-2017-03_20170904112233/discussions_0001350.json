The subway station is about a block away and the 9/11 memorial is right in front of the hotel. Although not conveniently located to Times Square, it is a good location and I felt safe despite all the construction in the area. The staff was absolutely nice and helpful. The reason for 4 stars is because the pool looked nice in the pictures but was absolutely terrible. Kids everywhere splashing around and the water was dirty to my standards. Would have been nice if staff was there to control the chaos around the pool area\nRoom Tip: the higher the floor, the better See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:51:32.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
