We had a private dining room as there was over 6 of us and the table was decorated perfectly with Alice in Wonderland themed decorations. There was a choice of 21 tea's to choose from and the food was served in 2 sections, the sandwiches first then the scones and cakes, all of which looked so in theme and tasted delicious. The service was excellent, the staff were very friendly and helpful with our dietary requirements. I will definitely be coming back for afternoon tea again at Taj 51 and will be telling all my friends about it too!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:50:51.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
