The location is amazing - in the middle of a hutong, and a short walk to a metro station. It has a fascinating history as a courtyard house and has maintained the unique architectural character. The family room was extremely comfortable, well appointed and furnished with lovely antique furniture. The staff - especially Indigo - were friendly and extremely helpful.
