I got a great deal on booking.com.\nThe rooms are small but perfect since you're not really spending tons of time in the room. The bathroom in the room was large and great.\nThere is no restaurant on the premises which makes it a bit inconvenient if you had plans to eat at the hotel.\nThe pool is small but the kids loved it! I do wish that there was a hot tub instead of the sauna in the hotel.\nStaff was great and friendly!\nI would definitely stay there again if I were in the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:51.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
