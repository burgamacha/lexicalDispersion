It was very clean and comfortable and had tea/coffee making facilities, a safe and an over bath shower. We flew to CDG airport, got the RER B train to Gare du Nord,then the Metro line 4 to Gare de L'Est and line 7 from there to Cadet, which is approx 200 metres from the hotel. All staff were very friendly and helpful. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but there are plenty restaurants and eateries nearby for breakfast. It has a cool little lift and the whole hotel has a pleasant quirky feel. We would definitely return here if returning to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:13:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
