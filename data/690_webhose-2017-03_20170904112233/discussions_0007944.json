The bed wasn't as comfortable as I would have hoped, but it suited our needs.\nThe hotel is in a safe area where we felt comfortable walking at night, and is close to the Bayswater rode station, which was really convenient. There are also lots of shops and restaurants nearby, so you don't need to venture far from the hotel after a long day of sightseeing to have dinner.\nAll in all we were pleased with our stay, but I may purchase an upgraded room if we visit again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:10:40.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
