Everything from check in to check out was seemless. The staff are excellent - each and every member of staff we encountered was friendly, knowledgable and happy to help. We stayed in a Hudson View room on the 53rd floor and the views were fabulous. The room was very spacious even by NYC standards as was the amazing bathroom complete with bath, large shower and TV. The level of in room house keeping is very high. I don't know how they manage it but the rooms are cleaned and made up immaculately and yet you never see housekeeping or housekeeping trolleys. I amazed how they do it. The turn down service provided nightly is also excellent as each night you are provided with a letter offering details of the weather forecast for the next day and possible activities for you to consider as well as a Quote: , or pearl of wisdom about sleep. It's a very nice touch.\nWe used in room dining a couple of times (breakfast and dinner) and the attention to detail is brilliant. They bring a table complete with linens and flowers and set the table as if you were dining in the restaurant. The food was excellent.\nThe only thing that I felt was trying to be too clever and ultimately not working as well as it could was how they operate mini bar services. The mini bar and in room snacks are motion sensitive. Once you pick up and item from its spot you have 30 seconds to put it down or you are charged for it. We had seen this in the in room information which detailed this therefore did not pick anything up however at some point possibly during housekeeping items had been somehow dislodged and these items were now appearing on our bill. This issue was addressed and was a non issue however it seem like a cumbersome feature that is not fool proof.\nIn terms of location I loved this hotel. It is facing Central Park and more or less above the 59th Street Subway so is excellently appointed with all areas of NYC easily accessible from this location.\nI will definitely be back to this hotel and have plans to try Mandarin Oriental properties in other locations when I travel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:02:18.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
