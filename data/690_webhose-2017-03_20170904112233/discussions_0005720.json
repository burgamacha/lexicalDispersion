When you arrive at the hotel, you are welcomed at the reception by sitting on a chair, at a desk. They want you to be comfortable, like home.\nOur room was suberb: nice decoration, very comfortable bed, large shower, work desk with office chair, original lighting - we could hardly ask for more.\nBreakfast is excellent with freshly squeezed orange juice, and a variety of good things in a small but well maintained buffet. Coffee from their machine is excellent. In the afternoon, they serve free cakes, cookies and coffee in the same room, an industrial styled living room where, I must say, it was quite nice to sit there and relax. One afternoon, they were doing some cleaning, and had opened the windows in that room to freshen the air. The place was cold, we did not stay long and returned to our room. 10 minutes later, reception called us to inform us that the windows had been shut, and we could come back if we wished. How many hotels receptions colleagues would take the time to do that, without even asking your room number?\nOften you don't even need to ask - they come to you and ask you whether you need anything.\nAsk them for suggestions for restaurants - they will give you great tips. There are great choices around the hotel.\nThe Hotel Fabric is definitely a place I will return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:38:50.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
