Shops around the corner such as GAP, Levis etc. Lots of cosy bars and restaurants. Our twin bedroom was just as we expected, good beds and enough space to \"move around\". Bathroom lovely with a tub! Nespresso machine just by bed. The Roissy bus (from GDG) stops about two blocks away. Very polite, friendly and service minded staff. Breakfast was very good with different types of eggs, bread, croissants, pancakes, fruit, yogurt and so on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:36:16.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
