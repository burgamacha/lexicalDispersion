The room was clean, comfortable, and quite spacious for NYC, and the staff at every level could not have been kinder, easier to work with, and more accommodating. This made all the difference for us with a toddler and an infant. Susana, the manager, went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and our stay would be as flexible as possible given that we weren't sure exactly when our work would be done. Josie and Ashley at the front desk also helped us and were just so lovely. Marisol did a great job cleaning our room. Finally, the location was great -- obviously a little out of the way but a super easy walk to 9th Avenue and all its great restaurants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:47:52.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
