Friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were very bright, clean and modern. Bathroom was a good size and clean. There is a cafe a few doors down which offers a wide selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner options to go or to eat in at a reasonable price. The hotel lounge on the top floor offers excellent views and you can request to take your kids up during the day when it is closed so they can enjoy the views too. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:18:28.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
