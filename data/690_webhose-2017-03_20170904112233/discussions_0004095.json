I contracted some type of respiratory infection and the hotel was performing very noxious maintenance. The combination of the two made sleeping in my room impossible. I contacted the front desk, they found me a room on another floor not as affected by the fumes. The room was not completely free of fumes (they permeated the entire hotel) but I was able to get some sleep that evening with the windows open and the heater fan running constantly. I would love to stay here again, but I would be certain the renovations are completed. My original room facing the garden was much quieter than the temporary room I had facing the street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:06:28.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
