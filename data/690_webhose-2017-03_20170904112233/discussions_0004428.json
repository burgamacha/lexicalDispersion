In regards to other areas it is so easy to access from here due to the close proximity to metro stations. The staff were so helpful which imo makes a hotel 5*, treated excellent from arrival to departure. Shower was excellent, powerful and hot. Bed was also extremely comfy. Would definately stay again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:39:22.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
