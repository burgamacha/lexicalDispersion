We wanted a little bit of luxury while staying in London in a perfect central location before seeing a west end show (The Lion King - for the 4th time!).\nThe location is definitely central - just a short walk from Leicester square tube station. Staff were lovely and friendly. Room was nice and big - over looking the main square. We were a little apprehensive about the Christmas market staying open late making it noisy at bedtime but it closed at 10pm which meant it was very quiet at night.\nMaking the most of time without a baby we were given late check out. Unfortunately some loud building work woke us at 9am but that was still plenty of sleep for us sleep deprived parents. We mentioned it on check out and they were very apologetic. Overall we had a brilliant stay. Would consider staying here next time we were in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:56:39.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
