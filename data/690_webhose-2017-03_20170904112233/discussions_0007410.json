Hotel was excellent. Very new and nice inside, small but very nice functional rooms with great view of Eiffel Tower. All staff encountered were friendly, helpful and spoke great english. Absolutely loved the location, right next to the Eiffel Tower with amazing views, great transport links, feels very safe area even at night. Why spend more on a hotel when you can get a really solid 4 star here? Really nice places to eat and see all around.\nRoom Tip: Ask for eiffel tower view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:25:26.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
