From the check in to the check out every interaction with the staff was above and beyond. The front desk staff at check in were very friendly and helpful. We showed up early 10am and the room was not ready yet so the staff took our bags so we could explore the city. When we returned at 4pm the staff had our keys ready and had already moved our bags up to the room. Overall, there demeanor was more than pleasant which provided a great vibe to the place. We interacted with the staff through our stay several more times and every time it was the same story. The hotel is also very lovely - rooms are decent size, well equipped and very comfortable. Location was also great with easy access to the Subway. All in all this one of the best NYC boutique hotels in NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:06:40.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
