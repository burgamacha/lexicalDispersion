Location is fantastic - I've stayed in a few different areas in Paris previously and this one is just so central to everything. The hotel is a small boutique hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff who can't do enough for you. The room (although small) was very comfortable, nicely decorated and quiet. We had a minor issue with the hot water but a call down to the front desk and all was resolved with a big apology. Reasonably priced for such a great hotel/location and would 100% stay there again when we next go back to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:36:39.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
