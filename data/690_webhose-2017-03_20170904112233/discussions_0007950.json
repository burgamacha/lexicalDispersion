When we arrived at the hotel we were met with a very warm welcome and our room was ready early. We were in the fifith floor with good views of the London eye, nelsons column and Big Ben. The room was big with a good sized bathroom with lots of toiletries. The room had a mini bar and tea and coffee facilities. It was very clean with nice fluffy towels, and the pillows were amazing. We didn't eat in the hotel but did have a afternoon drink in the bar. We were only there for one night and left it late to get a taxi to get to the station on the Sunday. It was busy with a st Patrick's day parade so the taxis were busy. The concierge at the hotel went out looking for one for us. He found one that came into Leicester Square to the hotel door to,pick us up. We thought this was great. I would definatly stay here again the next time we are in London, our visit there was flawless. Nothing was to much trouble for any of the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:56:32.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
