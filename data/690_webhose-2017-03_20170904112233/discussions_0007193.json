We had reserved a Deluxe Queen room with harbor view. I upgraded this for a very convenient price.\nTerrace bar is great. make a reservation to secure your entrance. No minimum consumption required.\nGreat location. Excellent restaurants and coffee shops nearby.\nRoom service was bad: they didn't know what was available from the menu. After ordering, they called me back saying they run out of the products.\nBetter to enjoy nearby top restaurants.\nRoom Tip: rooms facing Hudson river are simply incredible !!!!
