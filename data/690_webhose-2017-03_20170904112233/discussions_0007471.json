All basics covered. The bathroom is also clean, plenty of towels provided. No conditioner available, only body/hair wash. The English breakfast is decent. The continental does not include cold cuts or cheeses, otherwise good choice of pastry, yogurts, cereals,jam, honey, chocolate spread, fresh fruit, dried fruit and compote, smoothie, milk, juices... and more. For a budget hotel is all right. The hotel is situated right next to the tube station, and also has its own parking for the customers. Free spaces always available. The staff is polite and accommodating. However this time our stay was blemished by a taxi company they use. We ordered the taxi at 6.30pm. At 7.20pm we were still waiting for it and almost missed our meeting. When it eventually arrived, the driver could not provide taxi licence. We were charged £8 for a 1.7m journey (for our return trip the taxi we booked only charged us £6 and it was much later in the evening, around 11pm!) We left a pair of glasses in the car, those never got returned. We complained about the issue to the duty manager, he was polite and listened, but failed to reassure us that the issue will be looked into.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:45:29.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
