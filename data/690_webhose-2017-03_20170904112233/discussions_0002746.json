This was our third stay here over the years. Overall it was similar to past visits- the room (king) had two bathrooms which was nice and was relatively spacious by NY standards. The furnishings haven't changed much over the year- somewhat sparse but the bed it comfortable and there was a chair with ottoman. Overall- the room was fine although we could hear both the large fans running (in the back) most of the night and the neighbors one night- could use some soundproofing. That said, given the location and the price- it was reasonable. Breakfast (continental) was included. Never saw in room dining so likely it isn't available- which is something to consider when staying here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:26:10.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
