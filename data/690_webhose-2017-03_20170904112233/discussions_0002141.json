The W Union Square did not disappoint! Rooms have very high ceilings that make them feel spacious and some of the larger bathrooms I have had in the city. I requested a coffee maker in the room, which they gladly accommodated. The location is ideal if you want to be in lower Manhattan ... quick walk to Herald Square and the Flat Iron district. Great restaurants in the area and doormen are happy to advise. Beds are very comfortable and my room on 16th floor was void of street noise. I will be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:52:31.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
