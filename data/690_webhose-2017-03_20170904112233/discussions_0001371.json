We also stayed there for the duration of the wedding.\nI cannot recommend The Roger highly enough. To a person, the staff is warm, welcoming, helpful, and friendly. There is complimentary wine in the evening during the week in the hotel's comfortable and cute lounge, which was a great place to gather and chat with guests.\nThe rooms themselves are well appointed and extremely comfortable; my only regret is that we didn't get a chance to enjoy our room's terrace because of the March blizzard!\nIt's also very well located, close to public transportation, Madison Square Park, Herald Square, and a lot of other sights, but it's not noisy or crowded. It's really a perfect place to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:34:15.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
