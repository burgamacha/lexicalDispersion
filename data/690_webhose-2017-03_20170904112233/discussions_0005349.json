We chose the Millesime Hotel, it is located in a beautiful part of Paris city right beside the metro station and plenty of cafes to eat and drink in. The rooms are small but nicely decorated, beds are comfortable and the room has everything you need. We where extremely surprised with the location of the the hotel as it is also extremely close in walking distance to all the major sites. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling for a weekend break to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:33:58.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
