The hotel was built in 1917 and was formerly know as the Raffles Beijing. I was taken on a tour by the German manager and it was pointed out that Mao formed the PROC in the ballroom in 1949. He said that they were researching all the historic connections and it would be more of a feature at a later date. I would also like to mention Ms. Liu, the lobby manager on duty, who not only checked me in quickly, but personally escorted me to my room and gave me a proper room orientation.\nRoom Tip: The old hotel faces the street, the new wing is in the back.
