The service at The Pierre is unrivaled anywhere in the world. I'm from Brazil and you we have truly unbelievable resorts and hotels, but this gem of a hotel would be a success anywhere it would land. The staff is truly genuine and the look of happiness on their faces is priceless. They are truly proud to be in hospitality and you feel it. I only wish I could stay forever and live this experience all day.
