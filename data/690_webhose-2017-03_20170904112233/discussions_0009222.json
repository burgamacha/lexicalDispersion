Very clean and modern, designed for an efficient stay for people who have things to do. If you want to sit in a palatial foyer, reading the Sunday Times, with loads of staff in uniform milling about, this is not for you. If you want somewhere to get a good nights sleep and be on your way, this is it.\nThe rooms are VERY small, intentionally. No Ikea style wardrobe or chest of drawers. A few hooks and an extendable desk area. These are not criticisms, it's designed to be ultra efficient, Japanese style. No kettle, don't need one, free tea and coffee downstairs in the dining area that doubles as a bar/lounge/lobby. And fresh milk for your tea, none of that UHT crap that you get in normal hotels. No phone in the room, don't need one.\nTouch control panel for heating/cooling/lighting. Also on the touch panel are controls for \"do not disturb\" and \"don't make up my room\" which illuminate outside the door.\nSmall bathroom, again being efficient with space, but and absolutely fantastic shower, jet spray and amazon rain.\nBrick Lane is a fantastic location too. If you're going for a curry, be sure to \"barter\" before you go in, you'll get a deal...\nRoom Tip: The rooms are very small, designed that way to be very efficient. I believe you can opt to pay more... See more room tips Green Features: No wasteful tea making facilities in the room. Super free facilities in the lobby/lounge area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:48:50.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
