The hotel is extremely well-run (we have stayed here a few times previously) and can recommend it without reservation.\nThe staff are simply first rate - nothing is too much trouble, they are charming, efficient and professional - and have perfect English (our French being primitive if enthusiastic!)\nRooms and facilities are very good. Beds are comfortable, breakfast great fun and views simply stunning. The Mus√©e D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Tuillery Gardens and Louvre are just THERE!\nYou will not be disappointed. We are already looking forward to our next visit.\nRoom Tip: Seek view overlooking there Tuilerie Gardens See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:29:57.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
