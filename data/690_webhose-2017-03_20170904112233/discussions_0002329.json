It was the perfect place to stay during a short trip to Paris. Before arrival, the staff helped arrange transportation from the train station, which worked perfectly. Upon arrival to the hotel, the staff was extremely welcoming and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. We had booked the Eiffel Terrace Suite and were upgraded to the Marignan suite, which had a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower from a huge terrace on the 6th floor. The staff member even offered to take a picture of us in front of the tower. What a great memory! The terrace was a perfect spot to enjoy some champagne and watch the tower light up at night. It was everything I dreamed Paris could be.\nThe restaurant was another great experience. The menu was very imaginative, and the servers went out of their way to explain everything about the dishes, even pointing out everything that was local, and quintessentially french.\nIf I ever find myself heading back to Paris, this is the only place I would stay. I can't recommend it enough.\nRoom Tip: Great views, close to Champs Elysees.
