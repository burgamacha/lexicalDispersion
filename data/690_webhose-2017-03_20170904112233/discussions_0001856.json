Bed was so comfortable and the room was clean, roomy for Paris standards and larger than most Paris hotels where I have stayed. Nespresso machine in the room was also a nice addition. I found the service to be attentive. Our room was not ready when we arrived early in the morning, but they quickly preoared it while we ate breakfast in the lounge and found us to alert us. I will be returning to Paris again in the fall and we will stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:13:01.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
