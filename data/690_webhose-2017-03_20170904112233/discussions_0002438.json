Service is kind and attentive and the most important, they speak English ( believe me , it was like an oasis in China)\nThe rooms are big and comfortable, clean and complete amenities make your stay memorable.\nThe only \"But\" was the air conditioning in my room. It was impossible to control and it was always at 27 Celsius a complete oven !!!!\nI asked for help and never went to solve it.\nAfter this only detail, they lost the perfect 10 so I give this hotel an 8/10. I will return for sure here in my next China trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:25:36.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
