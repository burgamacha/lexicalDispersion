Our room was huge with floor to ceiling windows so we had some great views. The staff and the concierge particularly were very helpful and friendly, everyone always had a smile and a kind word for you. We had a few cocktails in the rooftop bar, definitely worth a visit, we got some great photos of the Chrysler building all lit up at night there.\nI would absolutely stay here again no problem, we loved it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:16:07.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
