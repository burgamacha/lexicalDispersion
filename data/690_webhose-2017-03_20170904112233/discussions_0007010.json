When we walked in we were greeted like special guests. This attitude remained the entire duration of our stay. I truly felt it was their pleasure to assist us. There was great attention to detail, down to the rose petals on our bed and around the tub (we were on our honeymoon). The lobby was exquisite and the room was immaculate. Please bear in mind that European rooms are a bit small and the bathroom is usually a separate rooom. That took a little getting used to. We had room service everyday (great breakfast!) and when we were tired of exploring, there were movies at the front desk we could borrow and watch videos from the comfort of our room.
