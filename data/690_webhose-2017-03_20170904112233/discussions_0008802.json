The location is great, it's easy to find, not far from the tube/train station and plenty of busses pass. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to surprise me with a birthday card and chocolates when they found it it was my birthday, such a thoughtful touch. Our room was clean, fairly spacious and the bed very comfortable, consistent with previous Premier Inn stays. We only had one breakfast and both opted for the continental, this was the only downfall as the pastries/cereal/fruit had all nearly run out (we did come down at 10.40, still another 20 mins left of service) so did feel slightly robbed. We will definitely be using this hotel again if we go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:40:16.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
