Although it is a basic hotel, it was just what we needed, the bed and a place to wash. It was better than what we were expecting in fact, the room was spacious enough for the kids to run around. The breakfast was good and has variety of choices, though we only had it once. It is a centrally located place, easy access to the Underground, walking distance to London Eye, Westminister Abbey etc. Lots of restaurant nearby so dining is not a problem. Will return again if we visit London in the future.\nRoom Tip: Request for room with view, ie London Eye See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:27:54.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
