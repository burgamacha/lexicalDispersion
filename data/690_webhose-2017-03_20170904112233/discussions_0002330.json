It exceeded my expectations! It was so nice I almost didn't want to leave the room. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The beds are so comfy its almost like you were sleeping on a cloud. They are right across the street from the metro and walking distance to the Eiffel Tower in one direction and arc du triumph in the other. They have parking and it's big enough to accommodate a large SUV at 45 euros a day. The breakfast was included in my booking but is ordinarily 30 euros pp. It was buffet style with eggs cooked to order. Ready to make this hotel one I visit yearly.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:27:55.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
