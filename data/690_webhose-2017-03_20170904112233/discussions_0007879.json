This is the second time we have stayed and last time was good but this just got better.\nThe title of my review is this place is the place to stay but if everyone does the price will go up.\nThe location doesn't seem very good when you look at maps of London but you can honestly be at the hotel within 20 minutes ( tubes permitting) from arriving at Euston. A few stops on the Northern Line to Bank. A short walk and 2 stops on the DLR followed by a 1 minute walk to Limehouse station.\nIt is also located a nice walk along the Thames Path to Tower Bridge ( some nice real ale pubs between the hotel and Wapping).\nThe hotel itself is very clean and the staff are friendly and very helpful. The included breakfast this time included bacon ( an absolute brilliant improvement from last time).\nThe hotel also allows you to bring in takeaways and more than that will give you menus for deliveries.\nThe bar is well stocked but to be honest this is the only downside because it is very expensive.\nwould we stay again.Well we wouldn't hesitate if the prices don't go up!\nOne point of note is the cement works next door but remember you are visiting the best city in the world so why would you want anything other than a good base to sleep, have breakfast and then set off to see the sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:42:05.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
