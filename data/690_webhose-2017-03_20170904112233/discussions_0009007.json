Kensington was a superb area in which to stay. The hotel was right across the street from the tube, which was super-convenient. Lots of attractions closeby - the V&A Museum, Science Museum, Natural History Museum, as well as Kensington Palace & gardens & Harrods, all within walking distance. Pay the small extra amount for the Lounge Access at the Hotel - entitles you to breakfast & Happy Hour; coffee & tea. Backs onto a garden - such a treat. Woke up to the birds chirping every morning. Excellent service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:23:14.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
