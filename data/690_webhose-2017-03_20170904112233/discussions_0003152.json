The location of the hotel is beautiful, and the person who saw us at the front-desk (David) was kind enough to give us an upgrade, which put us in a better / higher room with amazing views onto the river. Lovely! Everything was just perfect except for the fact that: 1. They've charged USD 20 more for the wine we requested (and I had to have them double-check prices at the checkout), 2. They charged us for breakfast, which was already included in the reservation (and I had to call them to get a refund - the person in accounting was not too happy and hung up without saying a word after he told me he was going to reimburse it). So, I would say: def book it, but keep an eye out for the charges they make to you during your stay and afterwards. I would have given it 5 stars, but they did not deserve it this time.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors tend to be noisier, because of the roof top restaurant and night club.
