I thought I had the wrong place and almost turned back but someone saw me looking lost and pointed me in the direction of the hotel door around the corner. There may be a sign I missed in the dark but if not it would be good to have one to direct weary travellers to the reception.\nI really liked this hotel, it felt very homely and the staff were friendly. I liked the glass lift in the centre of the building too, a nice feature.\nI stayed in room 303 which had lovely French doors opening out onto a balcony overlooking the grassy square at the side of the hotel. The room was large and clean, and the bathroom was nice.\nThe continental breakfast was good with fresh fruit, yogurt and cereal, although the croissants weren't the best.\nOverall I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:51:39.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
