It's was an amazing experience, one that is definitely for the books.\nLocation: Westin Paris Vendome is located in the Vendome area (high end boulevard with the hall of justice, Ritz, etc.). The path to Westin Vendome coming from the Opera is a very scenic walk. Westin is actually adjacent to the Jardin du Tuiliers and you can have rooms with a view of the gardens, the Louvre and the Eiffel. It's 5 mins walk to Concord and the train station.\nRooms: The rooms are quite small, as expected of a classic Parisian hotel. It reminds me a lot of many movies I have seen about Paris. Our room was perfectly situated at the top most floor, with a view of the Parisian city scape and rooftops. My wife and I fell in love with it. Old, a bit eerie, but that's part of the charm.\nAmenities: Standard amenities to be expected of a 5star hotel. The did not have coffee/tea or a perculator.\nService: The staff is super! Totally debunked the \"rude\" connotation of a Parisian. Myline, one of the girls at the reception, is the best!\nCost: Can be quite pricey.\nRoom Tip: choose the room with the view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:17:17.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
