Easy, quick ride from SFO - $20 cab ride only 5-10 minutes (no traffic).\nProperty is clean, parking is free and is close in proximity to Grand ave - plenty of dining and shopping. Frt desk folks were friendly and helpful as were the breakfast staff. Spacious lobby for impromptu meetings was great and bar has decent beer/wine selections but limited tap. 1-king room was spacious and comfortable. High-floor room was quiet. All room amenities worked great.\nTypical breakfast options at Hilton properties, but cooked-to-order stuff is great. Nice option of taking hotel shuttle back to SFO at crack of dawn. Would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:09:11.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
