My husband & I walked everywhere with the exception of the Vatican we took the tram to it.\nThe hotel itself is lovely inside very quick checkin. bedroom was a good size nice crisp sheets good size bathroom. We were on a very high floor & our only niggle was that sometimes the lift didn't work so we had all the stairs to climb. We were only in 1 evening for happy hour which was actually 4 or 5 hours of half price drinks. Cocktails were €12 so then were €6 not bad & they were very very nice indeed. The buffet on the bar consisted of salads, small cheeses, sandwiches, crisps, nuts, olives etc. It was all really nice. The rugby was on the weekend we were there & on the Saturday night there were quite a few of the revellers in the bar but nothing too loud or noisy. Across the road from the hotel there was a lot of graffiti on the buildings but sadly Europe on a whole has this everywhere. No RESTAURANTE in house but a great breakfast in the morning catering for all tastes. We would definitely return to this hotel as we found the staff pleasant, rooms clean, breakfast choice, well situated.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:32.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
