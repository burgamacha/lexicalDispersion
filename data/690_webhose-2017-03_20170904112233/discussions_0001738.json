I am a stickler for customer service and the staff went above and beyond every single day. Chris, Romeo, Jaswant, and Sue staffed our dining room and anticipated every need as well as providing more than expected. They were very friendly, provided impeccable service, and were very responsive to our requests. One day we sang happy birthday to a co-worker and the next thing I knew they brought her her a special dessert with a lit candle. Chris, Romeo, Jaswant , and Sue treated us like royalty and it was very difficult to go back to our real lives. General mgr. Simone and Event Coordinator Leticia were also incredible and more than attentive. They and their staff also went above and beyond while providing exemplary customer service and taking care of all our requests. Although I don't have names I also want to compliment the parking/valet staff who handled our overbooked event like champions. The hotel rooms were very nice and the beds were very comfortable. I will stay here again and recommend Westin San Francisco Airport for travelers and event coordinators.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:37:26.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
