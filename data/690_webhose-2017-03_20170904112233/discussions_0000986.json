(Eventi is walking distance to MSG) Eventi was amazing. Rooms are beautiful and very clean! Staff is wonderful, great experience from the moment we checked in. After the game, we went to The Vine for drinks, we were greeted and served quickly, even though there was a fairly big crowd in there for a Tuesday night. Drinks and dessert were both awesome. Sat at our table for closet to 2 hours and the waitress was always available when needed. Next morning we order Breakfast to the room, it came quickly and was delicious. Parking was easy and close by. All and all a great experience, would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:43:56.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
