The hotel is near Notre Dame, the Sorbonne and the Latin Quarter. Our room was small (I've heard most are in Paris!) but perfectly formed and modern. Bed was very comfortable. The best part of the hotel was the pool and steam room in the basement, perfect for relaxing after a long day of walking around Paris taking in the sights. Lots of bars and restaurants locally and an easy walk to Blvd St Germain (15mins) and the Louvre (25 mins) if you don't want to take the metro. We loved this hotel and would recommend it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:48:25.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
