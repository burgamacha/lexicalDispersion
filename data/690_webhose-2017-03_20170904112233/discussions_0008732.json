From the moment our cab pulled up we were greeted with big smiles and wonderful attitudes. Brought up to our beautiful rooms, they accommodated us with a 9am check in, what a treat after getting off an international flight. Super cozy beds, great showers, and so many freebies. On the first day the staff had already memorized our names, and some how they know as we are headed down the elevator and have your cab waiting, or whatever else you might need.\nFor my sons birthday they made it so special, gave him sparkling juice in the morning to celebrate, a custom cake left in the room in the afternoon (as he has food allergies), and left him and his brother a gift with a card signed from the whole staff in the evening. Who does stuff like that?!?\nFantastic breakfast with fantastic service, and a great lounge and location close to public transport round it off. You would be foolish not to choose this hotel, its a luxury home away from home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:28:15.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
