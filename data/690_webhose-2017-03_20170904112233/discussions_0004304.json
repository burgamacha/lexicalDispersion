Breakfast was a typical European continental, with coffees from machines, pastries, meats, eggs, toast, jams, yogurt. The metro was one block away and many nice restaurants in the area. Excellent location near Latin Quarter and Luxembourg Gardens.\nI am giving this hotel a 5 star because when we arrived at 8am, we expected to store our luggage and slug around (tired) for 6 hours. As it happens our room was ready and they let us in early with no charge. They did not have to do this and I would be surprised if that happened in the US. Also, she said our room was upgraded. I do not know why, it may just have been availability. The room was in front of the building, 5th floor, so it was quiet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:10:34.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
