In a city like NYC I need a convenient location & a clean room...not there for the hotel room! This midtown location with convenient subways & easy walking to lots of attractions is perfect. In the last year or so they've updated the rooms & they're always clean if small. But for a reasonable price I don't need large. The free breakfast is convenient, easy to grab fruit or a bagel and be on our way. The rooftop bar is awesome! Ideal for a nightcap & gorgeous views of the Empire State building around the corner. My only complaint is the slow elevators. But if we're on a lower floor we'll just use the stairs. I do feel bad for the hotel staff as there are no service elevators for their use, they have to use the public ones too. Unfortunately because of the age & design of the building I don't think there's a way to add elevators. That being said the slow elevators are not a deal breaker & we continue to enjoy our stays at the La Quinta Manhattan & would recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:43:38.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
