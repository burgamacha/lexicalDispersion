Close to the tube, with easy access to Heathrow and Gatwick, parks, shopping and museums. The area surrounding the hotel has lots of nice cafes and restaurants, a Waitrose accross the road and Partridges up the road. One feels safe in the area any time of day or night.\nMy room key didn't work on the gym door, but instead of getting it fixed, I went for a run around the neighborhood. I didn't return to the gym.\nMy room, on the sixth floor, was facing Cromwell road, which ment the occational wroom from some exotic car, but I still slept like a baby every night. Rooms are available facing the back garden, and those should be even more quiet.\nThe room was a perfect size, with space enough a really comfortable bed.\nThe staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful whenever I needed them.I would return in a heartbeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:59:08.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
