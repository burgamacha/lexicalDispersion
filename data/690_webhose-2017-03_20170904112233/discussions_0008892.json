The rooms were spacious, modern, fresh and clean with a huge TV and mini fridge. The large bed was comfortable and ensuite well equipped with a large walk in shower. The hotel has only missed out on getting a 5th star as I had to ask 3 times over 2 days for a kettle.I personally think a kettle should be a basic inclusion in any hotel room and although they have coffee in the lobby during the morning who wants to get out of bed and trapes down bleary eyed for a hot drink? Not me. All that said the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the locations great and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in midtown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:51:17.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
