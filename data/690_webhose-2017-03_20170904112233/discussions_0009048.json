I was warmly welcomed by Nate Chiarello who ensured that I was comfortable throughout my two day stay and went out of his way to accommodate my requests. Paul at the concierge desk personally accompanied me to my room and as there was a minor plumbing problem, he got it attended to immediately. Nate and Paul are an asset to the hotel because it is professionals like them who ensure that visitors return to the Grosvenor - I certainly will! My room, though small, was comfortable with a beige, red and black decor. The air conditioning was effective. Breakfast, served between 6:30 am to 10: 30 am was sumptuous. In the dining room, Mohammad and Despina were efficient and courteous. Undoubtedly, a very pleasant London interlude!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:35:51.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
