Has a great location if you want to be near Times Square and near the \"upper street\" Broadway theaters, and was very affordable given location. Room was very clean. Bed was very comfortable. And the pillows...I wanted to take them home with me (as a stomach sleeper I always love a soft pillow!). I've seen other TA reviewers who thought the rooms are small, but I actually thought it was a nice size for NY (I've been in much smaller). Breakfast buffet was very good. Had a minor issue with the concierge service, but nothing that would prevent me from going back. Novotel will be my go-to NYC hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:10:00.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
