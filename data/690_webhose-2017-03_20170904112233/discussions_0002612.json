This hotel is a bit pricey. These are some of the reasons why - some NY hotels can be small, dingy and overpriced. My room with king size bed is pretty spacious and laid out well. There is also a desk, 2 bed side tables, club chair and plenty of storage. The bathroom is modern and roomy - no tub, just a shower which is not an issue for me. The water pressure is good and plenty of hot water - important when it's blistery cold outside. Because the hotel isn't a conversion from an old apartment, the walls and floors are very solid - very little noise seeping through. And the room, including the wet areas, are clean. It's a pet peeve to see moldy grout or shower area when I'm paying so much. Not so with this hotel. The hotel also offer complementary gourmet coffee between 6-9 AM and an alcoholic beverage 5-6 PM.\nThe hotel is centrally located at the corner of 6th Ave and 30th St with three restaurants/bars on the premises. K-town is only two blocks away, walking distance to Empire State Building and Time Square. Subway entrances are also close by. There is also a gym with good number of machines & free weight. There is a spa but a bit pricey. All in all, the overall price is pretty worth it for what you get.\nLittle things to be weary of - I'm on the seventh floor and can hear some street noise in addition to the construction going on across the street on 6th Ave. It's not loud enough to be a show stopper but it is a little irritating. The AC can be a bit loud in the middle of the night. Luckily, it's cold outside and when I shut it off, the temperature in the room is perfectly cozy.\nOne of the better hotels in the area & I would definitely stay again.\nRoom Tip: Ask for as high a floor as possible See more room tips Green Features: Typical of most hotels now, this hotel also tries to practice green-ness. They will replace your towels & bed sheets only on request.
