Early check-in which they were able to do for me. :-)\nOnline I booked two single beds but the room that they gave me was one double bed. Since I did early check in I didn't want to complain but definitely need it two separate beds so I call downstairs and see if they had two singles available since that's what I registered for, they were easily able to make the change for me. Very accommodating.\nAlthough small, the rooms are very clean and doable for two people without lots of baggage or a parent and one child. Walls are thin, you can hear everything!\nThey have free Internet. They offer 80+ version of that for 299. We also have breakfast, which I did not get so I can't tell you anything about it.\nOverall I really like the place! Definitely would recommend it for travel on a budget.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:14:31.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
