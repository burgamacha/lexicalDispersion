The hotel itself is in a great location and easy to get around London due to not only its proximity to Waterloo Station but its close to Waterloo and Embankment bridge which makes access to Tourist attractions really easy. There are lots of places to eat and drink around the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel but had a couple of drinks in the bar area which was clean and again helpful staff. Room was slightly smaller than other premier inns we have stayed at with only a small window but this wasn't a problem for us as we were only sleeping there , the bathroom was small with only a shower but it was extremely clean. I would recommend this hotel as a great base for either business or leisure and we would quite happily stay there again\nRoom Tip: I imagine if you request a high floor the views are superb See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:15:45.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
