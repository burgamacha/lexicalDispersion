Big comfy bed, quite modern and bathroom was modern and clean. Minor negatives about the room it was quite small/compact and the shower wasn't the most powerful.\nFor our 5 days in new york this was the perfect base for us, it is a 30sec walk to the centre of time square. Got a decent nights sleep every night, check out was easy and the hotel staff were very helpful organising our transfer to the airport and kept our bags for the day until it was time to leave.\nWould definitely recommend paramount to anyone visiting new york.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:11:34.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
