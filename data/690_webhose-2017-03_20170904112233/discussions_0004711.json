When we checked in, Alla at the front desk was super friendly and gave us a corner Times Square king room up the 65th floor of the Residence Inn, (Room 6505) and a city view king room up on the 24th floor of the Courtyard. (Room 2402) Both of the rooms were amazing, but I preferred room 6505 since it felt larger and had an amazing view! We never wanted to close the curtains at night! The other staff members at this hotel are amazing as well and super friendly! The best part of the hotel is that it has no hidden smells or odors, as everything is really well taken care of! I would without a doubt stay here again the next time I come to NYC and I recommend this hotel to anyone in the area! This is our go-to hotel in NYC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:27.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
