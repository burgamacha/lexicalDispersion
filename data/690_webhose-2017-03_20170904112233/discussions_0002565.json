It was a spur of the moment trip to see Rome with my recently bereaved father and we wanted to stay in a non- corporate friendly place with high level facilities and a good class accommodation. What we have found has been a place we will definitely look to return to again. Maurizio and his staff welcomed us with professionalism and warmth. The apartment was first rate and set in a 1940's style hotel with first rate gardens and self contained apartments. Ours was clean modern, comfortable and well laid out. We took advantage of the guided trips around both Rome and along the Appian Way. Both were fascinating, in depth, original, and fun. I will certainly recommend this place to family and friends going forwards.\nRoom Tip: We did not try other rooms but our apartment on the ground floor was excellent.
