We love the place, from the luxurious lobby, stylish bar, comfortable quiet room to rich breakfast- everything was perfect, and price logical. The location is right in the center, with many cafes and cozy small restaurants around, 5 min walking to Cite island, 10-15 min to Louvre and Comedy Frances. The subway station is opposite of the hotel. I would like to thank all the hotel staff for making us to feel \"special guests\", everyone was polite, smiling and warm. Needless to say that all of them speak English. Thanks Novotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:43:06.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
