Any requests or problems encountered were dealt with promptly and efficiently. I have stayed in this hotel twice. The first stay was in a room directly below the Executive Lounge. Every early morning there was furniture screeching right above the room. I complaint and the next day it became a calm oasis. What did they do during the breakfast times in the Executive Lounge I have no idea. Bravo! Excellent problem solving and customer oriented attitude.\nCheck in and check our were swift, despite a sizable crowds of guests. Staff were courteous.\nThe leisure facility was first class, especially the fitness room where it was even equipped with tyre lifting and MMA rope. Swimming pool was wee bit shorter in length but it was beautiful.\nRoom amenities were great. Absolutely loved the Bluetooth operated Bose mobile speaker!\nLocation wise, close to 798 Art District as well as some good eateries.\nDefinitely a hotel to return to.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:48:02.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
