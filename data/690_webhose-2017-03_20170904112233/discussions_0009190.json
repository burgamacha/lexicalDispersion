You have to call for an iron and everything is just a bit plain.\nBUT, this is a cheap (ish) city centre hotel with a comfy bed and if you only want to put your head down, it's perfect. Literally a minute from Euston station and only 5 from more restaurants etc then you can shake a stick at. If you want bell boys and thick carpets etc. they are all available in London but this fills the brief perfectly as a budget hotel on a great location.
