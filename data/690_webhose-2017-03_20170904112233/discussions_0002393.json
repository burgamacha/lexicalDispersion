Valet was easy considering there are three hotels in a line on the street. The hotel is in a gear location. Across from Port Authority. A block from the heart of Times Square.\nMy only complaint is the fee for Valet parking. On the website it says $55 / $65 for oversized. I drive a Jeep Compass in no way is that an oversized vehicle. Not to mention because of the marathon valet took over an hour to get cars. Nothing was offered for that inconvenience.\nOther than that the stay was pleasant, beds comfortable and toiletries actually good. The shower was amazing! Very clean and spacious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:56:16.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
