Great location just around the corner from Times Square, however in our room near back of hotel there was no street noise at night to affect our sleep. Price was fantastic given the location, the breakfast was very good for a budget to moderate level hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful and the beds were comfortable. Only downside is the size of the room - with 4 of us with suitcases it was a bit of a challenge storing things and getting around the room. But we were only really in there to sleep, so this was a minor issue far outweighed by the positive aspects of the hotel. Will definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:17:42.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
