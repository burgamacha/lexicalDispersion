You know what to expect from Ibis- an upscale dorm room. The service was professional, save for the facts that a maid entered our room while we had a \"do not disturb\" sign on. Also, for those of us from the USA, note that there is no control of your room temperature during the tween months- after they shut off the heat and before summer air conditioner season. As a result there is no fresh airflow so you will need to ask the front desk to unlock your window. The neighborhood is average. At night be careful as it is near Pigalle. Overall a nice experience save for the maid issue. As a result I would not keep valuables in the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:46:35.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
