Not a great street and I wouldn't walk around late at night as it's a bit shabby but with access to the subway and close to all the sights of downtown you couldn't fault it as a comfortable base for a sightseeing visit to New York.\nThe bed was super comfortable!! The views from my room were wow, the bathroom was very clean.\nI didn't eat in the hotel or use the gym but staff were very helpful.\nThey have an airport taxi service too and I had a really professional driver called Juan who was very interesting company and a very safe driver.\nOverall, good value for money and I liked being close to the shops and restaurants of SoHo & Tribeca and on a few really good subway lines. Wish they could improve Canal St though!! Highly recommended overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:53:32.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
