Fabulous location just near Harrods and all the museums, but in a very quiet street.\nOne of the best hotels I've stayed; all the benefits of a small hotel with absolutely no compromises. Lots of small personal touches such as complimentary hot chocolate and cake in the afternoon, sweets and delicious biscuits for you to help yourselves to at reception, fruit platter in the bedroom, candles lit in the bathroom with the turndown service the list goes on.\nIf you want a luxurious stay in London with value for money then I would highly recommend The Egerton House.\n*although we came by train, they will pay the congestion charge if you are driving.\nRoom Tip: Room 44 was very quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:43:17.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
