This hotel is a one-off, not part of a chain, and it has a comfortable old-world feel. Rooms are not large, but they are certainly large enough as well as well-designed, comfortable and clean. My request for no scented cleaning fluids was honoured, though it took two requests to get an extra pillow. I agree with another reviewer that a coffee machine in the room would be nice - it's pretty standard these days. However, across the street is a nice little deli where coffee is available. Lobby staff were helpful, and the hotel has a old-style and very informative concierge at a desk in the lobby, which even in the days of Google can still be a very useful thing. The location is unbeatable - we were in New York to attend the Metropolitan Opera, and the hotel is a 20-minute walk from the opera house - two subway stops if you're not feeling like walking. The area has some decent restaurants and feels safe and about as quiet as New York gets! There's also a nice restaurant on site. It's also really close to Central Park, so about a half-hour walk to the many museums on the other side of the park. No hotels are cheap in New York, but in February this was very good value. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again another time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:22:40.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
