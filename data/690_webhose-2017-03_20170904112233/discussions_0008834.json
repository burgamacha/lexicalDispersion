The food was delicious and the menu quite original. From the savory entrees to the delightful sandwiches and brioche baguettes to the wonderful sweets - especially the clock! - it was all even better than it looked!The service, compliments of Sandoz, was gracious and accommodating. So glad I booked when I did, it sold out shortly after and we were told there's 2 1/2 thousand (!!) people on the waiting list!\nMy only complaint is that there was no discount offered for children as I would have loved to have brought my young granddaughters!\nHopefully this will be a regular spring event, as we would go again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:28:44.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
