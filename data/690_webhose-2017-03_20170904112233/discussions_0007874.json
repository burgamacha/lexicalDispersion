All set for 3 days of business accompanied by my wife for some sight seeing and Theatre. Unfortunately trip was marred by chaos at breakfast time on every day - There were insufficient staff on duty to set places and the wait for tables and for the single coffee machine was almost like a scene out of Oliver. Not once were we ever offered tea or coffee whereas some tables were. Focus seemed to be mostly on closing breakfast as soon as they could without providing decent service. On each of our 3 days there was no cutlery or correct settings. Breakfast was like a rugby scrum with minimal staff. On top of which the lifts only worked sporadically and were out of service adding to the queues for breakfast. Overall demeanour of the breakfast staff was haughty and unapologetic. In view of this decided to dine out both evenings rather than try the hotel. A great shame as room was excellent and other Hotels in the group such as Reading have always been very good with excellent staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:54:38.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
