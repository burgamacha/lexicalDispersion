Our bedroom had a great skylight through which we could see birds taking flight in the bright blue spring sky. An aeroplane in the distance leaving a vapour trail as it bid Paris adieu. And the sublime mattress and silence of the neighbourhood made for the best two nights sleep that these native West Londoners have had in months.\nThe hotel is created from a former textile factory. It has a great reception area that doubles as a funky lounge and breakfast room. Facilities include exercise room with spa. We did not use it but they have an Honesty Bar in house and a truly wonderful wine bar right opposite.\nThe atmosphere is cool, cosy and casual. The scent of Paris Fashion Week has all but gone, but for the trendy fashion-set this is no doubt a regular destination. I too hope to return to a bijoux hotel with a massive heart thanks to the great staff that made us feel at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:39:32.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
