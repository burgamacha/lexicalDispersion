We were looked after magnificently, and I can't praise the staff highly enough. They coped admirably with the needs of each of the group. Particular high points were the evening dinner reservations - each restaurant recommended was excellent, close enough to walk to and expecting us. Also the guide they found for us for a tour of the Colosseum and Forum - highly recommended. Very good breakfasts on the top floor, with the option of eating on the terrace (weather permitting). The location is very central, but hidden away in a back street. Good views of the Capitoline Hill if you go right to the top of the terrace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:30:03.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
