It was close (1 block) to the Metro station. We used the B Line every day and it took us to all the places we wanted to see. It was right there between Little Italy and China Town so there were places to eat no matter which direction we walked.\nThe hotel itself is nice and you can tell that it has been updated recently. The bare floors that others have noted is a nice thing, especially if you are creeped out by old carpet. The tile floor in the bathroom is heated! We found that the window in the shower area was nice. It allowed natural light in and a useful shelf area. The room itself, we had a two queen bed room, was a bit tight but we knew that in advance and it is New York. We appreciated the small sitting area and full sized viewing mirror.\nWe found the breakfast to be pretty good. There was fresh fruit, good coffee, and many options. I would suggest getting there early for the best selection. The front desk staff was always cheerful and very helpful anytime we asked for assistance.\nWe definitely give it a two thumbs up review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:32:37.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
