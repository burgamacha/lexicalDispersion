The hotel has been recently renovated and the bathrooms are absolutely beautiful, with an impressive mosaic of Manhattan boroughs in the shower. It is definitely worth it to upgrade to one of the suites with high ceilings (the highest I have ever seen in any hotel!). It was beautifully designed in terms of industrial and plush/velvet furniture.\nOn the same block as the hotel, there are my FAVORITE organic/smoothie places in the city: Wicked Juice, Sun in Bloom and the Juice Press.\nI had a wonderful stay both times. The staff has been so sweet and accommodating + the suite rooms are exceptionally spacious and beautiful. I highly recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:16:20.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
