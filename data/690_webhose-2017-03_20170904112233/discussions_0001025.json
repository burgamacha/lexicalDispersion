I didn't like the glass door to the bathroom ,it doesn't give much privacy. I was also told I had a bay view (I asked for it to see the runway ) ,but it was only partly bay view,we didn't see much of the runway\nThe gym and pool was nice ,wifi worked ok\nThe bar in the lobby looked nice ,but we didn't try it at it was very crowded because of a conference all the time\nM Lounge : very good afternoon service and breakfast ,but I don't understand why they have placed it in a corner without a view . It wasn't the nicest M lounge design I have seen either ,but again ,it was good", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:29:35.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
