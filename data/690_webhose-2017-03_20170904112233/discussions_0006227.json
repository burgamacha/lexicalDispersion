The hotel was warm, clean, and welcoming. Our rooms were small, but warm and cosy with with clean ensuite facilities. The rooms had a small table and chairs, so you could \"picnic\" here nicely. The staff were all very welcoming, and appreciated our attempts at the French language which, I think, encouraged them to help us. We visited out of season, so the area was less busy, but we were surrounded by great small family -run restaurants and we enjoyed great food and atmosphere. Great value.We were never made to feel uncomfortable in the area. Coming from CDG take the train to Paris Nord. It's about 15 minutes on foot. ( avoid difficult taxis) Next visit I will take a travel kettle, though the buffet breakfast wast lovely, and good value,I like a caffeine fix when I wake up.\nRoom Tip: a bit of noise in the night, but this is Monmartre!..at least the windows open for fresh air!
