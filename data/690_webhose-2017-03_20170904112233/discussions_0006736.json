The manager greeted us asking if we would like coffe, tea, or water and chatted with us during check in. He told us our room was not ready but took it on his own to search, make a phone call, and put us in a room that was ready. Staff showed us to our room which was pristinly clean! I am quite the stickler for clean hotel rooms and I can definitely say The Nadler Victoria did not disappoint. Great bed, perfect shower, and efficiency kitchenette fully stocked with dish pack, tea kettle, glasse, mini fridge. Every time we would venture in or out of the hotel the staff greeted us and asked if we needed anything. I can not say enough wonderful things about this hotel and staff.\nThe location is perfect as well. It is situated right near Victoria station and there are many great eating options around. Nice pubs and breakfast options right outside the hotel. We will definitely make a return visit to The Nadler Victoria. Thank you for making our visit such a wonderful experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:06:20.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
