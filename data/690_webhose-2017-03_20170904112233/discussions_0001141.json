It is charming and warm, with excellent service throughout. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite on the top floor. It was very comfortable for our family of three. Breakfast was included with our reservation, and it was very nice. Special compliments to the concierge, Pascal, who arranged reservations for our three dinners. Each restaurant was nearby, within walking distance, offering exceptional service and quality. Thank you St. James and thank you Pascal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:09:56.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
