Came for business, but since we are right across the street from the Gershwin theatre, we were able to see a show after work!\nRooms are small, but super efficient and clean. Full size window with adjustable blinds in every room is a fun touch. Huge drawer under the bed allows for a ton of storage so your luggage isn't in the way. Complimentary water in mini fridge and toiletries. Branding overall is clever, and it's fun to continue to find their fun copywriting in small places.\nEven though it's small, there is still adequate space to do work at a desk comfortably. If you have to meet during the day with another coworker for a call as I did, it is very hard to find a quiet place to go, as the entire lobby is an open and bustling place.\nI'd love to be able to come back in a warmer time of the year so I could enjoy the rooftop bar and it's views.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:12:13.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
