The price is very reasonable especially you visit there with a family. Our room is a suite with a sizable sitting area and bedroom. The size of the room in this area is comparably good size (as we stayed three hotels before.) The three seater sofa is reasonably big and soft. We are big fans of musicals, the theatre of Sunset Boulevard is just down stair. It is just a five mins walk to Rockefeller and 5th Ave. It is very appreciated that during our stay as my daughter was very sick, the cleaner helped us to do the cleaning twice a day and the receptionist helped us to call for a doctor in a minute.\nRoom Tip: Corner room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:38:58.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
