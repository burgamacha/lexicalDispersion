It turned out to be so much better than anything I expected!\nThe rooms were beautiful and spacious. Unbelievable space for a hotel in Manhattan. The kitchen is fully functional with a stove, oven, microwave and dishwasher, and also stocked with crockery and cutlery. Flat screen televisions in both rooms and housekeeping every day. The bathrooms were lovely and impeccably clean, with a bath and shower, and stocked with toiletries. I was on the 15th floor and got a decent internet speed too.\nThere is a Q line subway station just a few steps away along with a grocery store and a 24 hour pharmacy amongst other things.\nThe best part about the hotel though is the staff. Every single staff member I interacted with - reception staff, housekeeping and the doorman were lovely, warm and extremely helpful. Every time I needed help or had a query, assistance was provided within seconds.\nFantastic job guys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:12:34.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
