No bar, but it has a ingenious vine vending machine and small place to sit down and relax in a mezzanine above the reception.\nSmallish rooms but very well design. Very stylish interior. Very good for couples, but I would not recommended for families as this hotel is very small. No parking at the hotel; there is some street parking, but you would have to be super lucky. Great staff, very helpful and friendly. Very good breakfast. Good value for money\nRoom Tip: We stayed in Le Carres room and had balcony and view of Louvre See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:12:49.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
