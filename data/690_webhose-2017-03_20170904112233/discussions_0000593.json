The room was very clean. We really enjoyed the wine, cheese, crackers, tea and coffee etc. and the nice breakfast. All was included. The staff was so friendly and helpful. After we check out they offered to hold on to our luggage while we attended the afternoon play. I am looking forward to my return visit to this hotel.
