For that reason, I can't dog the place.. I really really loved the staff, location and main areas.\nThat said.... I was so disappointed in the room. The room was super small- I mean, super small even for NYC. The furnishings were fine, but the walls were so badly scraped and nicked- likely because the room was so small (nowhere to move). The bathroom was also very small and cramped. I think the SoHo location can't be beat- I just think the hotel's really high rating gave me a different set of expectations. I think this hotel caters to more of the 35 and younger crowd- not that anyone was less than kind- I just felt I was in more of a Millennial experience.\nI would consider this hotel again if looking to stay in the SoHo area for fun- would not recommend it to a business traveler or anyone looking for some space to spread out!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:02:01.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
