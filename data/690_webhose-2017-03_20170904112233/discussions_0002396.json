The location can't be beat, we walked everywhere or took the metro from grand Central (just 2 blocks away). Comfortable beds, slept very well. Entire staff was very welcoming and helpful. We recommend the Iroquois and would stay again. Two things to note, there is no coffee maker in room, they do offer complimentary coffee and fruit in the lobby, and avoid ordering top shelf martini at the little bar in front of check in desk (my small-ish drink was $23). Overall, a wonderful stay, we loved it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:03:51.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
