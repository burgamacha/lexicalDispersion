Location is great and allows you to walk to most places (and if not there is always a tube or a bus nearby). It has become my preferred choice for London recently. Accommodation in the capital can be random and prices very high so this is somehow a compromise. It is not cheap but at least you will not be disappointed.\nThe rooms are good (although the small ones can be very small!), beds and pillows very comfortable and the big windows always a pleasure in a city where the weather tends to be grey. There is no noise even if you are in the middle of the city. Wifi works nicely and the food is good. Staff are generally friendly and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:24:07.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
