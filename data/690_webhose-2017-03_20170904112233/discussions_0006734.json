However, it goes a bit downhill from there.\nThe room was clean and big enough, with comfortable beds. However, there was no minibar or fridge, either of which would be considered a basic amenity in hotel rooms around the world. There was only one small window in the corner of the room, which meant that there was little natural light (although we had a great view of the Empire State Building).\nThe room was unfortunately not sound-proofed, and we were awoken early every morning by the cleaners and other guests talking very loudly in the corridor.\nThe corridors are very dark and dank. They look like they haven't been changed since the hotel first opened it's doors. They really need to do something about this.\nIt wasn't too expensive for that part of Manhattan (around 1250 dollars for a week for 2 people), and is perfectly situated beside Penn station and Macy's. However, next time I think I will try somewhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:42:40.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
