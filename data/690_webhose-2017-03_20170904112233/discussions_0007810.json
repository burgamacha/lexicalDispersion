Before our trip we read other reviews that the staff were very helpful, and no doubt they were. Excellent service from first second. 3 of us were unfortunate to suffer a bad tummy bug, and one of our children was sick in bed and over the bathroom floor. No problem though as this was dealt with quickly by staff. When dining the kids were given paper and crayons and their meal was served quickly, before ours. Again can't thank the staff enough for their professionalism and kindness. It would be nice with a small fridge in the family room, as traveling with children a cool drink or snacks is always nice to have handy. The room was large enough, we've stayed in other hotels were the family room was much smaller, this was good sized. Next to the parking there is a small public park with a slide and climbing frame, nice for all family.\nRoom Tip: Our room faced the parking/park which was quiet.
