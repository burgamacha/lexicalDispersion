We had a great stay. The hotel was quiet and out of the way of the hustle and bustle. Paying car park next door charges Â£18 per night. Was a lovely quiet small premier inn. Breakfast superb. Nathan who works here chatted to us each morning over breakfast and talked to us about our day and plans and was really helpful. Can't wait to stay here again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:17:45.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
