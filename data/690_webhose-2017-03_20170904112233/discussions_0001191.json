We were not let down! We were greeted by super-friendly staff and the room was very nice. The location is just a couple of minutes from the Metro.\nThe area is a bit shady - in the middle of the \"red district\". Moulin Rouge is 1 minute from the hotel, and the street Moulin Rouge is on contains probably a hundre sex shops. But if you go just a mnute or two in any direction from the main street, the area has lots and lots of super-cozy cafees, restaurants, bars and so on. Many of them are some of the highest ranked on Tripadvisor.\nWe would definately come back to this hotel if we went back to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:31:33.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
