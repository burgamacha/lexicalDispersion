Outside the streets are bustling and freezing, but once inside you feel like you're with old friends in a safe haven. The friendliest hotel staff we have ever encountered. The continental breakfast served on the 2nd floor was top notch. Unlimited and top quality pastries, bagels, boiled eggs, juices and an exotic Italian Espresso/Cappucino machine. The attendants are very helpful, and took care of toasting our bagels and bringing them to our table. Due to our schedule was not able to attend the evening wine/cheese receptions. One caveat to note is that this space is so warm and inviting that people tended to linger with the complimentary newspapers and coffee and at times there was a shortage of tables, so be prepared to perhaps share your space with others, or to take your food back to the your room. I guess it depends on the day and how late you go down for breakfast. This was a great value enhancer and convenience - saved time and a lot of money by having breakfast at the hotel. Communications prior to arriving were helpful as well. We accepted their offer to arrange for a car service to pick us up at the airport, which did not cost much more than a taxi fare. Very classy service, was waiting for us in baggage claim with our name on a board, and carried our luggage out to nice roomy clean SUV. We were not able to go to Tony di Napoli restaurant right next door, but plan to on our next trip. Highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay at Times Square. We literally walked everywhere, to restaurants, theaters, grand central terminal, empire state building, Rockefeller center, etc. Every evening upon our return from our busy days, hotel staff was there greeting us as we walked through the door. This was our first trip to NYC, and we felt like Casablanca took good care of us.\nRoom Tip: We preferred a lower floor so we could just walk down to the continental breakfast on 2nd floor.
