The moment we walked to the hotel, we were pampered with bottled water and nice treatment from the staff. I went out for a run at Central Park and when I came back to the hotel, they gave me two bottle of waters and a towel to wipe down. When it rains, they gave us the umbrella. Services are topnotch and priority here!\nThe hotel is so new, so high tech and beautiful.\nThe location is also very convenient. The room was being cleaned twice a day. I love the fitness center and the pool. They located on the top and you can view Central Park from there.\nThe Nespresso coffee bar is so wonderful as well. The room has the commercial Nespresso machine and very generous amount of different flavors of pods of coffee for guests to try. I drank until I could not sleep :-)\nI love this hotel!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room view of Central Park.
