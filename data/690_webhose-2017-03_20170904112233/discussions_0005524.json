Fantastic staff. Priscila at the reception helped us a lot and was really really friendly. Every staff member have treated us like special guests on their homes. Such nice care. Don't hesitate to enjoy the best breakfast in town. Although the Location was not the most tur√≠stical we could walk anywhere. Bus and Metro station are very close as well. Comfortable rooms and modern bathrooms. On our next Trip to Paris we will certainly stay on this Hotel again and strongly recommend you to do the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:40:23.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
