It's quite modern and the room was very nice. I particularly like the fact that there is a hard pillow provided in the room as it's given me some of best sleeps I have had in a hotel in a while. The rain shower is pretty nice too.\nLondon Bridge is just 5mins away and if your a foodie, Borough Market is just before. The Tate/Thames is also just across the road. Opposite direction from London Bridge is Waterloo (prob about 15mins walk but I've not done it yet.)\nI've booked the next 4 weeks here as it's pretty decent hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:39:23.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
