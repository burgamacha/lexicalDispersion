We enjoyed the rooftop pool every morning where the water was kept quite warm so it's good for recreational use. Very friendly life guard.\nThe room we stayed had the shared internal door with another room. Our neighbors were loud every night and the walls seemed not very sound proof. Take my advice and if the neighbors are loud just call the front desk - they took care of it (twice) and promptly. Don't get involved in a confrontation by asking politely to be quieter after hours.\nOther:\n-Free internet in the lobby only.\n-Skyline market across the street has reasonable prices on breakfast, coffee, smoothies and more.\n-Mexican restaurant in hotel is an ok quality but very expensive. I'd look around next time.\nEnjoy NY!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room without a shared internal door to the next room.
