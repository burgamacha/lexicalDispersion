We arrived at around 12.45 (check in wasnt until 2pm) but this wasnt an issue as our room was ready for us.\nIt took only about 5 mins to check in, we were then escorted up to our room (i might add the Hotel staff took our bags for us).\nI was very impressed when we got in to the room. It was clear this Hotel was looked after but also had recently had a refurb.\nThe room was very modern with a smart tv to which you could hook your phone up and watch TV or listen to Music.\nThe only odd thing was there wasnt a seperate bathroom area, this was on the side of the room...the toilet had a sliding door for privacy then there was a sink and on the other side there was the double shower (which was brilliant - not the pathetic shower heads you normally get but a large square rainfall head)\nThis being said it wasnt a problem for us and didnt change how we thought about the Hotel.\nWe were fortunate to have a room on the 4th floor which over looked the large Exhibition/arts building and tunnel (great for people watching)\nThroughout our stay the staff were very helpful and couldnt have done more for us.\nI could not rave about this Hotel enough.\nPros\nStaff\nRoom\nView\nLocation...the list could go on\nCons\nHaving to leave!!!\nI WILL be staying here necxt time i visit Rome and will recommend to anyone looking to go.\nGreat trip!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:38:20.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
