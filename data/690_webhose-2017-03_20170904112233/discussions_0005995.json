The service was very good, and the food lovely, the pizzas looked great. There is an ice cream parlour there and we couldn't resist having one on the way out. Prices were reasonable and the wine was delicious. No bookings in the Bistro which is a shame as I would like to book for our large family party at Christmas as I think the location and Bistro would be perfect for all ages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:42:52.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
