Louisa is very welcoming and gave us lots of info about local places, travel and places to eat when we first arrived. Daniel helpfully suggested a great restaurant for my birthday and booked it for us. He then even went to the restaurant in person to ask them to 'look after us' well! Vincenzo was also very friendly and helpful. We were surprised by the great continental breakfast with the option of hot omelettes and eggs everyday. We had an amazing week and can't wait to go back.
