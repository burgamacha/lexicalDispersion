The first impression upon entering is of the lovely lounge/bar area with a fireplace and cosy greenhouse kind of garden in the back. We stayed in a studio queen room, which was just as shown on pictures, beautifully furnished and decorated; very chique. Bathroom and shower is gorgeous! Everything was immaculately clean and well thought through down to the smallest details. The room was equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine amongst other luxuries.\nThe lounge/bar is cosy and calm during the day, and very lively and happening at night. The area around the hotel is great, lots of restaurants, cafes and bars you'll want to check out, and a very nice atmosphere in general. Venturing further afield, most of lower manhattan is easy to explore on foot from the hotel, with underground stations and cabs at the doorstep if preferred, offering easy access to midtown as well.\nWe thoroughly recommend treating yourself to a stay at the Ludlow - we'll surely be back next time we're in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:13:28.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
