Also, this hotel is small enough to allow for a truly personal experience. The Art Deco interior was lovely and we were charmed by the hallway ceiling outside our room which had small twinkle lights embedded that shone at night.\nThe elevator was antique, really only carrying one person (one AMERICAN- we tend to be more DENSE than Europeans)! But we had no problems with it.\nBe sure to book directly with the hotel. They give 10% off the lowest online rate and breakfast (we booked through hotels.com and they offered to switch it and give us the benefits).\nAll pictures on the website are accurate as well.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:25:09.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
