We went as a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 girls, 10 and 12) in February of 2017. We had a Junior Suite that faced the Via Nazionale. The room was big enough for all of us (had a pull out couch). There was a well-stocked mini fridge, a coffee-maker and a tea kettle and a lovely basket of fruit awaiting us when we arrived. Everything was clean and modern. There were USB outlets in the room, which was great. Beds were comfortable, temperature control easy to use and effective.\nThe breakfast buffet was amazing. SO much selection of cold and hot foods, an espresso or cappuccino on arrival. And then they come around with fresh mozzarella and fresh ricotta or maybe some tiramisu. Fantastic. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Fortunately, there is a work-out room available for guests that is open 24h.\nThe location is near the Termini station (we walked from there with our bags without difficulty) and the Republica subway station. Very easy to use public transportation.\nBut if you didn't want to use public transportation, the staff would surely call you a taxi. There was nothing they wouldn't do. The called reservations for us, suggested terrific restaurants and gave sage advice.\nI'd recommend this place to anyone. There might be more quaint places near a little piazza, but you'd be missing out on that breakfast buffet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:24:20.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
