The bars and contemporary decor were what drew us there. The hotel was everything we expected and more! The staff was super courteous and helped with every question we had. Our first night we ate at the on-site steak restaurant. My husband, who tends to be a food snob at times, was complimentary of the steak saying it was probably the best he's ever had. We both loved the sweet treat at night left behind after our turndown service. Even better was the adorable handwritten card and three tiered cake left on the evening of my husband's birthday. Thanks Archer Hotel staff for making this trip one for the memory books!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:35:16.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
