As the hotel was located a distance away from the tourist spots, a shuttle service was provided which was very good. The room was very comfortable and clean. Meals were buffet style, but very varied and very good. Our deal included the use of the spa, which we really enjoyed using. Our only regret was that we were there for a short stay, and would liked a longer visit!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:53:02.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
