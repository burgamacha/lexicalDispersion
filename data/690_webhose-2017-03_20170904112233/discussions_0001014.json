From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't be more helpful. The smell in the hotel is amazing. They even sell the air freshener.\nThe room couldn't be any smaller but it was perfect and the bathroom was brand new with all toiletries provided.\nThe bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in.\nWe had a look around the beautiful private spa but sadly we didn't have the time to fit it in.\nThe metro is a 5 minute walk to the hotel from St Germain de peres. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from La Louvre.\nThere is an amazing macaron shop in the next road which also serves food upstairs - Labadee.\nThe honesty bar in the hotel was cozy and warm. The framed picture of Mona Lisa was good fun for taking selfies.\nWe will definitely return to this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:21:45.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
