The broadway plays and multiple great restaurants are all within walking distance. We got a room with a view of times square it is a bit noisy as it is right beside the elevators however it is worth trying at least once as the entertainment of watching out the window is worth the price of admission.\nBreakfast buffet was very good with an excellent selection and the omlette station was great.\nWill definitely go to this hotel again\nRoom Tip: Rooms with view of Times Square are noisy but fun.
