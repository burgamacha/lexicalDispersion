The hotel is within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, MoMA and many other attractions. Two subway stations (Lexington Avenue/53rd Street and 51st Street) offer easy access to other parts of NYC, as well as JFK airport. I had a single room with shared bathroom, which was very clean and much more spacious than expected. There was a washbasin inside the room (i.e. no need to leave the room every time you want to wash your hands or brush your teeth). Our floor had four shared bathrooms, which were clean at all times. You can also see which bathrooms are in use from your room to avoid queues. Overall, the hotel feels very modern and even has a garden and a roof terrace.\nThe main drawback was the noise. Manhattan is bustling 24/7 and the windows aren't great at keeping the noise out. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to bring a pair of ear plugs. Also, some disinfectant for the toilet seat in the shared bathrooms and perhaps a hand dryer would have been appreciated.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:01:06.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
