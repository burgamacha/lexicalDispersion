Given the low price I was a bit weary that I had booked a hotel that I would regret. Far from it! It's a sweet little hotel in a fantastic location. Rooms are small but hey, it's New York...who goes to NYC to sit in their hotel room?! The hotel is in walking distance of so many attractions including Madison Square Gardens where we went to see Billy Joel (LOVED IT!)... it is also just a short walk to Macy's, Bryant Park, and perhaps 15 minute walk to Time Square.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the rooms are not overly spacious but our room in the 16th floor overlooked 37th street with a direct view of the Empire State Building . How much more New York can you get?! The hotel has excellent staff...very helpful, polite. My only complaint was the noise from the air conditioning unit in the room...very noisy when it cut in and hard to sleep through, but a pair of ear plugs solved that problem and I slept like a baby under the glow of the Empire State Building.\nBreakfast was included in the price of the room and offers a great selection for all types of appetites. As a celiac I had no trouble finding a healthy breakfast of eggs, ham/bacon/sausage, greek yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee/tea. The dining area is a little small and was very full each morning we went for breakfast but people shared tables and didn't linger, so we really didn't have to wait too long for a table to open up.\nI highly recommend this hotel. Its so conveniently located. When I return to New York again (which I am sure I will!) this is going to be my go to hotel.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on a higher floor that overlooks 37th street.
