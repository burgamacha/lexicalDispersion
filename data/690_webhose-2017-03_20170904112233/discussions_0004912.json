Our first night we were in a very small room just off the dining room as they hotel was full, but we were able to swap the next day. The rooms are typically \"cosy\" because it's Paris, but perfectly comfortable and very clean. The location was fab, right in the neighbourhood of Pigalle and Montmartre. Lots of places to eat and drink nearby, walking distance to Sacre Couer and close to metro stations if you don't like to do too much walking. The staff were so lovely. Free non-alcoholic drinks in the minibar too. Would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:55:44.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
