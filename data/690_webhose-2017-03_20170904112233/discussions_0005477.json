Found the dining area a bit on the crowded side with many guests in town apparently but not a major issue. Never ran out of food and there was always a place to sit.\nExcellent location close to anything in Manhattan with Uber, subway stations or taxis. Walked all over the place and the hotel was in the right spot. Nearby coffee shops and restaurants.\nFriendly staff and great modern decor.\nRoom and bathroom was rather \"large\" for NY standards and enjoyed the street view I happened to have.\nReally can't go wrong with this place and if you get a good rate, cannot beat it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:41:21.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
