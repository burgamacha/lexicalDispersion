As with all things in New York City, space is at a premium and they make from what they've got. This is true of the Viceroy as well.\nFurnishings are low and sleek, lots of warm brown leather, bold art and mirrors – and it works. There’s a pretty great rooftop bar, which was surprisingly spacious and uncrowded for drinks with the after-work crowd on a Tuesday evening. The views of Midtown skyrises and Central Park are awesome. Impressive selection of brown liquors for us scotch drinkers, so I was happy.\nMy room was tiny but efficient, and certainly comfortable if the bed is your main concern. There are no closets, which was weird, and instead they installed built-in cabinets around the bed. Yet, this room worked for me. The bed was really comfortable, and the little desk area served its purpose when I needed to get some work done.\nBig plus: the staff was awesome – really outstanding. From the moment I checked in until I left, they impressed me with their comfortable service, grace and humor. The concierge, front desk, doormen and housekeeping were all authentically friendly and accommodating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:24:41.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
