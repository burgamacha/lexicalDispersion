The decor of the communal areas was beautiful and the inclusive breakfast was excellent. The hotel is located around many Japanese restaurants but is only a short walk to find French or Italian options. We couldn't fault the location in terms of its vicinity to Parisian attractions.\nThe only slight disappointment was the room service, where the menu was limited.\nWe would strongly recommend this hotel to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:56:58.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
