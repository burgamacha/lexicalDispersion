Loved how there was a continental breakfast with the employees bending over backwards to help with your food. There were tables and chairs and sofas placed in Rick's Cafe that allowed you to talk with other guests. They also had Happy hour with appetizers and limitless wine. Microwave popcorn was in our room and we just had to call the front desk who immediately came up , took a microwave and returned it back on a silver platter. Also - when the safe did not work ,they sent someone up immediately to fix it. The decor was a little shabby but they continued the theme of Casablanca throughout. A little kitschy - but fun. Will definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:52:35.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
