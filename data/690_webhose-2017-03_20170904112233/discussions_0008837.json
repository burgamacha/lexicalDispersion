The checkin staff spoke English and were very easy to deal with and gave good service. The rooms are well fitted out. We had a court yard room but due to the cold did not venture out. The bathroom is behind a clear and partly frosted glass wall with no door. There is a curtain that can be drawn across for privacy. Bed was comfortable there is a bar fridge. Tea and coffee was provided but no milk. There was no parking in front of the hotel and taxis could not stop so we were dropped off down the road and had to walk back.\nBreakfast was great with baked options available along with normal toast and egg station.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:04:32.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
