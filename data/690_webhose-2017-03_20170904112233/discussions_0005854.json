I've asked for room with a view to the Eiffel Tower and the guy at reception told us that that we can have the room at 3pm.\nThe room/studio apartment was nice and clean (23rd floor) and Wi-Fi speed wasn't that bad. Bed confy enough.\nOverall experience 5+ apart the air con that wasn't working they way it should. Bed\nWill come back again and highly recommend - great value for money!\nRoom Tip: Best view from 23rd floor See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:41:06.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
