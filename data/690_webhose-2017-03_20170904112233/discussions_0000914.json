The room was very clean and suited our requirements. Breakfast was great. Danielo the concierge was on hand every day to help advise and arrange daily itineraries.\nThe location of the hotel was perfect for exploring Rome. I have been to Rome 3 times before and this is my favourite hotel so far. Excellent value for money. A wonderful experience again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:23:00.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
