My check-in experience was very good indeed and on arrival I was upgraded to a superior double. The room was very clean and I was offered fresh tea and or coffee on arrival too. Breakfast was also very good and the continental offering was substantial for my needs, however, a cooked breakfast was also on offer for a small additional charge. Overall the hotel was of a very good standard and in a nice area of Kensington with many pubs, bars and restaurant a short walk away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:11:11.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
