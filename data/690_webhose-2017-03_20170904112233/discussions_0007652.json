Location is amazing, next to Rockefeller Plaza and many businesses and restaurants. Room was too warm the first night, but that was solved by contacting the front desk. They sent someone who helped me adjust the heater.\nThe Hotel is historic, and there is a certain charm to staying here. Bathroom is modern and renovated. Employees are very friendly. Ryan from the front desk, was super nice! Thanks Ryan for making our stay really pleasant. He went out of his way to help us find restaurants around the hotel that were open late hours. And was simply a great guy.\nI will definitely keep coming back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:43:14.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
