Only a 10mins walk or you can take the 3 mins free shuttle from the Hotel. Very easy to access Any tourist spot from here. Service at desk has been Phenomenal. They speak Spanish and English without hesitation and give the best directions. Got a room where previous visitor had been smoking and they didn't even bat an eye when I asked for a New room. I have 2 more days to go and I know they will be just as wonderful. Will definitely be staying here again.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:17:44.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
