The personnel is nice polite and always ready to help! The offer for breakfast is delicious, you have free soft drinks in your room which is something you don't see often. In the lobby you have appetizers/macarons/fruits/nuts as well as drinks (soft d/coffee/tea) for free which is wonderful. The location is ideal to get everywhere on Paris. Metro/RER are near or you can just walk to the Louvres, Concorde, Champs-Elysees and if you feel it, even to the Eiffel Tower! Room is nice and clean like you would have it home! All good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:56:20.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
