It is very club theme but has a very relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant. We tried the ice bar which was great but a lot more colder then expected! Great fun staff very nice food and service. Room was lovely and great size for a couple as me and my boyfriend are in early 20's. Area isn't the tourist area but is a cheap location to the metro station which can get you to everywhere from there which is max 5 minutes walk.\nWould defiantly recommend !!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:02:43.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
