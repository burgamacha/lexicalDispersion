The Executive room is spacious, comfortable, very clean and the view from the 8th floor was wonderful. The hotel staff was very friendly, professional and helpful. The food was very good, both breakfast and dinner, with a lot of options. The hotel is surrounded by a beautiful garden that you can walk around. Last, the Johnnie Walker Experience Store at the lobby was a great touch as you can find a number of really good scotch whiskies, both from the brand and single malt distilleries as well as other spirits.\nRoom Tip: Executive Room as high up as possible See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:34:01.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
