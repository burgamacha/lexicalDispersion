I haven't strayed from the 8thA and my favorite hotel in decades. However, I was enticed by a great Amex deal so decided to go around the corner to the First A and the Castille. The Hotel has two distinct personalities. Modern and spartan and regal and old school. My first room, which had issues one of which was its tiny size, was in the new renovated section. No warmth and, as I referred, narrow and very little light. My second room? In the old section. High ceilings, big bathroom and shower/tub. Big seating area and wonderful windows with great light. And lots of closet space. Lobby Bar area was quaint but no good vibe/energy, considering the address. Fitness room was adequate. Staff was quite lovely, though and is the strength of the property. It begins with the Front Office Manager, Benjamin Piat. Attentive, gracious, overly accommodating, friendly and efficient. He would be the reason that I would stay there again - as I know that I, and anyone in my party, would be taken care of with the best of service. Perfect location, BTW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:56:32.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
