We booked through AmEx Fine Hotels and were upgraded to a roomy twin-bed suite with a view over the interior garden. Because we'd arrived early, the room wasn't yet ready, so the desk staff held our bags. When we returned our room was ready, with the bags in place and a lovely tray of fruits placed in the ante-chamber with bottled water. The hotel bar is cozy, well stocked and chic. Outside were tables with heaters placed nearby (it was late February and cool). Best of all was the staff, who were always friendly and responsive. I would certainly stay again.\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing the garden are quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:51:09.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
