Truly amazing made extra special when it snowed. We stayed on the 63rd floor.\nOur room was cleaned daily and to the most the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was varied, fresh and well presented, Starbucks coffee available from the restaurant for an extra cost, which came in handy when we were snowed in.\nAlso a great location for Central Park, broadway and time square , this hotel definitely deserves a 10/10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:32:45.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
