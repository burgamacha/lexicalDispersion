The concierge was very helpful in helping us to find parking. The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable, I had a great night's sleep! This hotel is very central and it isn't too far to walk to Pimlico which I think is the nearest tube. The breakfast was tasty and plentiful. I suggest going earlier rather than later on a Sunday when it is less busy so you can really get the full enjoyment. Great, attentive service from the breakfast staff. I highly recommend and would love to stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:05:15.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
