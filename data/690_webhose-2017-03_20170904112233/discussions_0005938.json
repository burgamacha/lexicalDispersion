We were not disappointed. This hotel is clean, modern, comfortable and the location was perfect for our 7 night stay to explore the city. The subway entrance is a short walk away, and the area showcases the diversity of NY. We felt safe and loved how Chinatown, Little Italy, the lower east side, financial district, and Brooklyn Bridge were all within walking distance. Staff were friendly and helpful - we have only good things to remember. It would be a natural choice to stay at the Leon Hotel if we have opportunity to visit NYC again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:32:05.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
