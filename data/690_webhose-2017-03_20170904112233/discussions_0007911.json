I am so happy that I did. The location is great for theater, restaurants and close to Rockefeller Center, Central Park and Times Square. We stayed in a corner room, room 1231. I was concerned about noise being close to Times Square but it was quiet with a view, The front desk staff were helpful with all our questions as we stayed 3 nights. I asked for a late checkout as we were running late and they obliged. Only negative comment is room could have more lighting and the pillows were a little too squishy but this is very minor. The lobby is beautiful with a business center and small store. The wifi is free and did not cut out and the elevators were quick. I would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a corner room, very quiet See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:50:14.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
