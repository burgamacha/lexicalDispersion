First, I've never stayed so long in any hotel and I was actually sad to leave - not my usual emotion to say the least. Second, the staff was ready and able to assist with any issues immediately to my stay optimal. Successfully. This is incredibly important. Third, the meals at the restaurant were delicious and satisfying. Obviously, the wait staff gets to know you so it begins to feel like home, they fix your meal in a way that pleases you, and there is that friendly banter that we all crave on long trips away from our native stomping grounds. If you like fresh juices, try the carrot, ginger, tumeric, mango morning drink - Super delicious and nourishing! I felt the buffet prices were a tad high so I didn't choose them but you also have a Starbucks Express bar if you just want a quick breakfast. Fourth, the pool was open early and fantastic. I love distance swimming and had the place to myself - oh yes, and not over chlorinated so you wouldn't want to be there! Plus, they have the fitness center of Aloft next door.\nI will definitely use this specific hotel whenever I am back in the SF-San Mateo area. I cannot sing their praises enough!\nN\nHIGH HIGH Recommend.\nRoom Tip: We had a Bay side view of the airport and our stay was very quiet and enjoyable.
