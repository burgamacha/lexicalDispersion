Our 4 night stay was a most pleasurable experience. We were upgraded on arrival to a penthouse room in the hotel annex called \"the view\" which afforded us a stunning view over the Spanish Steps. The room was very clean, spacious and well appointed, the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. All in all I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to visitors to Rome and would definitely return if visiting Rome in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:27:24.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
