It is very easily accessible from Heathrow airport. The Heathrow Express brings you to Paddington Station in 15 minutes. From there it is a short taxi ride to the hotel.\nLocation is one of the biggest draws to this hotel. It is located steps away from Buckingham palace and a short and medium walk from several of the great sights of London like Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens Harrods etc. It is a short walk to the nearest Tube station, the St James Park station from where you can pretty much get connections to anywhere in London and beyond. You can even purchase your Oyster card at the convenience store next to the hotel. There are several pubs, restaurants, coffee shops and the lovely Pret Manger (love their sandwiches) within minutes of the hotel.\nHaving stayed in Taj hotels all over India and being members of the Taj Inner Circle, we have tasted and savored the Taj hospitality for several years. This hotel for the most part did not disappoint. The moment you arrive the hotel staff take over - from the door man to the concierge to the front desk. We had arrived early and they were very accommodating about getting us a room ASAP. After a long international flight the first thing you want to do is get to your room. Kudos to the front desk team who were updating us about our room status periodically.\nOur Junior Suite was lovely. It had a spacious sitting area with coffee/tea service, desk, comfy couches... The bedroom was very roomy with two large windows and great lighting. The best part of the bedroom was being awakened every morning by birds chirping out in the courtyard. There was a small dressing area and a bathroom that had a hot towel rack - warm towels on a cold day is simply divine! The bed was amazing, soft sheets and luxurious pillows - you just sank into bliss! One caution about the bathroom, the tub was a deep one so getting in and out of the tub one had to be a little careful.\nThe evening scene in the lobby was a lively one with happy guests mulling around and a wonderful piano player in the background. We had fun sipping our drinks and watching the folks. It was so nice to hear several languages being spoken, some we recognized and others we did not. This is why we come back to London again and again because it is truly an international city.\nMy only peeve about this hotel was the breakfast scene. We had breakfast at the hotel on three mornings and all three of them were stressful. One of the major joys of vacationing is coming down to breakfast and enjoying your eggs and toast in a leisurely manner. Here it was not possible. The breakfast area is cramped, the tables are too close to each other which made it very hard to get in and out of your chair. The wait staff seemed a little confused. We would wait for almost 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order for coffee/tea. The breakfast spread itself was adequate and at the rate they charged per person it was a shame.\nI recommend this hotel highly and will certainly stay here the next time we are in London.\nAnd last but not least, any hotel is only as good as its staff. I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Binoy Nair, the Head Concierge. He was very informative (recommended great restaurants and sights), attentive (listened carefully to our questions) and always smiling. Thank you, Mr Nair.\nRoom Tip: rooms overlooking the courtyard See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:31:35.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
