It's located on a busy street, but very close to St Germaine Blvd, Notre Dame, and Pantheon. Several metro stops close by and many cafes and restaurants. The University of Paris and the medical library are down the street. Accommodations are basic, but clean. Desk staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast for 12 euro in morning is option, but I recommend going to Boulangerie on Rue de Monge (Eric Kayser).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:35:55.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
