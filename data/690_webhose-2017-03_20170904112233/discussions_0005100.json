I was in NYC to go to a couple of parties for the weekend. The hotel was really cool. Very modern decor and exceptionally clean. The staff was so nice and helpful. They helped with all of my questions and the service was great. The room was very nice. I loved the workout equipment that I used in the mornings when I woke up. I also used the bicycles and treadmills in the hotel gym. The location is great. Right down the block from nearly every subway line and the Long Island Railroad which I took to visit my family. I highly recommend the hotel. Don't hesitate to book it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:11:06.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
