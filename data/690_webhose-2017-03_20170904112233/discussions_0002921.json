Access is via a buzzer, the lobby is all black, shiny marble and reception is on the first floor.\nAnyway, once we were in my fears were allayed. It's a nice hotel: quirky design and comfortable rooms.\nThe location is great, although, much like Soho in London, in Pigalle you're surrounded by sex shops. But the fact you're just a few doors down from the Moulin Rouge is pretty fun. And, even better, you're one street away from the heart of Bohemian culture, Montmartre.\nThe Blanche Metro station is right outside the door, too, which is really handy.\nThere are a couple of downsides, though: the bathroom wasn't completely cleaned every day, and the safe was broken. The room overall was clean and comfortable though.\nThe biggest issue - and this isn't really a surprise, given where you're staying - is that the noise from the street was pretty bad. We were four floors up and Friday/Saturday night Pigalle merriment was in full swing.\nOverall, this was a good stay and we'd recommend the place, but with a cautious note about the noise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:51:24.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
