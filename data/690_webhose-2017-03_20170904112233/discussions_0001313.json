To sit and watch from your balcony the Eiffel Tower twinkling every hour is an experience I can't wait to relive. Who knew the tower even twinkled !!\nThe hotel is in the best location ever !! A short stroll to your Segway office to go on the best tour of Paris. Everyone at every age should try a Segway. The hotel staff will happily print your vouchers for activities and help you make the best decisions for dinner. The breakfast served is everything you can imagine in a breakfast. Excellent!! I give the hotel the highest rating possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:59:24.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
