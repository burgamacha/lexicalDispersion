That was a hint I chose wisely. I just want to say the experience continued. Maria, Nichole, Yazmia, Bryan, Rex, John (so cute) Paul who I never met physically. I wanted to give him a mention because I spoke with him on the phone he was so professional and friendly. You have an amazing group of folks there. My room 1902 was so beautiful liked my view of the park, 2 queen beds and HUGE bathroom with separate Tub and shower. My friends stayed in 1602 and they were equally as happy. the hotel is modern but the warmth of the staff makes it so homey and cozy. Definitely recommend staying there.\nRoom Tip: Higher up better view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:22:25.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
