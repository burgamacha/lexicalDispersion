Friendly welcoming and helpful staff complemented the clean and comfortable room in a lovely quiet hotel. 5 minutes walk from Victoria Station so perfect location for exploring central London. Room was a good size, spotless, comfy beds, tea/coffee making facilities replenished daily, hairdryer, tv and great wifi. Great shower in immaculate bathroom. Fresh decor throughout with thick carpet ensuring quiet corridors.\nContinental breakfast with choices of cereals, juices, yoghurts, hot drinks and breads (with cheese, ham or jams) - would request swapping tinned fruit for fresh fruits.\nWould certainly recommend for anyone wanting a base in London for visiting the tourist sites or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:53:41.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
