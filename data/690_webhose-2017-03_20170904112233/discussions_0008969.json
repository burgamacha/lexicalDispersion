We use them by choice wherever we go for one very simple reason - you always know what you're going to get, and it's always good. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms are clean and spacious with showers that would put the average waterfall to shame, and the breakfasts are superb. When what you're after is somewhere predictably clean and comfortable to bed down after a long day out, in our view you can't beat a Premier Inn. And this one was well up to the usual standard. Thank you, Premier Inn. Look forward to seeing you next time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:32:31.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
