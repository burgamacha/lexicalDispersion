We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready, but they quickly offered to keep our bags while we toured the city. When we returned late afternoon, our room was ready and our bags were already in our rooms waiting for us. The lobby is small as others have mentioned, but that didn't affect us at all during our stay, and the staff was always helpful and pleasant.\nWe had a standard room on the 21st floor. No noise at all from neighbors or the street. The rooms are small, but have everything you need and are very clean. The queen bed was super comfy. Next to bed was a an ihome, so I charged my phone there. We too noticed that the plugs on the desk were a little loose, so we did charge one phone in the bathroom. However, they worked fine for the coffee maker, the hair dryer, and the iron (all supplied by the hotel) so maybe it was our plug. We did not eat up on the 7th floor, but did go up there to print our boarding passes for our flight home. The area looked nice and they were setting up for possibly a band to play on the Friday evening. Although not overly crowded, there were other people there. The hotel is close to many restaurants, multliple subways, rockefeller center, broadway, and time square.We would definely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:33:31.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
