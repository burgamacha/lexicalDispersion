There is parking available underneath the hotel which you have to pay for ( at a lower rate as a guest than for general members of the public). Headroom is limited in some parts. The hotel is located just off the Hammersmith flyover and is a 10 minute walk from the underground station. Having said that the rooms are quiet and clean. Good selection for breakfast with plenty of tea and coffee. All of the staff encountered were polite and courteous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:56:31.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
