Our room was compact, well laid-out, and looked like it should be pictured in a book of elegant, old-school Parisian interiors. Ditto our kids' room. You didn't even feel like you were in a hotel -- more like you were in the guest room at the chateau of a fabulously wealthy, old-money family.\nStaff were incredibly attentive and helpful. Before our visit they made a perfect restaurant recommendation for us (we don't really know the 16th) and reserved it for us as well.\nBreathtakingly expensive, but a great treat for our lay-over night in Paris. The only downside -- which could be an upside for some -- is that it's on the far edge of the sleepy 16th arrondissement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:07:52.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
