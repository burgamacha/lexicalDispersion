She found it on pretty short notice after the other hotel we had booked raised their prices. The hotel was very modern, with great decor. The breakfast buffet had a huge variety of fresh pastries and fruit. The hotel itself is within walking distance from all of the major sites and attractions, and there are a few excellent restaurants on the same street. The staff was very helpful and was even able to get us into a New Years eve dinner at a restaurant that we were told was overbooked!\nWe definitely recommend this hotel to anyone making a trip to Rome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:40:22.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
