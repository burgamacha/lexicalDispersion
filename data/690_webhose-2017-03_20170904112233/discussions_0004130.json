The hotel is epic - the epitome of what one would hope a historic NY luxury hotel would be. The service of the St Regis is extraordinary - and I don't say that lightly. It began the moment our bellman offered to unpack our luggage and continued through our entire stay. Our butler consistently came through (unlike other luxury properties we've been to where the butler comes to our room at the beginning, yet is never around when we request him/her). The lobby, room service, and housekeeping personnel were top notch and \"old world\" in the best sense - all seem to have spent their careers at the hotel. As far as accommodations, my husband and I were upgraded to a suite which was massive, lovely, updated and quiet. We booked two other rooms for family members and our daughter's grand deluxe room was large and lovely. Our family's entire experience at the St. Regis was perfection. We travel quite a bit and are fortunate to stay in top luxury hotels. I give the St. Regis my highest recommendation. I personally believe it is the finest hotel in the US - with service markedly better than the top rated ones in travel magazines.\nRoom Tip: Our corner suite facing Madison Avenue was extremely quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:56:09.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
