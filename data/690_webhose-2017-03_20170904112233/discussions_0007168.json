The staff were very attentive, friendly and professional. I got the feel that it was a family run place (although I could be wrong).\nI saw the offerings for breakfast and decided not to participate, €15 seemed a bit too much for the small selection of food I could see on offer. Although I can't really comment because I didn't try it.\nThe room was nice. It was small, but it's in a central part of Paris, very close to the Eiffel Tower. The other attractions are a train ride away, or a very long walk! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good standard, but as mentioned very small!\nThe cleaners did a good job, and the coffee in the room was very nice! Although the portions of milk was a bit hit or miss (if I had asked for more, I'm sure they would have got me more).\nThis is a small, but well cared for hotel, and rooms are €170 (or there abouts) each night if you don't book in advance. We didn't pay that much, so I felt as though I had bagged myself a bargain!\nValerie had been very helpful prior to booking and made sure the room that we got was just perfect for us.\nI read some other reviews about it being a noisy place, I heard some noise the night that PSG played, but other than that- not as bad as others would make you think.\nOverall... I was impressed and would make a conscious effort to try and stay again if ever in town. Best Paris hotel I've stayed in to date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:24:44.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
