The rooms are small, but well kept, which is not easy with older buildings and plumbing. However, the older hotels tend to have better sound barriers and noise is not an issue when staying in the Paramount. The elevators are fast, which is rare and wonderful.\nA couple of things that we did not like this trip was the scent that they pump into the lobby and restaurant. It is a very powdery and annoying smell, and we found it irritating and lingering. I purchased a small packet of tissues to take with me to the theatre and I had to throw them away because the smell was ridiculously strong, even with the tissues in my purse. The other thing was there were no bell hops or door attendants at all. If you needed assistance, you had to go to the front desk to request a cab or other assistance.\nWe usually book our travel as a package to include flights and accommodations, and the Paramount often has one of the best deals available. We will stay here again the next time we come to the city for a show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:06:20.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
