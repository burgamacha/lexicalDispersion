It's an old hotel, but the rooms are clean have been nicely updated. There are a variety of rooms available from those suited for an individual traveler to suites. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location can't be beat. It's 2-3 blocks from the hotel to the nearest subway station, making it very easy to get anywhere in the city. It is also located within walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants and we feel safe walking around the neighborhood at any hour. Valet parking is available for $51 for 24 hours, no in and out. However, you don't need or want your car because of all the convenient transportation options available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:17:27.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
