As many other reviews will tell you, sculptures, paintings and pottery is everywhere. The art is whimsical and odd and beautiful. My room, on the 16th floor, had an amazing terrace with leather sofas, that overlooked the mall. Each day, the rooms came with different candy treats, served under a little glass jar. There was a ceiling-mounted shower that was amazing and a fully-stocked toiletries box. Each morning, the hotel served a free breakfast that was generous and very good, with fresh fruits and pastries, meats and breads as well as an egg dish. Each traveler also got a free cocktail from George's bar and restaurant. The bar prides itself on its spice-infused liquor drinks. The wait staff is very friendly.\nThe location is ideal for tourism. It's a short walk from a big park and not too far from Tienanmen Square. It's a very nice place to stay in Beijing.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:09:28.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
