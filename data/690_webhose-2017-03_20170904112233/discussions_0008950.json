This stop became almost a week when a family member ended up in hospital with influenza.\nWe needed to find a hotel quickly and we wanted one near the train station. The hotel was small, very clean and in a great location.\nWe learned our family member needed to stay longer and we needed a larger place and for a longer duration. Darren was very accommodating in arranging for us to get a an offsite flat managed by the hotel. Darren. And his brother, I apologize but I forget his name Jason?? They moved us and our family member to the flat and we were very grateful for the transportation.\nThe flat was in a great spot. It wasn't perfect, but it met our needs. We had poor hot water, however Jason worked tirelessly to try to fix the problem.\nWe were very stressed being unsure if our family member would be clear to travel. Darren was very assuring and honest with how busy London was given the Queen Sapphire Jubilee.\nWe recommend this hotel and are very grateful to Darren and Jason. They are great guys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:35:32.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
