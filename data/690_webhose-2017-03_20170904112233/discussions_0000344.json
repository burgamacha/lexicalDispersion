The room was clean and large size with very modern decor. The nice thing about the room was we had two queen beds which is hard to find at hotels near SFO. Beds were very comfortable and firm (but not hard). The hotel room was little noisier than previous stays due to planes flying over hotel which was unusual and maybe attributed wind direction change at SFO. It did quiet down after 10:00pm so we did get a good night's sleep. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful in trying to satisfy your needs. The hotel offers complimentary parking. The shuttle bus service has improved over previous visits. The shuttle bus was right on schedule from SFO to hotel. I would recommend this hotel and plan to stay in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:01:30.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
