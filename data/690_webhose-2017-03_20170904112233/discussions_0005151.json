Time however simply did not allow for my usual luxury and we decided to have a few nights in London.\nI made my booking via booking.com and wanted to pay and upgrade my room.\nInitially, I was told by the team it could not be confirmed until arrival.\nWe arrived pretty late to a fully booked hotel, with much disappointment I could not pay and upgrade.\nUpon arrival to the room, although tired and a tad disappointed the room itself was clean and indeed everything one would expect (and more) for a 5-star hotel.\nThe next day we were upgraded to what I can say fully deserves its name to the 'wow' suite!\nIn honesty, both my partner and I would not have appreciated the beauty of this room had we stayed in it the night previous. It was also super appreciated that this was complimentary !\nI have only commented thus far on the room(s) but in fairness, the entire experience was 5 star.\nFrom the moment I walked into the hotel, the welcome, the drinks upon arrival even the barman was a welcome pleasure (and super funny)\nRoom Tip: The Wow suite!!
