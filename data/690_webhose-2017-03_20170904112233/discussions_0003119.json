But overall an excellent hotel in a prime location with excellent facilities, free complementary breakfast, free wifi and laundry facility. Discounted parking facilities opposite the hotel, you just need to get your parking ticket validated by the hotel to pay $40 overnight rate. The staff who worked at this hotel were excellent and very helpful to our needs before we arrived and after we did. THANKYOU for making our stay an enjoyable one.\nRoom Tip: High floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:30:21.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
