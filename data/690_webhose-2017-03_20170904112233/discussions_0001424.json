Great location.\nRoom was nice and clean with everything you'd expect apart from kettle, tea and coffee. Bed slightly on the firm side, just how I like it. Shower cubicle is a bit small, certainly not room for an inflatable crocodile.\nGood breakfast selection, including some very nicely cooked bacon. Ok so it was that streaky stuff that Americans insist on over cooking but, for once it was still soft and juicy much to the amusement of an American guest who had to take a photo of the \"raw\" meat!\nAll of the staff were fantastic, well turned out, professional and extremely amiable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:55:08.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
