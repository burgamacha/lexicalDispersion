Booked standard room through a last minute.com package which Inc Eurostar return ticket and overnight accommodation in a standard room. We arrived at the hotel and we were offered a suite upgrade for just â‚¬50 more. We got room 605 which is the best room in the hotel. We sat on the sofa with a glass of wine in our hand and the best view of the Eiffel Tower outside the window. Could not have been more perfect in location or view. Friendly staff and right in the middle of he action so everything is walking distance. Highly recommend. The room was huge !", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:24:10.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
