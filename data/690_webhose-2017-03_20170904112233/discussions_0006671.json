The city of Paris and the Hotel Le Marquis was our favorite! Then room is cozy, clean and you have a cute little window/balcony to look out the window. I've always wanted to visit Paris and after my visit the city was everything and more. The hotel is in a great location. It's on a quiet street with a grocery store across the street. When you're ready to go to the city center you can easily walk to the Eiffel Tower, cafes, etc. Also- not a far ride from Chanel. I'll be sure to go back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:17:53.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
