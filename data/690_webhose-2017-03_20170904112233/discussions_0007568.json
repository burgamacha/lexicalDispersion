There was no disruption to our stay and you wouldn't have even known the builders were there. We were the first to stay in our room (having only reopened the 5th floor the day we checked in) - the rooms are very compact but perfect for the purpose you use the room for, sleeping and showering in. The staff here are so friendly and helpful, including the housekeeping team!! The bed was so comfortable we had a great nights sleep. Only thing I would say is you wouldn't want to stay here too long or if you were heavily set due to how compact it is :) Just a 5 minute walk to Westminster and the London eye and other amazing attractions this hotel, tube station just outside the hotel and Charing Cross is only a 10/15 minute walk from the hotel. We will deff stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:12:28.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
