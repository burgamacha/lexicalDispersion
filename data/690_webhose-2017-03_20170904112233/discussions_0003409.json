At first, I was a bit concerned as it didn't have some of the typical stuff we see in hotels (like restaurants!). However, it is fantastically convenient to walk around the corner to the mall by Victoria Station where there are loads of nice restaurants ranging from pubs and brasseries to Italian and the ubiquitous Wagamamas. The rooms and hotel are clean, as one might expect since they just opened about one year ago. Not super spacious, but pretty typical in my experience with London hotels.\nThe standout is the service, which makes all the difference when one is on the road. Silvia did an amazing job of coordinating early morning taxis and even went to lengths to help me get a receipt when I forgot to ask the cabbie originally. Somehow, she seemed to be at the desk during my entire stay. When there were some issues with my departing cab (due to a demonstration and the resulting rough traffic), Francesco was extremely helpful in tracking down alternatives and then just hanging out and chatting while I waited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:10:08.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
