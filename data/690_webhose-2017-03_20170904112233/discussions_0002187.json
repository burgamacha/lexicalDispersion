The room are tiny but you will find everything you need, and the rooms are very clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they will do whatever they can to accomodate your request. There is even a mexican restaurant in the lobby with very good food, very convenient when the weather is not cooperating during winter. You can also grab a coffee and a croissant in the morning at a very decent price and served by a very friendly staff. This is at least my 5th stay with them and each time I enjoy it!\nRoom Tip: if you want some more space in the room book the queen pod See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:08:00.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
