Tickets for bus from ticket office outside terminal 3...kiosk on left is best.\nBecause of the uncertainty of getting back to airport we took train from Termini, 14 euros per person. You get the tickets from ATAC shop (there was a notice outside saying to go there but there was no sign outside shop. Anyway, the shop is immediately on your right going into the Termini from the taxi-rank side, facing North West. One of the posts said about getting ticket verified ...you don't need to do this just get on the train normally platform 23 or 24 every 20 minutes, it takes about 35 mins have your ticket ready when you get off to swipe through the barrier. By the way only get taxi from official taxi rank..we heard of a few horror stories. You can walk to hotel in about 15 minutes, head for via Nazionale (via Milano on left..hotel 10 metres down on your right) much better than going via via Cavour.\nHotel was great ...we were celebrating 50 years married and I asked for flowers in the room and for this to be put on bill. Well we got a complimentary Prosecco..just the ticket after your travels. The breakfast staff are very welcoming and the selection was very good and fresh. One evening we had meal in hotel ...staff again very friendly but the lasagne was not heated all the way through and the PLATES WERE COLD.\nWe visited most places by walking with exception of the Vatican(the queues were huge so glad we got tickets on line from official web site) which was by Metro.\nWe will visit Rome again and stay at this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:35:33.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
