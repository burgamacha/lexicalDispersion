The rooms are stunning, clean, and well-appointed. The garden is small but peaceful. The staff is considerate. Raymond Odima was an attentive manager; he was a wonderful communicator over email and also quite flexible in helping me host a last-minute meeting in their conference room.\nI definitely look forward to staying at Humura when I am back in Kampala. It's a relatively unknown boutique hotel I did not expect to find. Am so glad I did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:24:35.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
