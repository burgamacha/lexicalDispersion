Probably the best things about the hotel are the staff and the style. I had pulled a leg muscle on the way to Paris from Germany and was in agonizing pain after arriving on the TGV. We took a taxi to the hotel and after arriving, asked the front desk workers for the closest pharmacy. (Fortunately there's one right down the block that was able to get me French crutches and a bandage.) They were very helpful in recommending ways to get around the city in my injured condition, and the elevator was mercifully quick and the hallways to the rooms short. We had a double room that while small, was more than adequate by Parisian standards. Breakfast and snacks were good, although it could get crowded in the morning. The hotel is not far from the Metro, but it's on a quiet street with little shops including several model train stores my teen son enjoyed visiting. (Our taxi driver almost missed the hotel because it blends in so well with the rest of the street!) As for the hotel's style, it's quite modern and funky, with lots of color everywhere and interesting things on the walls in the lobby. We enjoyed the blue color scheme in our room and the beds were comfortable as well. When we left, the helpful staff secured us a wonderful taxi driver who got us to the airport with plenty of time to spare. We are returning to Paris in April 2017 and plan to stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:36:23.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
