This hotel was a very nice surprise. Though the exterior is being renovated (seems like most of the city is under repair), the interior is quite lovely - art deco style - very well preserved and maintained from the 1930's.\nOur room was updated, clean and very comfortable. The only negative is the bathroom was rather small. Also very convenient is a diner with an entrance from the hotel lobby.\nWe found the staff to be helpful and friendly. As a Wyndham Rewards member I was quite pleased with this hotel and would definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:44:38.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
