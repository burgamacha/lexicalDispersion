Firstly avenue kleber is positioned off one of the Arc de Triumphs 'stars', down one of the most elegant streets and neighbouring the rather more famous shopping street!\nHowever this still is not the highlight, which had to be a room side view of tour eiffel! See photograph.\nThe hotel is a 20 minute walk, give our take to the eiffel tour one-way and a slightly less jaunt the other way to arc de triumph.\nMetro stations are about the same distance, with the particularly handy Charles de Gaulle Etoile position just off the arc de triumph, with lines leading to RER stations, La Louvre, Notre-Dame and the beautiful monmarche area.\nThe hotel its self is small, but beautifully in its decor and is very clean and has its own wonderful charm, amongst some of Paris's more established architectural super stars.\nIt's a 3 star hotel, however it's easily a three star, it probably deserves at least another half star if that was possibly.\nThe hotel is manned 24/7, with pleasant, multilingual staff.\nThank you Hotel Elysees for being part of my Paris adventure, I will return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:21:08.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
