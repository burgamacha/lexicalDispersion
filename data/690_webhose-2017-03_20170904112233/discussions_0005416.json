Location to Times Square and Theatre District was great. Front desk staff, especially Anna was very professional, friendly and helpful. The Concierge was very helpful too. Room was small as is the norm for NYC but clean and comfortable, especially the bed. Had one issue with the room thermostat but it was taken care of immediately when brought to the staff's attention. Breakfast was good too and staff there was friendly as well. Also, had a late flight home and they were kind enough to store our luggage to allow us to enjoy our last day in NY before catching our ride to LGA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:42:46.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
