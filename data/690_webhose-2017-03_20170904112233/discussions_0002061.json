The hotel was smart, the rooms were very spacious and nicely finished with a great view of the Olympic flame. The buffet breakfast was very good except for the inadequate coffee machines that were more suited to serving a small office than a busy hotel. Apart from the good breakfasts (that were included in our tarif) other meals were expensive and of modest proportions. We did however find decent local restaurants further along East Changan street, 400m beyond the major junction.\nOverall a very good base for visitors to Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:20:32.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
