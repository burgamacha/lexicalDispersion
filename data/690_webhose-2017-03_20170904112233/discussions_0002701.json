Wifi wasn't great in our room, however, worked fine in reception so online check ins etc weren't an issue. A major positive is the near by metro station which is clean and feels safe even late at night, it is also very easy to use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:00:23.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
