It offers a unique experience for its guest and it very accommodating. It is quite challenging to find at first because it is located in a traditional hutong but once you find it, it is definitely a hidden gem. It is close to the subway line, the breakfast is good, the hotel staff understands both English and Chinese & are very nice, and restaurants are not too far away. The hotel also offers a free shadow arts puppet show that is not to be missed. Prince Kung's mansion is also only a 10 minute walk from the hotel and should be visited....it is an amazing look into Chinese history. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:19:02.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
