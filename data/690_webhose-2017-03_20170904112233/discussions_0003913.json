The concierage and front desk staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. If breakfast is not included in your room rate a short walk and you have limitless choices of cafe to delight. Shopping and sight seeing very accessible, a lovely park just around the corner. Hotel is not on a main road so very quiet. Curtails are real block out so room was very dark for sleeping. Rooms were very spacious by Parisian standards and well appointed, beds very comfortable and lovely toiletries provided. We didn't go to the pool but looks amazing. A great location, excellent service and a hotel we will come back to!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:42:16.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
