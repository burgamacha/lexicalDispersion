The location is perfect for walking to catch the boat to the Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island, an easy walk to One World Tower & 9/11 Memorial and a quick subway ride to the Tenement Museum. The Hotel Room was clean and comfortable with a great kitchen. The daily breakfast is very good; and we could bring breakfast up for the teens who were tough to drag out of bed. The hotel is in a historic building, but the interior feels almost brand new. The access to the subway is excellent and I would not hesitate to do a full week here - we only moved because we wanted to be in midtown for part of the stay so we had the option to walk as well as ride subways to Central Park etc, We only had 5 nights in NYC or might have taken advantage of some extended stay benefits for 6 nights or longer stays at this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:19:09.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
