Received a great welcome and we were delighted to be offered an upgrade. The room was spacious and quiet with a lovely view over Vincent Square. Had read some of the reviews and though yes, the décor may be a little dated the hotel is clean and comfortable, staff were all very helpful.\nWould highly recommend this hotel and will be checking out its availability on our next trip to London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:41:56.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
