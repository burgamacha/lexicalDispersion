This is primarily a business hotel that has all the usual amenities but also has indoor pool, ,hot tub, shoe shine, Hertz rental pick up, dining room , lively bar, stunning views of the bay, well trained staff and clean quiet rooms. Because the building is older and well constructed the airport noise is minimal.\nThe rooms facing the bay are worth a few bucks more because the airport comings and goings is mesmerizing entertainment . Hard to believe but it is. Walking distance to a few restaurants and a short drive to more choices if needed. I spent 9 days here and hated to leave. For high level Marriott reward members they offer the M Club that is open 24/7 and has drinks, hot breakfast , small entrees in the evening. All the rooms have been renovated and are spacious but limited storage. Pool ,exercise and hot tub are dated and need some care. There is a small patio with fire pits on the bay side of the property that are a delightful spot to watch sunset. Free shuttle to and from the airport that is also 24/7 is a huge plus. Only negative was the Wi-Fi that was spotty and fairly expensive if you are paying.\nRoom Tip: Bay side has better views and NO traffic noise See more room tips Green Features: the idea of reusable glass water bottle is terrific, also the recycle wastebaskets See all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:12:41.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
