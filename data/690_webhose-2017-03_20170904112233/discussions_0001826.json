The room and the hotel were as expected based on the age of the building. The executive lounge was efficient and courteous. The staff managed to remember our name. The food was fine but not super exciting.\nThis is the first time I stayed at this area. The location is actually very nice. Rows of Japanese/Korean restaurants were a short stroll away. Subway No.10 line was 5 minutes away. if you drive, it is close to the entrance of the airport expressway.\nOverall a nice hotel but nothing exciting. If a good rate is available, I will not hesitate to come back but there are a lot of choices in this price range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:57:28.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
