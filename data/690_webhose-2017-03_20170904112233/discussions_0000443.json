The stand out point for us was Laetitia at the reception! She not only greeted us warmly all the time, she was the unofficial tour guide for us and helped us with visiting multiple locations across the city along with the metro routes. The beds are very comfortable and the room though small, is very cozy and clean! The view from the balcony of our room was breathtaking! The breakfast is sumptuous and delicious and the â‚¬13 price is justified. One small niggle - the wifi in our room on the fifth floor was a little weak..otherwise a great visit! Highly recommended!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:54:09.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
