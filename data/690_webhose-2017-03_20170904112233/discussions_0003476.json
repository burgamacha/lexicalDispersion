As a rule I've good experiences at Hilton locations and with Hilton company. Hilton Times Square is no exception. It starts with getting in. You can enter either west bound on 41st or east bound on 42nd. The door man is quick and helpful and with a small showing of your gratitude can be a great resource for your trip. Once inside the lobby bar is on the 6th floor overlooking 42nd street and the famed Times Square. The rooms are clean and well kept and not as small as some other NYC venues. The subway is just steps from the front door and so much more... When I stay in midTown this is my 1st choice hotel.\nRoom Tip: If at all possible ask for a North facing room. That will have you looking up into Times Square.
