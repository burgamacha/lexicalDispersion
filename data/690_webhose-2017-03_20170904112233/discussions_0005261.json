From here you have the whole of Paris to explore. While we were here the hotel had some maintenance being carried out but it didn't disturb us at all.\nThe facilities offer everything you require. We had a rear room which overlooked the courtyard. Not the best view to look out at but you are in central Paris.\nWhen we next return we are specifically going to request a street view. Simply because I'm nosy and love to watch people. I mean why go to a Paris and not people watch and drink wine. That's what it's all about.\nOnce you step out the front door you have Cafes and bars outside the door. Just as a stop gap as course before venturing out to Palais Royal and the Louvre which are on the doorstep.\nLocal metro stations are all around you. You also have the shopping centre Chatalet Le Halles and the metro RER five minutes away.\nWanting a picnic on the Seine then there are numerous mini markets and wineries around to buy everything you need including ice for the room.\nGreat little hotel and great location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:10:57.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
