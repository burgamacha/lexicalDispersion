Since that hotel was sold last year, I decided to check out this new location. I like it even better! The prices for New York are reasonable and the rooms are newly renovated. I like the rooms to the courtyard, so I can have a quieter night's sleep. The staff makes all the difference though. They are just all so lovely and nice, from the doorman (Chuck) to the receptionists (Cat and Rachel and all the others). They really care. To top it all off, we had the most amazing dining experience at the Japanese restaurant \"o ya\". Probably the best Omakase I have ever had. And again, the staff there so lovely and nice. I will surely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:40:58.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
