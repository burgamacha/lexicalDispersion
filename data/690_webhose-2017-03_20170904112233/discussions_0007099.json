We were pleasantly surprised. Despite the room being small and in need of some modernisation the bed was comfortable. There was an Iron, Ironing board, TV, hairdryer and plenty of wardrobe space. Bathroom was modern. Hotel was located next to Times Square, close to the metro and easy walking distance of the cruise terminal. The staff are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and very polite. The customer service was beyond reproach. We were unhappy with our first room and they moved us with no fuss. We had a late flight home and we left our suitcases free of charge at the hotel for several hours. Even after checkout we could use a guest room for the toilet etc. Breakfast was continental and very nice. We would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: you hear less traffic noise on the higher floors See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:39:43.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
