It is small, not \"hooked into\" the major chains, and doesn't have the usual polish that you'd get from a Hilton/Intercontinental/Marriott. I like that, and really don't care much for the generic faux-glam of it all, so this was perfect for me. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the room clean and comfortable, if a bit spartan. But everything was available that we needed, including wifi.\nThe neighborhood is really the selling point: it's at the corner of Washington Square Park, and easily walkable to great neighborhood interests and restaurants, if it's not freezing (which it was when we were there, but there's nothing to do about it!). Metro/Subway is at the end of the block.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:56:21.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
