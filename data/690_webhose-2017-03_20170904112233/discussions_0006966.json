From the minute we checked in the staff were extremely friendly and so accommodating. I loved the cucumber water in the lobby. Our room was a decent size for NYC standards and spotless. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were just as comfortable. The bathroom was very modern with a beautiful walk in shower.\nThe lounge was a great place to unwind and hang out for drinks and conversation and is staffed by the friendliest workers. Hakima, Tyler and Nessa were awesome and made you feel welcome. The lounge offers Happy Hour with great deals on drinks.\nI highly recommend staying at the Distrikt Hotel if you find yourself in NYC. It's located close to Times Square, The Theatre district and a few blocks from Penn Station. Excellent value for NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:26:39.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
