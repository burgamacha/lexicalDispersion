Within walking distance of Gard de Nord although did not feel particularly comfortable walking through the outer district. Not too far to historic area of Paris and walked to many places from hotel. The room was quite small. We couldn't open the wardrobe door as it hit the bottom of the bed so didn't use it. Also the chair was more a stool. The picture of the room on advertising was not representative of our room although the furnishings were nice and the windows cancelled out the street noise. All in all I would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:39:57.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
