The reception staff are very well trained and friendly (Aurelia was lovely, and noticed we were returning guests). We had an 8th floor Superior room and it was great - very quiet. It's a 6 minute walk to Hammersmith Tube and lots of restaurants nearby. The bar was great for snacks and pre-dinner drinks. The breakfast was also great even though it was busy, the staff coped well. I wish all hotels trained their staff so well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:55:03.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
