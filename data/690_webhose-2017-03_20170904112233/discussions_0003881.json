Lots of photo opportunities in the hotel and the proximity to the subway is definitely a plus. Of special mention would be the wonderful service team and I had received a fair amount of assistance from Natasha. She had helped me to locate a nearby garage, sorted out directions for my visit to the Statue of Liberty. Definitely two thumbs up and I would strongly recommend TPF for visitors who aren't looking for a run of the mill place to stay over. I had definitely enjoyed my stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:26:51.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
