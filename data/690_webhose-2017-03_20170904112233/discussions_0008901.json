I stayed here for 6 nights and can therefore offer an informed opinion. this is one of the best an most reasonably priced hotels in the centre of the city. Very handy for the tube and close to the V & A Museum. The hotel itself is supper clean and well appointed. The rooms are a good size and the beds are comfortable. The concierge service was second to none, the kind of service you would expect at much, much more expensive hotel. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel , services and staff. The breakfast was excellent and there was even free bubbly in the bar in the evening.\nHighly recommended.\nRoom Tip: Friends and I stayed on the 44th floor.
