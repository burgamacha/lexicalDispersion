Regardless, the price was a little on the higher end for what I'd typically pay.\nOverall, it was a positive experience. The room was clean with modern embellishments in what would be otherwise plain accommodations. I slept pretty well and didn't experience any interruptions.\nThe restaurant in the hotel was overpriced, especially considering the quality of the food. Although I will note that the food catered for the conference was pretty good.\nI wish I would've made it to the swimming pool, as it looked inviting. There were a lot of nooks and spots in the lobby area for people to hang out during breaks.\nOverall, a nice and well-kept property with a friendly staff. Nothing extraordinary, just a solid place that suited my needs and did a good job hosting the conference.\nAside from the nearby highway, the scenery around the hotel is beautiful. It is within walking distance from an In-N-Out Burger and a couple convenience stores -- although the store I wandered into late one night seemed a bit sketchy.\nIt is also quite handily located close to a BART station, so if you want to catch a train to downtown San Francisco, it's a little bit of a stroll to get there, but completely worth it. No need for a vehicle, which is a huge plus!\nRoom Tip: The higher the floor, the better See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:44:02.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
