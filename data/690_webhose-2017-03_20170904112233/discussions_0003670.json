Really close to the Eiffel Tower and two good train lines. Franprix (supermarket) a few doors down and souvenir shops and restaurants close by. Comfortable basic rooms. Free wifi. Breakfast was basic and a bit pricey for the offerings but there are other options very close by. The last guest had locked the safe shut so couldn't use it but the fridge was handy and bathroom was a nice size. Could smell smoke when people were smoking in the courtyard outside the room but it was not often that this happened and we weren't in the hotel for long periods apart from sleeping. All the staff were really friendly and multi-lingual.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:26:10.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
