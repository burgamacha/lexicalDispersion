However, it is not very loud and is a reasonable walk to Kensington Gardens. Room had no dresser and very small closet. Gave 2 free waters per day, a nice added benefit.

Considering the reasonable price of the hotel, I would definitely recommend.\nRoom Tip: Rooms overlooking garden are quieter See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:59:30.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
