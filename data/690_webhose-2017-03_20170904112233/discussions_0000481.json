The location is convenient, the hotel itself is homey, not too big, and the staff were superb. It seems that they all recognized us and knew who we were from the time we checked in. We returned to the hotel after a few days in Italy, and they greeted us as old friends. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.\nI highly recommend this as a place to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:50:06.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
