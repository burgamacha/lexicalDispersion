It's a beautiful hotel and the staff are so welcoming and helpful. Our bedroom was airy, spacious and beautifully designed and breakfast was delicious. The attention to detail and little touches (Honesty Bar, free soft-drinks in the mini-bar) made us feel very welcome and we would have no hesitation in recommending it or staying here again.
