Basic room is fine, although a little small with no drawers to store belongings in. Public rooms are well appointed and the breakfast is fine with lots of variety. They forgot to make up our room after the first night and the room was very warm during the night, (no way to control that and opening the window let a lot of noise in). This is the only reason I am giving it 4 puff and not 5.\nBest thing is that the staff is superb- very helpful and cheerful.\nWill return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:42:48.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
