The staff were all courteous, the rooms, bathrooms (especially) were spotless. We booked a pickup and drop off from the concierge at the hotel. For a premium charge we wanted you avoid the hassle of trying to secure a ride blindly from the airport, we heard the scam stories from taxis and limo services. It was worth it, the hotel staff had an airport personnel escort us from the time we left the plane, through securing visa, and to our car, a fairly decent Audi. The concierge staff even upgraded our drop off to a Jaguar, nice touch. Hotel is a short 5 min walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. Overall, this hotel with it's staff is first-rate and is highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:21:09.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
