It is in a quiet side street, yet an easy walk to restaurants, a taxi queue, and shops. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Rooms are accessible by elevator, clean, and well-appointed for a reasonable priced hotel. The continental breakfast is a good value, with fresh food, good seating, and variety of choices. I felt secure and safe staying here and plan to return on future visits.\nRoom Tip: As far as I can tell, every room is good for solo travelers.
