We booked a Chambers Junior Suite and it was worth every penny. The whole hotel is very grand, beautiful giant windows the room really added to the experience. The marble bathroom was lovely and bed was very comfortable. We requested a suite overlooking the station as our son loves trains. Very glad we did. As we had a suite we had access to a private part of the hotel where our room was. They also served breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner canap√©s in the private common room. The staff were always very friendly and loved chatting with our son, making us feel very welcomed. Getting to the Eurostar with all of our luggage could not have been easier. There is an entrance via the restaurant. Overall we would definitely recommend a stay here. It is well worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:44:51.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
