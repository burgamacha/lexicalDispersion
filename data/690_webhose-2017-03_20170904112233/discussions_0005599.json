Every staff member was very helpful and nice, especially Tej who helped with the breakfast area. The room was simple, but clean and came with everything needed (and had a great view). The location was great and no more than a 2 minute walk to the Rome metro station. It was a bit farther from the center of Paris, but the metro is so easy to use that it didn't matter to us. Overall a good place to stay with a good price!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:16:30.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
