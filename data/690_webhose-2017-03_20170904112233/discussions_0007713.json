The en-suite was beautifully done, with a good-size shower and a very good range of toiletries. Some guests might find the absence of double-glazing a problem but actually Queen's Gate is not too busy a street at night and even my light-sleeping husband was happy.\nWork is still being done to upgrade the Gore and there are improvements still to be made, not least the replacement of some rather threadbare stair-carpets at the upper levels and the provision of in-room kettles with flexes long enough to reach the plugs and still stand safely level! But in my book character counts for a lot, and there is plenty of that at the Gore.\nWe ate an evening meal and breakfast in Bar 190 and were more than happy with both - and as many reviewers have said, the service is charming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:32:51.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
