The bar/breakfast area is almost immediately at the entrance, which can be a bit disconcerting, but if you sit toward the back of the area it's fine. There are only a few newspapers available each day, so if you're looking for a specific paper you may be out of luck. There are some good restaurants are toward the south-east, across the street.\nUpon check-in a room upgrade was pushed (under the guise of it being the only way to get a room before 3pm), but it wasn't something I'd normally upgrade to at that price point. The room had a built-in step to a higher area with the windows, which wasn't flagged or noted in anyway, which meant I tripped at night when going to the windows. This should be flagged for guests to avoid injury and liability.\nThis is a Hilton property, so you can collect HHonours points, and happily have your perks in the program provided. The staff are generally helpful and friendly.\nWalking in late at night can be a bit dodgy because of the location, so be alert. There are always staff at the front desk, so there is that bit of added security. Also note that Ubers and some taxis have difficult locating the hotel's entrance, so be prepared to call the Uber driver to advise where you want to meet up.\nRoom Tip: Trafalgar Square-side has traffic noise. For quiet, get the other side of the hotel. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:27:44.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
