We picked the hotel based on location. It was walking distance from Penn Station, Town Hall, Times Square, and a quick trip to Central Park. We were upgraded on arrival to a one-bedroom suite. It had a king bed and a sofa bed in the living room. Kind of disappointing that there was only one bathroom. The staff was prompt to our requests to get linen for the sofa bed and a problem we were having with the shower. We did not have anything to eat or drink at the hotel so I canâ€™t comment on the quality or the cost of food/liquor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:18:17.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
