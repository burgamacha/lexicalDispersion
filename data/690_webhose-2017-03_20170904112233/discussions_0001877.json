Next door is a typical French bakery! However this is very expensive we thought. The hotel staff are all very friendly and professional. Especially Judith on reception making our check in very easy. She also tried her best getting a room earlier than the check in time because we was very tired from traveling. She upgraded our room to the 6th floor and also had a bottle of champagne waiting for us which was a very nice touch. I would suggest arranging the hotel to arrange there private Chauffer service before hand has they have someone waiting at arrivals for you and they take you straight to the hotel which is very convenient. Didn't try the breakfast at €18 a pop much rather walk round the corner to a main road and get a croissant for €1 on there! 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower which is also a great thing. Also recommend hiring bikes next to the hotel and go cycle round Paris at that is very! We will definitely be back at this amazing hotel.
