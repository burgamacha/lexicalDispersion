Its a fabulous old hotel that is looking a little tired but that is one of its few detractions. The staff and management are excellent. Dealing with issues, problems for people with storm concerns, they do it with good grace and understanding. One employee Evelyn, never seemed to leave the place. The waiters at breakfast were delightful! Nothing was a problem, they were cheery, respectful and enjoyable. Did such a great job, it made you look forward to breakfast. The view across Central Park was lovely. Sam, Francesco, Efra and others were so friendly. Great service all round and at a reasonable price. And check out is noon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:17:05.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
