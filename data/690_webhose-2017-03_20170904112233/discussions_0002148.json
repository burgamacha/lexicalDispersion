It has the kind of neighborhood feel you are looking for in Greenwich Village. The lobby is charming with a fireplace and overstuffed furniture. It is an easy nine block walk to Washington Square, so it is a great place to stay if visiting NYU. You are right next to the Parson's school. You are 1 block from the 123 subway station on 14th making it a snap to get to Times Square. Union Square is only 3 blocks away. Lots of restaurants all around. The staff is fantastic and willing to go out of their way to make it a great stay. A special shout out to Mike and his crew. Definitely plan to come back\nGreen Features: Excellent. Water Saving toilets and ability to keep towels", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:48:22.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
