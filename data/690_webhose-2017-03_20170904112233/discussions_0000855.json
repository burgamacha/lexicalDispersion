The hotel is delightful--comfortable, well decorated, thoughtfully designed rooms, lovely bathroom--with a window overlooking the Arene de Lutece (!)-- and a very very good breakfast. But it is the staff that makes this hotel--they are extremely pleasant and accommodating. Special thanks to Lucie, Cristina, and Sans (the night receptionist)for all of their help with reservations and answering questions. WE WILL BE BACK SOON!!!!\nRoom Tip: We had the smallest, least expensive room and it was delightful.
