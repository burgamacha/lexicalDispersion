It works, but I could not imagine having it switched on during the night (at least not without earplugs). Staff is good, not all smiles, but very efficient. Late checkout was arranged in less than a minute. Location in Midtown is great! I would stay here again, although the aircon needs work.\nRoom Tip: My room was on the 6th floor, 49th street and that was quite noisy (did not bother me though) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:29:49.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
