Breakfast was basic but for us it was enough.The staff was very, very friendly and very helpfull. We asked the direction to a place and they looked how we had to get there and printed off the route. The hotel is ideal for people who already saw the highlights of Paris. The Montmartre region is cosier than the busy center places. Altough it is in the sexshop area it gave no problems.\nWe stayed for two nights and ordered a privelige room. We were a bit disappointed by the room because it was on the backside and in the roof. The only view we had were the rooftops of the surrounding buildings. As it was in the roof the walls weren't straight so I bumped my head a few times.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:04:16.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
