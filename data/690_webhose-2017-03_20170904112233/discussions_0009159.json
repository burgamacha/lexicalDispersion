It had a very comfortable bed, good storage facilities with a room safe, space to rest and sit, and a lovely bathroom with a walk in shower. Itâ€™s well located for exploring Manhattan, being one street away from the Empire State building. The rooftop bar is expensive but provided a great view of the Empire State building. There is a nice ground floor bar restaurant that can provide meals, but we did not make use of the restaurant. Waiting time for lift were bit slow as there are only two lifts. When we there, Marriot were using this hotel to sell and promote their Vacation Club Resorts. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and free Wi-Fi worked well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:34:05.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
