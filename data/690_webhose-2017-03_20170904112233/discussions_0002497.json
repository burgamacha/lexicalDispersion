I travel to Paris on a regular basis for work and have stayed at various hotels at all levels of the spectrum, from 3 star to 5 star and this hotel is by far my favourite. The location is perfect, the rooms are large (especially for Paris standards) and are very well maintained. The bathroom was an absolute delight, especially the shower which can’t be said for all hotels in Paris. In addition to this, the staff were exceptional. They were extremely friendly from the time arrived to the time I left and left no request unturned. They went above and beyond to ensure that my entire stay ran smoothly and were extremely accommodating. You couldn’t ask for nicer hotel staff & they are very well versed in English.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:54:39.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
