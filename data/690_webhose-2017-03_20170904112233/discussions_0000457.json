Hotel is intimate with a classic modern design, great location for reaching a lot of key attractions of the city, comfortable beds and bathrooms with all the amenities, rooms just a bit smaller than we're used to but wasn't too big a factor. Breakfast was amazing and quite filling, sometimes allowing us to skip lunch to spend more time exploring Paris. But amongst all the great things about this hotel, the one factor that differentiates itself for similar business is its service and hospitality. By far one of the best staff duo's in Julien and Pierre. Anticipated our every need and treated us like VIP on our honeymoon. Thank you to both of you for just being amazing. Would definitely recommend and stay here next time! Book fast and early though...they only have 19 rooms!\nRoom Tip: Spend a little more and go for the Superior room class!
