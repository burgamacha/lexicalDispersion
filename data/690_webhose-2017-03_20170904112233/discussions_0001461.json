Close to the subway. . It was a while ago when we stayed there. September 2015. It did not give me the option in the date area. I can tell you that it is a wonderful place to stay. The rooms are great and the service is outstanding. We were taken care of by Renza and Nikki. I promised them I would review the hotel and them. I just waited too long to do it. Better late than never. The breakfast area was great and the food exceptional. The price of the rooms were the best you will find anywhere in New York.
