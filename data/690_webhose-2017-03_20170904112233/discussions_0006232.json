We arrived at 1pm and our room was 10 mins from being ready. They offered us a seat in the bar and gave us complimentary drinks.\nReception staff happy to give you recommendations on places to visit (with a map) and places to eat. I have reviewed a number of restaurants separately.\nThe hotel is a few minutes walk from the Roman Forum and only about 10 minutes to the Colliseum. The area is very \"historical\" and a nice place to wander.\nTaxis are very plentiful in Rome and reasonably priced (10 euros to Vatican). Tips are also not expected by taxi drivers.\nRooms in hotel are smart ours had a shower (with toiletries) and a very comfortable bed. The TV was cleverly disguised as a mirror (I heard other guests say they couldn't find the TV!)\nBreakfast was not included but a good selection of continental breakfasts were available for 10 euros or less. The bar area was also very clean. the bar itself opens until 1pm. We had 2 drinks last night (G&T plus a disserano and coke at about midnight last night cost for both a reasonable 12 euros).\nTrue the are livelier places in Rome to stay but for me Nerva was perfect at a reasonable cost (480 euros for 3 nights including discount for paying in cash).\nDon't often give 5 stars for hotels but this rating is thoroughly deserved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:11:40.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
