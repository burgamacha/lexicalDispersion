From the moment we booked we were looked after like royalty. We were contacted by their concierge to see if there was anything they could help us with.\nOn arrival, as usual, a swift and effortless check in. Our room was on a high floor with an iconic view of London.\nA wonderful surprise treat awaited us in our room.\nImmediately down to blind spot for a wonderful cocktail.\nBreakfast as usual was wonderful and a hearty start to the day.\nI would love to commend one exceptional member of staff, but they were all fantastic.\nWe chose St Martins Lane as we were only in the capital for two days and its location for the west end and theatre district is second to none.\nWe are back in May and its a tough choice between here and the sister hotel The Sanderson.\nEither way, both are highly recommended.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:21:07.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
