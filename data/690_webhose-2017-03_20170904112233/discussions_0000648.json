(As I have been 5x in London, I had never such a \"spacefull\" room as in this hotel, because normally rooms in London are tiny and tight)\nPlus, the Hotel is perfectly located if you want to avoid the underground.\nAs the piccadilly circus is just 2 Minutes of walk, from there you can join the shopping streets as the oxford street, carnaby street and so on in only maximum 10 minutes of walk.\nThe Hotel is also located near leicester square, where you can join the covent garden in a 5 minutes walk.\nThe Big Ben and London eye are a 15 minutes walk away, such as the palace of westminster.\nYou can also find a lot of theaters, musicals and some bars and lovely restaurants in this area.\nI really recommend this Hotel if you want to enjoy a comfortable, relaxfull stay where you can feel like home, and which is near everything you need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:00:24.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
