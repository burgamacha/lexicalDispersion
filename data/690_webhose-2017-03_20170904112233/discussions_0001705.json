We arrived earlier than check in time and they had our room ready which is very handy so we didn't need to walk with the bags.\nThe Hotel is very clean, they always provide you with clean towels and sheets.\nThe rooms are the typical Italian style, the lift is quite small but is enough for two people.\nThe staff is very friendly, on arrival they prompted us with a city map with the most important attractions, and they also have tickets for Vatican etc.\nThe Hotel has free wifi and they provide you with a password on arrival.\nThe Hotel is very well located, 10 min to the termini station and 15min walking to the colosseum.\nThere is plenty of restaurants and bars around so you don't need to walk to much for a good meal.\nWe had breakfast included, the staff is very kind and there is a variety of lovely croissants, fresh bread, juice, cereals etc. You also have a store just beside the Hotel if you need tou buy anything else.\nI really recommend this Hotel, Just very close to the centre and with good price.\nJust be prepared that at checkout they will ask for 4â‚¬ per person/day for the city taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:23:19.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
