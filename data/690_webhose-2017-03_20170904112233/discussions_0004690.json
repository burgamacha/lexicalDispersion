However they had arranged for us to stay just around the corner for one night at no cost and refunded one nights room cost. With complimentary drinks in the bar until the room was ready the situation was very well handled. Once settled in our correct room, we found everything clean and tidy. The hotels food options are very limited, but as you are right in the heart on NYC that's no problem and allowed us to sample breakfast, lunch and dinner in nearby venues. The central location means this is a good hotel for exploring NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:55:31.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
