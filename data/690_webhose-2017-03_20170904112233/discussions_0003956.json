Or the subway station is a 5 minute walk, maximum.\nThe hotel itself isn't the newest or the smartest, but it's very cheap and clean.\nFor the price it is an amazing hotel.\nThe staff were all so friendly and helpful. We had lots of questions as tourist do!!! And the staff were always more than happy to help.\nThere was one guy on reception called pranay who was amazing.\nWe asked him if he knew of any local restaurants away from the tourist parts , the next thing we knew he had printed 3 pages off of all good local restaurants. We visited 3 of them and they were great. ( a little advice if you go there, head towards 9th avenue for a lot better, choice, price and quality food)\nThe breakfast at the hotel is just what you need to set yourself up for the day , light but filling. There is always coffee, tea, water etc available at reception to take away or drink there , and cookies in the afternoon.\nThere's only one \"bad\" thing at the hotel and that's nothing to do with hotel. But expect a lot of noise 24 hours a day. Police, fire engines, taxi etc.... all day long. But it's central New York so that goes without saying really.\nI would totally recommend this hotel for anyone going sightseeing. Great and cheap and central for everything. And don't forget the great staff.\nThanks for making our trip amazing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:39:18.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
