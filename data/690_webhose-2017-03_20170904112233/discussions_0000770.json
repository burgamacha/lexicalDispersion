This worked out great for us. They had our rooms right next to each other. The beds were very comfortable. Usually I have problems sleeping with a hotels pillows but these were great. I do recommend requesting a room on the courtyard side. My kids had the street and they thought it was noisy. Didn't stop the teens from sleeping, but if you are sensitive, it may stop you.\nHaving teens, I love a free breakfast on vacation. They can really put the croissants down. This was a great feature. Plus they will make you American Coffee. I need a lot of coffee before hitting the Louvre.\nThe staff was extremely friendly. They made us feel welcomed and they spoke great English. Much better than my French. They also told us where to avoid with the teens so they wouldn't see risque sights. That was advice I appreciated.\nRoom Tip: ask for courtyard not street facing See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:35:46.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
