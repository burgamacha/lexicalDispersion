I was told they had a special so there was no charge for the parking . My reservation email did not say that. I called the next morning to confirm and was told the same thing. I was also told by the manager that it showed up on the computer screen but he could not get it to me. Luckily I had spoken to someone else who had given me the email to the manager so I wrote and confirmed what he had said.\nWhen I arrived I was told by the same manager that I had to pay for the parking. I had misunderstood, the special was on the room. He did say I could cancel my reservation. That was not possible as I had a plane to catch. On my return I stayed the night. Room was newly remodeled; reading lamps on the bed did not work, lights in the bathroom did not work, the elevator did not work in the morning( I thought nothing of that till I read other reviews and it appears the elevator does not work quite often.) Breakfast was marginal. No one came to replenish or clean up. Out of milk and watered down waffle mix.\nI paid and left. Called Days Inn. They were very helpful. What helped me was the email I had sent confirming our conversation. I was reimbursed the parking charges. Read a review where they did a similar thing to another person.\nRoom Tip: Stay away or confirm everything in writing email or fax.
