We could not recommend it more. To start it was situated in the lovely Montmartre area and 2 mins walk from the metro Guy Moquet.\nThe hotel staff were absolutely lovely and went over and above to make our stay comfortable and welcoming. They also asked every morning if we were ok needed directions or any help. They even helped me print out my confirmation tickets for our dinner boat cruise which I would highly recommend.\nThere are 5 floors of the hotel each accessed by a beautiful spiral staircase. There is a lift however if you have cases.\nThe room was absolutely spotless, pristine in fact and could not be faulted. As Parisian rooms go they are a bit on the small side but that's Paris so need to embrace it. Big enough for the two of us for three nights.\nBeds were so comfortable and the shower was great. Fresh towels were provided every morning if required.\nThe hotel does sit on quite a busy side street, however we found this is only busy at rush hour and nice and quiet by night time. We fortunately had a room (45) that faced onto the courtyard at the back of the hotel.\nWe didn't have breakfast at the hotel therefore cannot comment however we treated ourselves to a delicious pastry breakfast at the boulangery at the end of the street. The best pain au chocolate we have ever had.\nAll in all would definitely stay here again and recommend!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:08:39.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
