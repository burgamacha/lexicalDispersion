Never been to Rome before so with it being close to the Roma Terminal it was great for us to get about easily and to and from the airport. Upon arrival we were told our room had been upgraded which was a nice surprise. The staff were all really friendly, helpful and welcoming. Breakfast was nice, lots of options to choose from. They hosted a gig on one of the nights as well which was a nice touch, the bar itself is incredible as it has beautiful views, nice drinks and lovely staff. We also received free cheesecake on one of the nights (just because they could!) I'm usually a very picky person and I couldn't fault it one bit, will definitely be coming back and have recommended to my family.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:59:05.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
