I spent 2 days in the standard executive room and was once again a great stay. The hotel is in the best location in the city as its close to the business districts and entertainment areas. The staff is excellent and the breakfast buffet is the best in the city. I also spent time enjoying the tea garden area on the 6th floor which is the place I go to relax now after a day of meetings. I look forward to staying there again on my next visit!\nRoom Tip: the best rooms are on the higher levels for a good view of the city See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:58:27.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
