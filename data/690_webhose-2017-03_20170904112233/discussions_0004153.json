We had 5 nights and were completely satisfied. Our room had a view of the Empire State Building and everything was on our doorstep - Times Square was only 10 minutes walk away.\nTip: Go to Korea Town (1 block over) for dinner - good value and great variety. Restaurant in the hotel was pricey and had limited availability so that's where we went. Twice!\nService was impeccable, room was large (for NYC!) and the free coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoon very welcome. We were room only so I popped over to Gregory's for coffee, tea muffins and scones to eat in the room whilst enjoying the great view.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a Empire State view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:44:35.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
