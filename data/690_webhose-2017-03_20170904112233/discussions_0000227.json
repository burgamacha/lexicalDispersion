Great staff, very clean rooms. Rooms looked recently remodeled/updated. Overall I was very satisfied with the room quality. Hotel gym had good equipment as well, good mix of cardio, weights, etc. The only complaint I have is with the bar/restaurant downstairs. I had a meal at the bar that night. The wines were good -- good selection, though a bit on the pricey side. The food was sub-par. I ordered a soup which tasted like clam chowder from a can with some garnish on top. I would come here again if they improved the food at the restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:15:22.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
