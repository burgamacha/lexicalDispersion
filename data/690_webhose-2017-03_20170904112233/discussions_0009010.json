It was our first time in this area of London and also at this hotel and we were left with one of the best memories of our trip.\nThe hotel is well located in the heart of kensington, there are lovely shops and restaurants on the side and a few minutes walk too, going to caffe nero and and vini italiani wine shop. we had lovely view by queensgate street and the room was very well designed from the mirror to tiled bathroom.\nWe loved sitting in lounging area and read newspapers provided by the hotel, or just relax at the cocktail bar, James is an excellent bartender and looked after us very well. The service was fantastic with smiles and professionalism all round, special mentions to George - a charismatic staff and others who looked after us.\nWe will be staying here again next year as we had a pleasant and enjoyable stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:23:57.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
