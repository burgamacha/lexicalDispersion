Dropped our bags off before check in, brilliant room quiet and comfy able to adjust the temp in the room. Couldn't wait for breakfast every day! Such good value for money and location was spot on being across the road from Euston and one or two streets from st Pancras station.\nCant wait to check back in. I've stayed here before a few years ago and booked as I knew it was a fail safe hotel but definitely exceeded my expectations this time. Really nice decor in the restaurant. We ate there on our last night, steak and burger were fab... didn't expect nice food from premier inn but this was as good as a grill type restaurant! Couldn't fault our stay, can't wait to visit again !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:41:59.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
