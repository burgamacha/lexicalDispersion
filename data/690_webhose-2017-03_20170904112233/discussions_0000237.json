The location is perfect, not only its position in the square but also how close everything is. I walked everywhere from here, l didn't catch a train, bus or taxi I just walked. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, lots of variety over my six night stay. I enjoyed my coffee outside watching the square wake up and in the evening a glass of wine watching the sun go down.
