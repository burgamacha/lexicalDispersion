Times Square is also within walking distance but it is a fair old trot but worth it if only to absorb the atmosphere of NYC itself. The room itself wasn't particularly big but it was all that was needed. A clean bed, clean bathroom and WARM! The staff were always on hand to help with any questions or queries and the breakfast was good enough to kick start your day, although the later you go down the busier it is, and the breakfast room isn't very big, although with plenty of places to eat this wasn't really a negative more an observation as we managed to get seated and eat plenty even if we had a short wait.\nThere were 2 lifts operating within the hotel and the view from our particular room was amazing with the top of the Empire State Building being just over our shoulders and directly out of the window.\nWe had a late flight home and our luggage was looked after whilst we ventured out for the remainder of the time we had left. The housekeeper always looked after anything we left in our rooms well putting it neatly down if it was on the bed. I couldn't find fault with the hotel and if it wasn't so expensive to return when I'm hoping to I would have booked again without hesitation!\nThere's water, tea and coffee available 24 hours and the main hotel lounge was lovely and warm to be.\nA lovely little gem! Thanks for the lovely time!\nRoom Tip: great views, walking distance to many places including Times Square.
