The room was very spacious and clean. They put a lot of attention to every little detail to make the room comfortable and accommodating. Although the hotel doesn't have an elevator, the staff there helped us with our luggage to our room and when we checked out. They also provide complimentary bottled water in the lobby. Would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:03:03.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
