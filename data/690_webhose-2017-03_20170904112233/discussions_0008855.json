From checking in to out, the staff very helpful and courteous.\nHad lunch again in their restaurant Scoff & Banter, great quality and good selection of wines as well. Might even try their afternoon tea next time, as it did look good.\nGreat room again overlooking the square, very spacious and clean. If you're looking for that little bit more with your stay, I would recommend the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:16:55.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
