It's a funny place but we are used to travelling in the US in chain hotels that are bland and all the same. This place is a one-off. Yes the rooms are small but you only need somewhere to kick off your shoes at the end of a day sightseeing. It's intimate and there's a good choice at breakfast. They left a treat in our room on my husband's birthday and were so helpful with ordering taxi's, recommending restaurant's etc. We picked it so we could walk to the Vatican, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon etc and we did. We didn't need to take the train/bus anywhere. Moments walk from the Spanish Steps and lots of restaurants. Would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:19:24.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
