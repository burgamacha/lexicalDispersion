The hotel rooms are a bit dated but they were big, clean and the location of this property is fabulous. You are a few minutes walk from Grand Central Station. There are shops and restaurants all around you and you are only 10-15 minutes from Times Square. We found this hotel to be very quiet even though there was a lively bar on the ground floor.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 10th floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:01:11.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
