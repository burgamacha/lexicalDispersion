My office is just a couple of blocks north of the hotel so the location is perfect for me. It's also just a few minutes from the Canal stations for the blue, yellow, and green lines.\nThe rooms are pretty standard for NYC - nothing to write home about but certainly comfortable enough for a week long stay. The staff are friendly and remember you throughout your trip. I am a Starwood member so I usually opt for the high floors on the club levels. This is great as it includes afternoon happy hour in the clubroom as well as free breakfasts. The bfasts are above average for hotels in my opinion - just enough to get you through to lunch.\nThe only downside of this hotel is its right on Canal St so definitely opt for a room facing away from canal. You won't get the nice Empire State Building view, but at least you won't be hearing nonstop honking when there's traffic.\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing south are quieter.
