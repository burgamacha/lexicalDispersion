Out of the Metro Station, you get to walk about ten to fifteen minutes to get to the entrance of this hotel.\nThe district is a bit 'rotten' with closed down shops and graffiti, and some people loitering on some abandoned 'tunnels' or 'footpaths'. It is a rather quiet district otherwise, and a bit too quiet when you come back at night.\nWith that room rate we got and the comparatively spacious and well-equipped rooms you get within Paris region, I think there is nothing to complain about.\nOne thing is, hope it has been improved since my stay, that when I stayed there, free Internet access was only provided in public areas of the Hotel. You can imagine some guests sitting in the lobby at night to stay connected with their friends and family, or, with the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:53:46.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
