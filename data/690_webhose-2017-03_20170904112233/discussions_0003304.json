Excellent location - near to family we were visiting, but also very convenient for central Paris, via the metro - and only a few stops from Gare du Nord for Eurostar. The area is very lively, with plenty of bars and cafes close by. We expected to be kept awake at night, but actually the hotel is set further up a side road from Place de Clichy - and with the shutters closed on third floor, there was no disturbance at all.\nThe hotel is plain and simple in its exterior and reception area, reflecting perhaps its two stars, but the room was freshly painted, beds freshly laundered, bathroom new and spotlessly clean. The TV and Wifi were fine, but above all the staff were very friendly and welcoming - as reflected in the other reviews.\nMy daughter managed to depart, leaving her mobile phone charging in the wall at the hotel, and only realised this fact on arrival back in London! However, the manager of the hotel was very obliging and helpful and soon enough the phone had been retrieved by my niece, who lives nearby.\nFull marks - this hotel is very good value for money, very clean and with nice staff. We will stay here again! Thankyou!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:51:53.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
