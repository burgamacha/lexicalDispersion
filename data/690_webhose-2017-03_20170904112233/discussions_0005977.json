The staff is always kind and extremeley helpful (not a given in Paris...), and they always go the extra mile in order to help. The rooms sre quiet and spacious, with all sorts of plugs so you don't need an adaptor! Wifi is powerful all across the building. The food is great and the bar service is impeccable. Also much better prices compared to other 5 stars hotels in Paris which absolutely offer a worse service.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:22:26.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
