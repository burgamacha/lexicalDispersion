My husband decided to come along as well. When we entered the lobby we felt like we were transported back in time. I definitely didn't feel hip enough to hang out in the lounge - but it was super cool and a throwback to another time for sure. I especially loved the hanging keys behind the check in counter on incredibly heavy key fobs that I had to remove from the key so I didn't have to carry it around in my purse all day! We took the elevator up to our room and it was the only time we took the elevator as it was super slow but an experience! I actually loved the central stairwell after that - it has more character than any stairwell I have ever seen. If only those walls could talk - the history in this place is probably unbelievable. Our room was super cute! Very small as should be expected, but everything you could need was finely appointed and had a place. I would definitely recommend the Marlton. Great location for my work, and was also close to a subway so I could squeeze in some sightseeing as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:54:06.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
