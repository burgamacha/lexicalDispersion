With all the rush and noise of a megapolis the hotel stands on a very quiet street, which everyone passes by, so inside the room it's very calm. I had a wonderful stay there. With breakfasts a la carte I felt no rush in the morning, the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming. One day when the electricity was off for couple of hours, all the stuff was very helpful. Rooms are decorated in a classic style, very cozy. The only disappointment was the quality of wifi in the room. I had to work from the business center. But again, the stuff was very thoughtful and delivered breakfast there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:38:28.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
