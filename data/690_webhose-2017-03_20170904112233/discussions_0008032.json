The location is fantastic and is perfectly situated. Can walk to so many attractions. Having kitchen amenities available meant we could eat breakfast, prepare a lunch to eat while out and about, and cook dinner in the evening. Traveled with 2 children (10 and 7), the pullout sofa was perfect for them. Nice private room for us to sleep in and a nice big comfy bed. Nice staff, clean facility, great location and a nice room with plenty of space. We will be staying there again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:18:08.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
