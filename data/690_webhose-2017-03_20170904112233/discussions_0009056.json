It is within a five minute walk of two underground stations on two different lines as well as loads of places to eat and shop. You can get fast food or pub fare, sushi or burgers or falafel. Yet, the Studios itself is not on a busy street and is nice and quiet in the evening when you want to sleep.\nThe place is a little worn and a bit quirky, with a lovely garden out back, so it felt very homey. There's no lift, so request a room on the ground or first floor if you're not a good stair climber. The rooms are a little small by American standards, but have their own bath, dining area and kitchenette (which we really appreciated. You can save yourself money by stocking up at one of the markets on nearby Queensway and cooking in a few meals.)\nThere's someone on duty at the desk 24 hours a day, which was nice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:38:20.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
