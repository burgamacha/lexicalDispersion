The bathroom and shower were spotless and modern, as well. The staff was professional, multi-lingual, accommodating, kind, and attentive. The dining services are also superior and I had some of the best Chianti of my trip in this hotel. The pictures that are on-line are actually representative of this hotel. The breakfast was amazing; such a variety! The Wifi does work and there is in-room coffee maker and the mini-bar is few for the \"first time.\"\nRoom Tip: Ask for room closer to the roof-top deck, quieter.
