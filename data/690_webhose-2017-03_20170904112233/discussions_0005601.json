The location was great (walk out the door to the Pantheon), and the staff were wonderful (Mauro, Alessandra, & Paulo). Our room was spacious, very beautifully furnished. The ceiling made you feel like you were sleeping in the Sistine Chapel. They were very clean along with the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was great with a good selection for everybody. The view from the Terrace Bar Roof Garden was magnificent. It is within walking distance to many attractions, (The Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Colosseum) and a short cab to the Vatican City for tours. Mauro reserved our tour, I highly recommend it. Our wifi worked great within the hotel and our room. Should I return to Rome in the future, I wouldn't think twice about returning to the Albergo del Senato. Grazie Mille to all the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:14:22.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
