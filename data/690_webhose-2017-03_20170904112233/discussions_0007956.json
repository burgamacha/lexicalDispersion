Everything about this afternoon tea made us smile! My sister had just had an operation a few days before so was struggling to walk and the staff were so helpful and accommodating, helping her walk to her seat so we were really pleased right from the start.\nAs for the afternoon tea itself, the actual seating area is quite small but it gave it a nice feeling. It's nicely got little beauty and the beast props around like cogsworth. The food itself was really excellent, staff were excellent! We were really pleased with everything and just loved the experience. Definitely so worth the visit! The staff offered to take photos of you with the props and the afternoon tea as it was all themed!\nThe sweet selection was actually amazing! All themed after beauty and the beast and everyone was given the option to take things home if you couldn't finish which we thought was good. We loved how they incorporated items like Mrs Potts to pour cream on to the jelly, and serving a mousse from inside the chip cup!\nA lot of friends are really jealous that we've been but we've highly recommended to everyone and I would so love to go back! Definitely the best afternoon tea we've been to so far.. and weve been to a lot!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:54:33.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
