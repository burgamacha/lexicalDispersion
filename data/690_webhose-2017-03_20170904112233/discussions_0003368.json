We had initially thought about a sightseeing bus to get around but we soon realised everything was within walking distance. The furthest away being the Coliseum- 45 min walk. We chose a Deluxe room and that was lovely but small- wouldn't have liked the standard ones for size. It was well equipped with mini bar, kettle, hair drier, iron, gowns and slippers. Breakfast was lovely and staff very helpful. Highly recommend!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:30:37.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
