We found the Paper Factory Hotel on TripAdvisor and Booking.com and decided to go for it. This hotel turned out to be great.\nPro: location - just walk out the door and you are right at the entrance to the M and R trains\nCleanliness - no issues here, pretty clean\nHeat/AC - our room had good working heat and air. Good because it was frigid outside and we couldn't event tell.\nCon: not really any to mention\nI loved the modern style mixed with the retro lobby. Best part of our stay was the location of the subway. We were able to walk right on to the trains most of the timr.\nThis hotel looks like it is going through upgrades/renovations/finishing touches so workers were all over the place. Guess it's good that they keep up on the wear and tear.\nI would totally recommend things hotel to anyone. On fact I already have, on the plane ride back home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:27:27.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
