We no way expected to be allowed to check into our room at 1:30, but the girl at the front desk was so accommodating... Smiled and said of course! The room we knew would be small but really we didn't need much room with only 2 of us. King bed was somewhat comfy (nothing beats Hampton inn beds thougH)... Coffee maker in room with premium coffee was delicious. Newly decorated, modern. Excellent lighting (am a stickler for that) and dreamy shower... Tons of hot hot water. If you can ask for higher floor . We were on 5th and noisy street especially on trash day. But the hotel even provided ear plugs and that did the trick. The lobby is small but free coffee, tea and water provided. Even a small bar in the back with nightly happy hour. Free breakfast is basic but hot. The real thing going for this hotel is the staff. They smile and look you in the eye and seem to genuinely like each other and their jobs. And that translates into an exceptional experience for everyone! Thanks we'll be back. Walk to Andrews coffee shop if want good diner breakfast that won't break the bank.. $7 bucks eggs and bacon . Oh and they will keep your luggage for you after check out no charge!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:53:19.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
