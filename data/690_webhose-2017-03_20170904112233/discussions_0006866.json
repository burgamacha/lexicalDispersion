From the moment we arrived, Julie was super friendly and helpful. Every morning, the staff greeted us with smiles. Clara is wonderful at the reception desk, giving helpful information when we wanted to use the Metro or needed her to call us a taxi. The breakfast offers a huge selection and Laurent was always happy to serve. The rooms are beautiful and clean, roomy and comfortable. It's located near the Champs Elysees and several Metro stations so it's very easy to get around. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would have no problem staying here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:39:49.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
