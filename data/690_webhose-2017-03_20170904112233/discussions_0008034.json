The hotel itself is quite small built into the former property of the Vanderbilt family. Check-in I did online in advance where I was allowed to pre-select my room. This meant that my room key was waiting for me at the concierge - very smooth and efficient. Check-out was similarly efficient. The standard double room was small but cosy and the temperature and noise levels perfect which meant I had one of the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel. The breakfast in the morning was buffet style, which is not ideal as some of the hot items clearly needed some refreshing - that said there was a good selection including freshly squeezed juices. For fans of the rock band Queen, the hotel is a short distance from the former home of Freddie Mercury - Garden Lodge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:39:48.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
