The wonderful staff contacted me and said they would keep a room if they had a cancelation.\nI can't speak highly enough of the beautiful lady on reception, she was full of advice and could answer all my questions.\nThe hotel is immaculately clean, the rooms are small but perfect for the solo traveller and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is modern and the shower is hot.\nThis hotel delivers everything I required with a friendly welcoming professionalism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:54:25.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
