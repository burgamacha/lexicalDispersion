Hotel has comfy beds and helpful staff. The option for breakfast is included but having a bakery and a shop just around the corner meant we did not use this. The room we were given faced onto the road which is quiet and doesn't not disturb you despite having the window open.\nShower facilities were good yet small and the option of a safe for the room can be purchased at reception. The hairdryer does come in the room at no extra cost, but be aware that this is not that good so brining your own as well as universal adapter will be a good idea.\nThe location is good, having multiple metro options surrounding it and good cafes to eat and get a coffee. Metro routes take about 20 minutes to the heart of Paris which means you can easily go to the sites at a cheap fare and with an easy route with only a two minute walk to the 9 line which takes you to most main attractions.\nIf your French speaking skills are like ours and next to none then the hotel will be ideal for you. Staff at the hotel and surrounding restaurants spoke good English which made the experience easier.\nIf you're staying here for longer than 3 nights then I would advise making sure your room is a bigger one. As we were put in a room with limited space, no wardrobes/drawers which meant living out the suitcase was our only option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:20:51.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
