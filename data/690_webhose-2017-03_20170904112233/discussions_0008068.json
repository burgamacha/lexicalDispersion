Lovely room, nice size with good amenities and big comfortable bed. Staff very accommodating and friendly. Complimentary bag storage was helpful for sightseeing on the last day. Only downside was breakfast - thought we were getting a full English but turned out to be just continental. Could have upgraded for three pounds, but having seen a friends, decided not to. Service at breakfast was polite but hit and miss - they forgot our toast order on both mornings and there could have been a bit more things like fresh fruit salad and muesli. That said, we had enough to eat so not all bad. Would definitely stay here again. Free Wi-Fi was nice but it was quite slow sometimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:11:04.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
