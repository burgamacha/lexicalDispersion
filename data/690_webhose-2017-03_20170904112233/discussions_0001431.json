The staff were very welcoming and helpful and the hotel is very modern and very clean. The air-conditioning was very effective in the rooms. The shower was powerful and hot. Beds and pillows very comfortable. Vending machines available offering items from packed sandwiches to wines and beer to toothbrushes 24hrs per day. Everything was thought of. The hotel was close to many sights, all within walking distance. We ate one evening in the restaurant as we were too tired to go out and the food was excellent value for money.\nRoom Tip: We were on floor 4, it was lovely and quiet. Close to Restaurant.
