We ended up with a nice room with a small window. That was fine, but the bathroom configuration was a bit strange. We'd never seen a bathtub that could not be reached without walking through the shower. When I showered, I had a hard time not spraying the bathtub area. Just kind of funny. Otherwise, our stay for 2 nights was excellent. The club lounge serves excellent food -- although I'd like to suggest some vegetarian sushi along with the various fish sushi -- and well managed with good service.\nThe breakfast buffet had numerous choices, and the food was good. I have a couple of suggestions. First, make spoons available with fork and knife at the table. It was difficult to find a spoon. We had to ask for assistance with that. Second, the flow of people traffic from one end of the room to the other (a very long flow, considering the many food stations and options) made it difficult to move from one end to the other. The juices and coffee were clear on the other end from where we sat the first day of our stay.\nThe concierge and front desk were excellent. They answered all our questions and were very helpful in providing assistance to us in figuring out how we should get over to the Forbidden City -- it had snowed the day before and although we had planned to walk, the streets were icy. So they got us a cab to take half way, which worked out perfectly. We walked around the Forbidden City from East entrance to South entrance, and that area was already pretty clear of ice.\nThe proximity to The Forbidden City -- we easily walked back from the North exit of the Forbidden City -- and ease with which our driver came to take us to the Great Wall, makes this a good hotel location-wise too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:21:59.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
