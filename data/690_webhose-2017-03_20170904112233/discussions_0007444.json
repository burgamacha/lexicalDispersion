The location was fantastic, close to three local tube stations about a 10 minute walk away. Although the standard rooms were very small (there are larger rooms if you prefer but obviously will cost more per night) they were very clean, modern and the bed was extremely comfy which meant we'd rested well for the next day. We opted for a standard room which had a large flat screen television, wifi and an ensuite. There is breakfast on offer for an extra cost and free tea/coffee that you can help yourself to on the ground floor. Overall I enjoyed our stay and would probably stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:48:38.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
