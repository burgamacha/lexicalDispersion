It was honestly the best stay I've ever had at a hotel. Ritz included. The service was impeccable. It sometimes felt like we were the only ones there's. And the highlight of my day was the afternoon tea. Small delight but great communal feeling with the best little pastries. The dean was so helpful when it came to booking reservations, giving directions and assistance of every sort. With the language barrier it was nice to know I could trust their assessment of the best locations to tour from. The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for travel throughout Paris. The metro is just a5 min walk with trains that come every few minutes! Dollar for dollar I think any one would be hard pressed to find such service, location, and amenities in all of Paris!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:54:23.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
