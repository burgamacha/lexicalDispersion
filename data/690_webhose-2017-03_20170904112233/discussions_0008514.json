Wow! It was enormous - 2 good sized bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, huge sitting area with desk, sofa, stuffed chair, table & chairs for 4 plus a mini kitchen with microwave, fridge, and sink. The staff was so friendly and welcoming, especially bellhop David and the main doorman (sorry can't remember his name). We had a slight issue with cleanliness of the pullout couch and they were accommodating. The free wine hour is a nice touch, we enjoyed it almost every night. The only slightly annoying thing is the $10 credit at the \"market\" in the lobby that you have to \"use or lose\" each day. A bottle of smartwater was $9.60. But overall a fun place in a good location. We also stayed in a regular 2-queen room that was also very nice - clean, comfortable, stylish. Would definitely recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:55:38.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
