The location of this hotel is very central and makes it easy to go to places like the Trevi fountain and Colloseum. It is also off of the very nice streat Via de Nazionale which had lots of great shopping and food. Also, the restaurant upstairs had nice food, especially the $10 breakfast buffet in the morning. We also had dinner here once and they were very knowledgeable about nut allergies and able to recommend what I could eat. The room we stayed in was small, but very nice and had an excellent view.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:46:51.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
