Rooms are quite big and very very clean. Since it is located at Nanluoguxiang, do expect tourists (both local and foreign) to flood the streets. We however could not hear any street noises from our room so that was fine. The NLGX street is laden with plenty of shops and prices are pretty fair for most stuff.\nRoom Tip: Twin rooms seems to be on level 1 next to the common area. Double rooms are on level 2. :) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:23:21.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
