It had been 15 years since is been to New York and wa so excited to do lots of sightseeing while my husband was at his conference.\nWe had a corner room and had a great view of Radio City. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the lobby and amenities are really nice.\nThe very first day I started running fever and had to spend the next two days in bed with bronchitis! The staff was so great. Our housekeeper even offered to get some hot soup from the grill and OTC medicine from the shop for me.\nThe location is PERFECT! Located right in the middle of everything! By the third day I hit the ground running and was able to visit so many sites within walking distance of the hotel.\nMy husband and I have already agreed that when we go back, this hotel is a must. I highly recommend it.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:53:59.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
