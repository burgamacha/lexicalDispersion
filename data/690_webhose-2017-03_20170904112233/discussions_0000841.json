Close to the train station and fairly centered in the city within about 15 minutes walking distance to many sights like the Trevi Fountain for example. Friendly staff. Very clean and nice room, we had a double bed plus a single bed for our daughter, the room was spacious and cozy.\nBreakfast was served at the Cotto restaurant on the corner of the building and it was great. Good selection of breakfast foods, great coffee and very friendly service.\nWe loved our stay here and would definitely come here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:27:53.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
