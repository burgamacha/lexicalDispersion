Emily T. recommended the property and sent along Lauren Y and Colleen to help execute the stay. They had everything perfectly placed. Our group came with quite a few staffers and we had the entire floor to ourselves. Security was tremendous, the rooms had great views and the Principal, who has stayed in many hotels loved the property. The food was incredible and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. Michael B at the front desk even ran around the building to get us our taxi and rode to make sure it was at our pick up location. I will absolutely be staying here again and recommend for the food, view, and AWESOME beds!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:12:19.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
