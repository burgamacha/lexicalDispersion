Officially It may be a 3-4 Star hotel and the rooms are basic but very comfortable including the bed.\nNo swimming pool or Spa and if it did then likely it would be a 4-5 Star.\nBut for us... it was a 5 Star hotel because the quality of service and good foods for breakfast was excellent.\nHope you find our review helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:38:56.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
