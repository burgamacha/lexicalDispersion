The attention to detail in all of the bars, lounge areas, outdoor areas and the room were just amazing. I was lucky enough to have 4 balconies all with amazing views and all the mod cons you could wish for right down to the toilet. (I'm a big kid so couldn't stop waving my hand over the automatic toilet lid) We called room service for drinks and food on a few occasions and wasn't left waiting long. Great food, amazing service and could go on and on. Would most definitely stay here again! Photos I have attached really don't do the hotel justice in real life!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:29:23.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
