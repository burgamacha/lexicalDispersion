The check-in was fast and easy and the staff informative and warm. I had a Jr Suite and the attention to detail was high. Comfy bed. The room had a modern heating and cooling system so it was loud like some hotels in NYC. The gym while on the smaller side had fully functioning equipment. I ate breakfast at the restaurant. Good food but a little pricey for breakfast. All this and what a great location right by Carnegie Hall. I'd stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:25:45.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
