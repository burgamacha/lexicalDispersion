My husband organised a surprise weekend away for me and the hotel were very helpful in sorting out taxi's, guides, restaurant suggestions etc. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a lovely room which was cleaned daily and turned down in the evening. The breakfast was delicious and had lots of options, as it was sunny we sat out and ate on their sunny roof terrace. The positioning of the hotel couldn't be better for all the sights. I would highly recommend this hotel for a lovely stay in Rome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:27:43.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
