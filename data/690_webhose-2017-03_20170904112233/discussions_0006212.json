There are a number of restaurants nearby. There's a Metro just across the hotel.\nAmenities : there's a restaurant in the first floor, breakfast, laundry, bathrobes, slippers, mini bar, wifi - fast.\nRoom : adequate for 2 adults and 1 child, it's clean, there's a big tub in the bathroom. The handle in the bathroom got stuck. When my husband pulled hard - it got loosened. When we reported this to Mohamed (front desk) - he immediately offered a different room. We appreciated this a lot ... but we declined since we we're so tired at the end of everyday we were in Paris. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and the temperature - just right.\nStaff : Superlative words to Mohamed and Andre!!! Mohamed works the front desk, while Andre showed us the rooms and helped us with our heavy carry ons/luggage. We could not say enough great things how these 2 helped us. Mohamed/Andre were very helpful with all our needs including giving us anything we needed like extra drinks especially after our tiring but wonderful sightseeing in Paris. These 2 were the reason my daughter fell in love with Hotel Brighton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:30:30.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
