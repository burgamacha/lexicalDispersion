(It's also 1km from the subway and 2km from the Houhai bars, very convenient.) The front desk staff speak English and helped us book tickets for an acrobatics show. The chef serves a complimentary breakfast buffet every morning, and for a small extra fee she offers a fantastic private dumpling-making class.\nI have a few grumbles. Our room was interior, with only a small window overlooking the dining room. The floors weren't the cleanest and the bathroom door squeaked. Even so, I enjoyed the courtyard hotel experience and I'd return in a heartbeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:15:06.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
