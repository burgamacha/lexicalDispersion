The rooms are good sized for NYC and come very nicely appointed. I had an awesome tub...wished I had a romantic date to help me use it...lol. It made for a nice way to relax. Room was good, bed was too hard. The concierge Caitlin was amazing. She helped me with all kinds of suggestions and we could not do all she tried to set us up for, but great suggestions. The bar and resto in the hotel were pretty good, whoever is doing their drink menu is on point. Great cocktails. One night we tried to get top of the highline rezzies and we could only get in at 5p. Lame. They do not prioritize you as a guest already paying to stay. Went to the club on Sat night, line was long but moved fast. Get up there and it was whatever. Pretty view, mixed crowd and lots of 20somethings. Not my scene, had a drink a couple of dances then bolted. Check out was easy and I liked the bars and food. Go stay, the walk along the highlife at sunset is amazing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:50:15.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
