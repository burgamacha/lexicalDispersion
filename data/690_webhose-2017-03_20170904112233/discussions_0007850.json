Good selection of eateries if you want to stay close but would recommend travelling a bit further to get something different. Decor very like the Firmdale - quirky but totally in unison with each item of furniture etc. Rooms are comfortable beautifully decorated with all facilities. The red library is amazing with roaring fire. had wonderful fresh raspberry prosecco spritzers- a bit pricey but a treat. Staff can be a bit frosty but still professional.
