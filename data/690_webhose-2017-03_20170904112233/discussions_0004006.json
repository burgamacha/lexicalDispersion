This app is a god send for helping you use the metro to get around Paris.\nI stayed at Mercure for three nights with my partner on a city break. Getting from Charles De Gaulle airport to the hotel can be tricky but there two options without paying €50 for a taxi. 1- get the train at the airport to Gare du Nord and from there to Bonne Nouvelle which will take you within a two minute walk of the hotel or 2- get the Rossiy bus from the airport to the opera house and then walk 15 minutes to the hotel.\nOnce we arrived at the hotel the staff were so friendly and helpful, this was the case the whole week. The room was very clean and modern with a lovely view of the Parisian buildings in the street.\nWe did not eat in the hotel but there are so many cafè's and bakeries nearby.\nIf you are between 18-25 many of the main tourist attractions are free however if not I wouldn't say they were too expensive.\nI would definitely come back to this hotel again and can't recommend it enough!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:46:07.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
