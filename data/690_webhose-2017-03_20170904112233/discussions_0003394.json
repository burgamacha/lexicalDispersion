All rooms are decorated differently (they happily allowed me to have a sneak peek at some others during my stay because I was curious) and appointed to the highest of standards! Bose music speakers in each room, sky TV (with a sanitized remote control!!!!), free bottled water every day, berocca on their mini bar...the list is endless!\nThe staff are 2nd to none. Words cannot describe how much they GENUINELY take an interest in you. I don't know how they do it with so many different guests coming in and out but when returning in the evening they would hand me my room key without me having to say a single word! I felt like I was so important! Special mention to the housekeeping maids because the whole place is spotless!\nI shall be back whenever I can get time off work to go back to London!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:59:12.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
