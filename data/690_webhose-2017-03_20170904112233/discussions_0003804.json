He really took initiative and made our stay wonderful. My wife was expecting and since we arrived way too early, he had housekeeping place a stuffed animal for us to take home as a gift from the hotel as they made the finishing touches on the room. Drinks were also offered in the lounge and were on the house. He and the concierge staff made sure that any recommendations or reservations we had in the city were aware of my wife's dietary restrictions and made sure our comfort would be tended to. Bravo to Paul and the front desk staff.\nAlso, Maeva in the restaurant and the bar, another top notch staff member. Always extremely prompt, helpful and anticipated whatever we needed before we even knew we did. The service she provided was excellent and really made our stay so enjoyable.\nAs for the hotel, the room was gorgeous and the amenities were beautiful as well.\nBed was extremely comfortable and the room was always very tidy. Turn down service occurred every night so linens, towels and bathroom amenities were always fresh\nThe doormen are some\nOf the friendliest I've ever encountered in any country let alone France and we're so attentive and courteous at all times.\nThe breakfast at this hotel was excellent. There was always a wonderful spread and the eggs were prepared to perfection.\nThe lounge and the lounge staff were top notch.\nI've stayed at Le Crillon and Four Seasons in Paris and I have to say this SPG property are superior to both. Bravo to Prince De Galles, I cannot wait to come back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:52:30.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
