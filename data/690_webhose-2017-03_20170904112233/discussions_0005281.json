It doesn't have strong smell inside the hotel. There is a funeral house next to the hotel. The breakfast is for free for the first 2 person in each room (even book for more people, the breakfast is still for 2 person). It is not buffet. There is several choices: pancake, waffle, etc.. Only one coffee or tea, no refill. The amount was small. I was half full after finished mine... and I'm a tiiny girl. The room was relatively clean. They only provide one soap for us. Our room was connected to the neighbor one through a two-door. It is a little bit loud as we can hear their TV. But the street was relatively quite. We stayed in winter. The room was warm. We had a morning flight and booked a taxi with them. It was $58 + tips. Paid in cash the night before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:14:24.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
