The floor is just like the photos, a very cozy place with a very modern decoration. The area is well connected, about 5 minutes from metro stops, a charming place where you can feel a Londoner more. An experience that if we had stayed in other areas we would not have lived to enjoy. The Hyde park garden, the royal Albert hall, the natural history museum are one of the best things to enjoy in this venue. we truly enjoyed the outdoor area reserved on the queens gate side, There was a terrace which was lovely and elegantly decorated with spring pinkish flowery wall as well as a bed of lilies on the bottom. we loved sitting in this area and enjoy seeing the locals going about their business.\nThe hotel currently serves a beauty and the beast themed afternoon tea which was very delicious and an experience never to be forgotten from the clock tower to the ice cream cone.\nWe were amazed how they over delivered on the service especially Martyn,Vincent and George at the Concierge's department, they gave us excellent tips and advice. we highly recommend this charming hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:24:27.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
