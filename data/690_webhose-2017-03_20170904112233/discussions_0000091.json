We've tried a host of NYC hotels to include the Plaza, both major Marriotts, The Intercontinental, The Michelangelo many others but for our purposes we found our stay at the Benjamin to be just right in many respects The attractive transitional furnishings were a pleasant surprise and our room was nice and quiet.. All systems worked as desired; great water pressure, efficient elevators but we especially appreciated the kitchenette with a good working microwave that allowed us to order in and enjoy great Indian food on real dinnerware while escaping the frigid temperatures outside.\nEverything we needed for a pleasant stay was provided. The staff were friendly and accommodating and upon checkout at 6am there were no issues with our prepaid bill. We are already planning our next return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:42:07.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
