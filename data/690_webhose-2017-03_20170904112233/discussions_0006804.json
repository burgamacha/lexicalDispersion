It is very convenient when you drive from the west along the M4. It has secure parking which is reasonably priced if you are staying at the hotel. It is located in the centre of Hammersmith with easy access to a variety of bars and places to eat. It is also easy to get a tube into central London. The rooms are clean and fresh and a reasonable size. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. The is a buffet breakfast included in the price.
