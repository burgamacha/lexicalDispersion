In true La Quinta fashion, I was not disappointed. Everyone was very tentative, nice and helpful. The room size was sufficent for us. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because of the water temperature. It was either really hot or really cold so when we washed our faces in the sink it was hard to get the water temp on warm. Other than that this hotel was great. The location is perfect. I stayed at a hotel on the same street last year so I already knew I wanted to be in the same area again. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone that wants a great NY trip without spending the high amount of money.\nRoom Tip: Perfect location in mid-town See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:56:43.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
