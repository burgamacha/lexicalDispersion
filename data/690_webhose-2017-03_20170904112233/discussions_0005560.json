We walked to the theater, a huge plus, didn't need to bother with cabs etc. Also close to great restaurants and Times Square. Bed was very comfortable-linens were perfect-great rooftop bar, don't miss that. Room had beautiful hard wood floor and modern bathroom-windows the whole length of the wall. Hotel also has a great restaurant, food is delicious-oh!! I can't forget, upon check my husband mentioned in passing that it was my birthday and the sent us up a great bottle of champagne and choc covered strawberries-how sweet! We will be staying here every time we venture into the city!!\nRoom Tip: Get a room with a view of the Empire State Building-so pretty See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:09:58.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
