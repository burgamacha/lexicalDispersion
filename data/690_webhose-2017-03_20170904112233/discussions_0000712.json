The hotel itself was well appointed and clean. The location is great! It is easy to walk to the major tourist sights and close to tube stations. There are restaurants all around the hotel. The view from our room was of the roof-a little disappointing but not a big problem. We were thrilled when we arrived at 10 am and they allowed us to check right in (much needed after an all night flight). They gave great advice and directions for heading out to sightsee. We were even offered use of umbrella's as it looked like rain. When we arrived back to the hotel around 8pm after a day of sightseeing and asked the concierge where we could find a bit of clotted cream to go with our leftover scones, he not only went and found the cream but jam as well. We would definetly stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:09:21.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
