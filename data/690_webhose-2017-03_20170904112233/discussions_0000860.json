The room was clean, comfortable and and had all the basics that you need; including tea/coffee making facilities and a good bathroom. (The bath was a lifesaver after a day sightseeing!) Breakfast was varied and never seemed to be busy and the staff were polite and welcoming whenever we passed the reception desk.\nThe hotel itself is closeby to metro stations and cafe/brasseries and we found everything we needed within walking distance. We would definately recommend and would certainly return if we were to plan another visit to Paris in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:39:36.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
