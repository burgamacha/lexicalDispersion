Made better by the wonderful and unique hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a colourful North African theme. The room was very comfortable and clean and you say we were in a bustling city very quiet too. The staff were polite, helpful and friendly which was nice too. Breakfast was very tasty and fresh with plenty of options and was always a great start to the day. Couldn't fault anything that wouldn't be personal preference, so I won't. We would definitely go back and will recommend to others. Merci.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:26:51.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
