Starting with the reception - we've mainly contacted Ivan and Valentina who were great, very helpful and all the others starting from the guy who has helped us with the luggage, the waiters in the restaurant and the cleaning lady. I'm sorry that I cannot remember their names.\nThe hotel is well located most of the attractions are in walkind distance.\nThe rooms are spacious, modern designed, sparkling clean and very very pampering - starting with the free mini-bar which is refiled daily (this is the first one I've seen), and the bathroom facilities - which many hotels now are reducing.\nAlso the room is well lit which is very nice, lots of lights.\nThen there is the breakfast - this is the \"bad\" thing :), say goodbye to diet.... One of the best breadfasts, great veriety, and there is also a waiter who passes with fresh Ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarela cheese, and special cakes.\nWe didn't have time to try the rooftop restaurant, but we've seen it and it looks very romantic. We will certainly try it next time.\nWe are looking forward to getting back to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:28:00.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
