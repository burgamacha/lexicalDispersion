Every staff member from the front desk to the breakfast staff were incredibly sweet, attentive, and ready to help in any way.\nBreakfast was included since we booked our reservation in advance - and it was delicious! The hotel is walking distance from two very useful metro stations and located on a quiet street that still feels safe to walk alone at night.\nI've never had a more enjoyable stay in any hotel - the Hotel Joyce's level of service was really incredible and I long to return to Paris so I can stay here again!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:58:31.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
