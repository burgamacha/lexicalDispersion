Hats off to the management team and all staff, we felt very much at home here! Housekeeping was extremely discrete and our room was pleasant. I would however choose a larger room next time.\nIt was only by chanced that we decided to eat in the restaurant one evening and I am so glad we did. It was a top notch meal and the ambience in the dining room was standout.\nThe weather was kind during our stay and we were greatly assisted by the approachable concierge who researched the best way for us to visit our places of interest.\nWhat we liked best was the very courteous and professional service shown to us by everyone, great food and drink in the bar and restaurant. The least impressive aspects are the opposite side of good service. Breakfast was oversubscribed on one day and there was a lengthy wait for seating and service. My breakfast arrived lukewarm which is not to my taste. Some of the breakfast team were anxious and others laid back and there didn't seem to be anyone martialling a cohesive approach. Sadly our final bill required a significant correction .The receptionist was embarrassed and very apologetic but I do expect better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:45:27.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
