We were going to drop off our luggage so that we could go and explore for the day. We got to the hotel at approx. 12pm, explained that we had a reservation and would like to leave our luggage for the day until we could check in. The very friendly staff offered to check and see if a room was available already, and it was. They did not charge us for an early check-in, and it was so nice to be able to store our luggage safely in our room. All the staff were very friendly and the room was the usual good standard for a Premier Inn. We did not eat our evening meal in the restaurant, but we did have breakfast and the choice was excellent and everything was cooked well. There is a Costa Coffee attached to the hotel which was also very handy. I was also very impressed that despite the fact we were on a main road, the traffic noise was minimal and we slept very well. Although we were only there for one night we were very satisfied with everything. We would not hesitate to stay there again. By the way it is only a 5 minute walk from Euston Station which is also very useful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:30:13.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
