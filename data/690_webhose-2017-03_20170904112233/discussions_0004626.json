We did not want the usual cookie-cutter chain hotel. Great choice.The hotel is very conveniently located in midtown, on the edge of the business district and within walking distance of Broadway and Times Square. We had deliberately chosen to be near Broadway since we hoped to catch a show on our weekend visit for a family celebration. It's description is \"trendy\" which is correct. Minimalist foyer and cool room with original art. The usual hotel \"stuff\" but with a microwave and dishwasher! The room looked fresh, the bathroom was well lit and there were some nice touches like two bathrobes and an umbrella. Our room was on the 16th floor which was great since New York was far away and quiet.\nAllan and Ingrid at the front desk could not have been more friendly and helpful. They checked us in very quickly and then, at half past midnight, made some suggestions as to where to eat, room service having stopped at 11pm.\nWe would definitely come back to this location. It was very reasonably priced and a pleasure to stay at.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:06:53.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
