On this occasion I had a one night stay to meet some old work colleagues and wanted to be near the meeting place in trafalger square, and ever since this hotel opened I wanted an excuse to stay and here was the perfect opportunity. What a place, from being greeted on the curb side to the immediate modern tranquility of reception, the superbly efficient front desk staff to the room it was a pleasure to check in. Then the room, compared with many central city hotels it was spacious, beautifully designed with a huge bed, dressing area, then the bathroom. The amenities were abundant even allowing you to purchase a Gillette razor from the shelf if you had forgotten yours. I am often disappointed with water pressure and showers in hotels, not St Martin's the huge soak tub (complete with bubble bath provided) filled in a minute. I can not enthuse about this hotel much more except to say the bed was heavenly, large and meant the best nights sleep in over a week of travels. I will be back without hesitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:24:15.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
