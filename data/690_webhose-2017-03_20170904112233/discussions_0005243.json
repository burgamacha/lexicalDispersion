I arrived on a Saturday morning at 11 am. Check in is at 3 but the receptionist told me if I waited in the sitting area, a room would be ready shortly. And it was! I had room 1912. No view (just looking at another building) but the room was very clean and quiet. They fit rooms with some gym equipment which is a nice idea, but not really much room for a workout. Bathroom was nicely stocked and the room came with a mini-fridge so you could store food/wine. I didn't have a chance to check out the gym. The next day, I asked if I could check out late (checkout is at 11 am) and they allowed me to stay until 2:00 pm without charge. Staff are all very friendly and nice. I'd definitely recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:14:58.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
