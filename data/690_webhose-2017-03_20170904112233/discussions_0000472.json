Since we prefer the 6th for shopping and dining, it is an excellent location. Walking distance to everything we frequent but also moments away from the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay or Place de la Concorde.\nHaving stayed before at the Georges V, Sofitel, Plaza Athenee, I can say Hotel Montalembert is now our preference. Beautifully appointed and intimate enough to feel like your personal hotel.\nThe entire staff was welcoming, very helpful and most importantly, seemed genuinely kind and happy taking care of their guests. Pascal was amazing and did everything to ensure that my birthday was very special. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:54:07.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
