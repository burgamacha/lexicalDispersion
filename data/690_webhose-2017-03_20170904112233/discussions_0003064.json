The ride from the Orly to the hotel was about 30 minutes on uber and cost â‚¬40. The hotel is dog friendly so they got point for that. The location was as great as I thought it was and close to everything by walk+ metro station (chatlet outside of the hotel). Check in (with the guy from Portugal) went smoothly and super friendly!!!!\nTwo things that disappointed me- the room / hotel didn't look as fresh/new/chic as in the photos. Actually my room was super small.\nThe other thing was when I went to breakfast everything was almost gone. So when I asked when are they going to refill it I was told 20 minutes, which meant that I was sitting there waiting for the food. Aside to that dinning room was messy and tables were not picked up.\nI would probably stay there again because if the location unless I find good deal in hotel in the area.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:19:53.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
