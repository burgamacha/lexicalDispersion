They got us a room straight away and the issue was resolved.\nRooms a good size. Clean, modern and a great view of Times Square.\nOverall a really good experience and would definitely recommend! Good location for exploring the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:58:55.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
