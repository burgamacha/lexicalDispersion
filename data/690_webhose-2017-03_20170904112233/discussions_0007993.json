I had a nice welcome upon arrival and was told l had been put at the back of the hotel which is much quieter as its away from the main road which is very busy. The room itself was nice and clean and suited all my requirements. The bed was nice and comfy too. Pricing is good for the location and good value for money. You're close to all transport connections, the Olympic park and, of course, Westfield shopping centre. Would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:25:05.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
