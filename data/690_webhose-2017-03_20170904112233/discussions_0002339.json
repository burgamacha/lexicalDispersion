It's very conveniently located (5' walk from the RER stop Luxembourg and a little further from the Metro St Michel). My (superior) room was a real surprise: spacious, reasonably clean, silent, with a beautiful view overlooking Paris roofs. I say it was a surprise as the door was quite small and outdated, but the room was really very nice. Also the wifi connection was good and reliable. Breakfast is quite basic but complete. I cannot comment on the price because I was there on business and the room was paid by my host. Will consider this hotel again should I be in Paris another time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:21:26.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
