Our stay was a trip to remember because of the service we got. Ms Khan and the whole concierge team made our stay very comfortable and arranged all the nice things for the birthday including a birthday cake and bucket of lovely roses. Hotel manager, Mr Thesing, also did his utmost for us to enjoy our visit. Thank you! We can really recommend this stylish NUO-chain hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:20:58.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
