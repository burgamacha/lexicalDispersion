We were spending a couple of days around London, so the location of this hotel was perfect. It is literally right outside euston, there is a back entrance to the station, which takes you straight to the hotel.\nArrived at 3pm, check in was easy. There's no actual reception, so you get approached by a friendly hotel rep who does check in etc in the lobby.\nThe room was nice, standard and not huge, with a comfy bed and decent bathroom. Not noisy and we had a good nights sleep.\nChecked out really easily the next morning, there is a luggage room to use if you're off out and need to come back later but don't fancy taking bags with you!\nWe returned early evening to retrieve our bags and made quick use of the communal area/bar, where we charged our phones and used the free wifi.\nIt's a good hotel in a good location, with a nice open lobby for relaxing in.\nWould recommend", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:29:02.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
