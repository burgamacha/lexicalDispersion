Breakfast was fresh and abundant; dinner not served in the hotel, but many good choices nearby. The staff made several recommendations for dinner, and we were never disappointed. Nice rooftop seating area, with bar service seasonally. Ideally located for touring major sites, and very pleasant, helpful staff. Highly recommend this property.
