Knowing that we will be outside the hotel most of the time, we decided to book at Hotel de la Tour Eiffel because of its close proximity to Eiffel Tower. Most of the reviews were negative to the point of disappointing potential travelers. We almost cancelled but trusting our gut, we decided to push through with our reservation. AND WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. The staff were very warmth, the rooms were very clean (we got the adjoining rooms for a family of 5), the bathrooms were just alright (to European standards I suppose) and the beds were so comfy. Noise is not a problem during our four (4) nights stay - except maybe for my snore, and the kids rested just like at home.\nOnly Cons I supposed: - Coffeemaker, but for the price we couldn't anymore seem to bother.\nSo there you go folks, enjoy your stay in Paris! Don't panic with what you read here. You're much closer to the famous Eiffel Tower than you can imagine when you book at Hotel de la Tour Eiffel\nRoom Tip: we got the rooms on the 1st level (not ground floor) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:48:11.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
