It's a number of buildings in the old Hutung slum area which have been sympathetically converted into a clean, modern small B&B. the room was a bit small but otherwise perfectly acceptable.\nThe neighbourhood itself is very interesting - part of the disappearing China; there are still communal washhouses in the area. That said the area is very clean & feels very safe if you ignore people riding electric bikes with no lights at night. Also convenient for local amenities such as the bars & restaurants around Qianhai Lake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:00:36.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
