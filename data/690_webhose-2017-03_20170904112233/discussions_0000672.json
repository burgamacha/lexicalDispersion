We arrived early morning to the hotel and our room was not ready. we walked around the city for a while and when we came back our room was still not ready. We requested a view of the Eiffel Tower and a king bed. They advised us they had a room with a queen bed and on a higher floor than our original room. We took the room and we were blown away with the view of the Eiffel Tower, it was like we could almost touch it and got the most amazing pictures of it from our window. Its an older Hotel but it feels like it brings you back in time. Our room was pretty small but had everything we needed, we didnt spend much time in the room. It was centrally located and was within walking distance of many must see sights. We would definately stay there again.\nRoom Tip: cant go wrong with a view of the Eiffel Tower See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:17:39.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
