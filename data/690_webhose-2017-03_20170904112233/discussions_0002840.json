It is ideally placed to walk to St Denis and the Stad Du France. Easy to get to by public transport and indeed public transport is cheap and plentiful all over Paris. They were very strict about the bar closing times and leaving the lobby. However I believe this was due to the rioting and a coach full of Korean tourists that were robbed not far away. They happily served us but said we must be out of the public area at midnight. So if anything they were actually looking after the guests given there was problems in the area. Rooms and all areas were spotless, loved the fact you had to use your room key to operate the lift. Staff were polite and very helpful, in fact I left a jumper and they arranged its safe return to me. The area is \"up and coming\" but can feel a little intimidating. But we found a caf√© bar just down the road. It was full of locals and we soon got chatting and had a great night. The breakfast had a good cold range but the hot one was a bit limited and could have been warmer. The pillows were a bit hard and I thought there was usually a pillow menu in Marriott? All in all a nice hotel and quiet. I would go back and ideal for the rugby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:53:23.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
