The cherry on top of this trip, the hotel and ridiculously amazing customer Service- truly beyond exceptional!\nLet me start off by raving about their outstanding staff, how diligent and impeccable they all were with every little detail and effort to make our stay absolutely wonderful. Carlos (a true star here) worked closely with my boyfriend's assistant to make sure I got a warm and special birthday welcome (which I absolutely did)! Zachary also took time to whip up an amazing list of go-to restaurants in NY, if only I had a few more days to hit up every place he recommended. The staff seriously finds pleasure in being really good at there job and making the guests happy. Love love that!\nAll in all, Arlo Nomad is a very posh and updated hotel but I will say that the room is seriously micro (yes, very small). If you want a hotel in a great location, comfortable bed,\namazing service, a place to relax... I would definitely recommend this hotel.\nThanks again, Carlos and staff! Will see you guys again soon. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:00:52.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
