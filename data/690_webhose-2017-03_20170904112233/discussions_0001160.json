Comfy big bed & nice bathroom with great bath & shower.\nStaff could not have been more helpful and I was a fairly demanding guest. Arrived too early and they allowed us early check in, recommended and booked an English speaking hairdresser for a blowdry (which by the way was fabulous), lent us cables for devices and adaptors, bought us breakfast in bed upon request, allowed late check out due to inability to move as a result of the hangover from hell, bought up headache tablets for afore-mentioned...literally all in their stride without a fuss. Full salute to all staff, I love you for giving me longer to recover.\nI have a client that asked for a report on La Maison Favert as her team visit Paris regularly and I have given it the FULL thumbs up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:30:46.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
