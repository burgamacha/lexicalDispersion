Our first stay was 6 days in a standard room. We had requested a late check in and this went very smoothly. Although the room was quite small, (as are most), it was comfortable and had a great bed. The weather was very cool and raining, so it was nice that the heat worked very well.\nThe included breakfast was very good. Very comfortable restaurant offered a nice selection of hot and cold foods with great croissants and the best coffee. Looked forward to this every morning.\nAll staff were very friendly and helpful, offering advice on what to do and see as well as what good restaurants were nearby. The location of the hotel on a quiet narrow street just added to the ambience. The Eiffel Tower is only a 10 to 15 minute walk away and there are bakeries and grocery stores just around the corner.\nWe left Paris for a week and returned here for 2 more nights and, once again, everything was perfect. Even had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from this room! Thanks for the upgrade!\nWe loved our time at Les Jardins dâ€™Eiffel and hope to return again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:17:39.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
