We spend our first night elsewhere, but as I got to London I decided to book the other nights here: maybe one of the best choice I did!\nThe hotel is clean and nice, staff is kind and available for every request. Position is ridiculously good, there are two undergroud stops in a 300 meters range (District-Circle and Central line). Very near to Kengsinton park.\nBreakfast is good.\nIn few words I'll always check for this hotel when I'll get back in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:12:37.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
