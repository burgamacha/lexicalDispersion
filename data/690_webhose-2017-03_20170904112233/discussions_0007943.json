It did not disappoint ...from the prearrival to the stay itself. There's an OLCI which allows floor and room to be picked from a map. And an electronic concierge for your phone.\nEmail queries prior to stay were dealt with promptly and the personal greeting at check in meant that staff had actually seen these. The room was lovely and as booked. Common areas eg lounge were pleasant . On Leicester Square so very convenient location. Overall an excellent choice for central London .\nSpecial thanks for the birthday cake and wine that was placed in my mother's room ...a lovely surprise and welcome personal touch. Special thanks also to Annaise for her wonderful guest service and communication skills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:59:24.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
