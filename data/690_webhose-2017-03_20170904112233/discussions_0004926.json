The gentleman on the front desk was very friendly and polite and ever so kind to upgrade our room. The hotel is situated in a great location, literally 5-7 mins walk to the train station(Gare de l'est) and plenty of restaurants nearby. The price is very reasonable for the quality service you receive. definitely will be coming back if we ever visit Paris again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:26:35.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
