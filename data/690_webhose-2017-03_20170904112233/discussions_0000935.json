From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble. When we arrived one of our rooms was not quite ready so we were shown to the bar for complementary drinks - proper drinks not a glass of warm prosecco we have had elsewhere. We were kept informed when the room would be ready and the staff were genuinely apologetic for the delay.\nThe rooms themselves were exemplary- everything well fitted and perfectly clean. We had two deluxe twin rooms.\nA great example of the thoughtful service was when we mentioned that we were celebrating one of our son's birthday when we booked a table in the Cinq restaurant - a bottle of complementary champagne and cakes were in his room when we returned from our day out.\nWe visited just before Christmas and the decorations in the reception were exceptional.\nThe cost of luxury and service does not come cheap but the value for money is just about right.\nThoroughly recommended as \"the\" luxury hotel to stay in when visiting Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:31:01.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
