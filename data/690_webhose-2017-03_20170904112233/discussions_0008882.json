Great location steps away from Central Park as well as restaurants, shops, subways, etc. The hotel has a beautiful eco-friendly design throughout which is very well maintained. You can definitely tell that the team takes great pride in the upkeep. We were in a Park Suite which had fabulous views of Central Park and so many small touches that show an extraordinary attention to detail. Everyone was extremely warm and friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful. Greeted pleasantly when coming and going from the hotel and truly made to feel at home. We also had the pleasure of enjoying the scrumptious brunch in Jams. A vast variety of deliciousness…. best avocado toast the I’ve ever had – yum!\nWe’ll definitely be back!\nRoom Tip: Park Suite has great views of Central Park See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:12:32.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
