The check-in process was executed flawlessly and immediately found myself proceeding onward and upward to the 26th floor. Myself and my significant other where stunned by the gorgeous views of the city skyline. Slept comfortably and overall enjoyed a spotless and well-maintained room. My stay concluded with brunch at the fun, laid back restaurant of Massoni.\nHighly recommend.
