Since the tickets were so expensive, we needed a moderately priced hotel to balance the budget, but wanted to be near Times Square. This hotel met all expectations. It was a smaller hotel that is literally a block from the Richard Rodgers- you can see Times Square from the entrance of the building when there isn't construction going on next door.\nThe room was NYC sized, and we did not have a view from the window (it was just brick outside). However, this is balanced by its proximity to everything- Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, and train/subway lines all around it. It could not be more convenient for a trip to NYC. We were able to leave our stuff in the room and pop in if we needed anything without going out of our way.\nThe front desk staff was great. They were very kind and accommodating and after the first day recognized my partner and I and greeted us on our return. The maintenance guy was a bit grumpy when we needed help in our room (the bathroom window didn't shut all the way, and in the middle of 20 degrees weather I needed it closed!)\nBreakfast is simple- pancakes/waffles, cereal, toast/bagels, yogurt, and eggs. I mostly used the free breakfast to start my day and then ended up eating well for lunch and dinner. But for simplicity and to save money it was great having the option right there.\nI'll stay here in the future any time I come to NYC for fun. It's a great little hotel near everything we needed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:17:44.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
