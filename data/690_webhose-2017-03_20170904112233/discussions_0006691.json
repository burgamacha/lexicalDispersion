This was a short walk from Victoria. Check in and out was easy. Our room was very clean and furnishings seemed new. Loved the strip for all the power sockets..UK, USA and European...just what we needed. Had room service and for two vegetarians it was quite good. The room was over heated when we arrived but quickly cooled down when we turned all the heat off. Although we did not do it this time, it is a very pleasant walk from Victoria down to the Thames and the Houses of Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:01.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
