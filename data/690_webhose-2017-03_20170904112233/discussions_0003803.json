Metro station with access to the two Metro lines A and B, as well as to a lot of buses, connect you with all must-go places in the city. Trains in Termini allow to travel to other cities or to other countries. Reaching the hotel from the airport is a half-hour non-stop travel with the Leonardo Express train.\nCleanliness is something to be enhanced, as well as the courtesy and professionalism of the whole staff.\nWiFi connection is good in the whole hotel.\nBreakfast is remarkable good. A full Italian breakfast to fulfill the desires and tastes of people coming from everywhere. The staff at the breakfast room is so kind and always ready to answer your requests efficiently and quickly, no matter how full the breakfast room is (and frequently it is completely full).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:16:48.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
