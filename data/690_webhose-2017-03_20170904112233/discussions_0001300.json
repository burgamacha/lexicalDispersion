The room was nice and cleaned daily. Lovely pool and sauna. Gym is also available enough equipment for a workout to get by while away. Location is AMAZING and is perfect for times square but not too close that you can hear all the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough that you are about a 2 min walk away.\nCons: Few small issues as the room became hot very quickly due to the size and there being three of us in the room. We tried opening the window but we where unable to keep it open due to the smell of greasy food coming in. We called and asked for the aircon to be checked after another call and an hour or so wait someone came and fiddled with it but nothing came of the situation. We asked for a possible room change but the hotel was fully booked for our size room so we where unable to move. Sliding door for the bathroom would not lock and left a small opening leaving the shower visable which made getting ready slightly awkward as we could see each other showering.\nOverall besides these small issues, we had an amazing experience and would happily stay in the hotel again but in a different room.\nTriplet room\n3 people\n6 Days 5 Nights Feb 11th-16", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:57:30.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
