The rooms are light, airy and clean. The showers are excellent. The buffet breakfast is good quality food, varied and kept stocked until the moment the buffet is closed. Above all, without exception, the staff are polite, friendly, helpful and very welcoming. It is on a main road but you cannot hear any traffic noise in the rooms. Transport links by bus and tube excellent. It is always a pleasure to stay here and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\nRoom Tip: all pretty much the same See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:42:57.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
