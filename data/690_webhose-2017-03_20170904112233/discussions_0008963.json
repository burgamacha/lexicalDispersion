The staff at reception were extremely helpful however & went out of their way to sort me out with a room very efficiently. The rooms are always spotlessly clean & comfortable. You might find them small if you had a lot of luggage but I rarely have so not a problem. Bathrooms have all you need & good quality showers with plenty of hot water. There are no tea & coffee facilities in rooms but it is available in the foyer by reception 24 hours. Everything & more than you might expect at the price so good value for London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:22:47.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
