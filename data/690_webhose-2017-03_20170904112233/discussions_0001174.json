While the price was very budget friendly by North American standards (about $115/night), we felt like the rich and famous every time we returned to the hotel. Very easy walking distance to shopping etc. Starbucks next to the hotel (but expensive). The concierge desk was always helpful. Check-in and out went very smoothly. Highly recommended. We did not use the restaurant so I cannot comment on that", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:44:49.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
