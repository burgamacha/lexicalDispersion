Perfect for a weekend break. Rooms aren't massive but perfect for what we wanted. So close to everything that we wanted to see. Staff were very helpful. Best thing was that we hadn't included breakfast when we booked but we did one two occasions try the express breakfast for 8 euros which was perfect and a really good cheap option rather than paying out for a big and expensive breakfast. All round a great hotel at the usual Mercure standard and would definitely go back if went back to Paris again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:43:43.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
