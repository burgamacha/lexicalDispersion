We took the Heathrow Express to Paddington, and then a 10 minute cab ride to the hotel...very quick and easy. The room was bigger than I expected. Because this hotel is only a year old, it is new and clean. Decor is modern. It's located a block from Buckingham Palace, and within walking distance of the Victoria station. The staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is very reasonably priced, considering it's London. The bed was very, very comfortable. This hotel is a great find!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:05:23.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
