First the two double bedroom was given on 2nd floor and very small size that we can't putbour luggages. But on the next day one room is upgraded to a bigger one . The kitchen set on every room is really helpful for us to warm some meals. But on our third night a fire alarm struck around 3.30 am and so we rushed down . Only one staircases is available! Later we were informed that was not real fire but someone had taken shower with hot water that makes the fire alarm alerts ! And the fire alarm repeated twice that night which is quite disturbing our sleep. I hope that they had repair so the fire alarm in the shower not to sensitive ! The location is good many small cafes and shops and just 5 minutes walk to hyde park or paddington station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:52:36.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
