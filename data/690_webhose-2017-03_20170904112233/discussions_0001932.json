Given the snow and freezing conditions, I had underestimated how important an express major station would be.\nThe room was not as small as some reviews imply, had everything I needed and was very clean. I asked for a quiet room, and it was very quiet. Wifi worked well, and the little kitchen gave me all I needed. I wasn't very impressed with the diner on one side, but on the next corner was an excellent bakery and cafe. The pharmacy / supermarket next door was terrific. The laundry nearby did a great job.\nBut for me the best feature was the staff. As a mature aged woman landing from Australia with limited experience traveling, I asked some questions which must have seemed very silly. Every question was answered with care and excellent advice. Having friendly people at the desk 24/7 made me feel safe. Mike, in particular, did everything he could to be helpful.\nEven if I had ample money for a far more expensive hotel, I would return to the Newton.\nRoom Tip: I asked for quiet and got it. I choose for my own bathroom. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:35:51.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
