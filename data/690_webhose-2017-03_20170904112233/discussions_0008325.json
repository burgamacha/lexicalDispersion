Of course you expect a certain level of service but everyone from the front desk to wait staff to room cleaners just went above and beyond.\nThe roof top pool was lovely to have a dip in. It's only small but very adequate.\nThe price of \"add ons\" is quite staggering but of course you could say you'd expect that. If you're a Qatari in for a week's shopping, it's probably nothing, but as an average Joe Punter who'd saved up for a treat with my other half and come across on the Eurostar it was an eye opener. A basket of pastries and two coffees? About GBP50. Same for two drinks in the (very nice) bar. Yes, I know, I know, it goes with the territory but we certainly popped out for coffee and croissant the next day.\nIf you are a mere mortal and not a Middle Eastern prince and you want a treat hotel for a special occasion I would heartily recommend Le Bristol: it is grand and elegant and very friendly without being at all stuffy whatsoever.\nI can only dream about coming back again and certainly hope to do so, I think I'm just a bit in love with the place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:47:42.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
