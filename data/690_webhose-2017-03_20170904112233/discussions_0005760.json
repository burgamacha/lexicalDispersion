Everyone was very helpful from the valet to the front desk. The room was extremely comfortable, quiet and plush on the third floor. We went to the Dan White magic show in the hotel and it was very entertaining. The library bar is a wonderfully relaxing and beautiful bar and much quieter than the back bar in the hotel, so we could talk about how great the magic show was! The NoMad is convenient to many other restaurants in the area and also the Sex Museum.
