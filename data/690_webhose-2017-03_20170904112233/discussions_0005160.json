The staff was so very nice and professional; they immediately made me feel welcomed. They gave me a room with a view of Lake Victoria: could I just stay here forever?! So relaxing, so peaceful. Food was good, view was great and I was able to rest and decompress as I prepared for a very early flight the next day. One minor problem- they didn't call me for me 5am wake up call (bring your own alarm) and the doors in the bathroom need to be finished (hotel is undergoing renovations). Will stay here again. Protea already has a good name in Africa and now it's affiliated with Marriott so that's good too.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a view of Lake Victoria See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:57:38.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
