Our 3 night stay was highlighted by the very friendly and helpful staff, the most comfortable hotel bed ever, and a convenient location.\nTurn down service every night featured a different sweet treat from local candy establishments. It was truly a sweet stay!\nThe rooms are small, but extremely well designed. It even had a small refrigerator where we could store cold drinks. Visit the rooftop bar for a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. Try the Charlie Palmer restaurant on the lobby level for great food and service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:50:26.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
