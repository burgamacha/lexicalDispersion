Can change money, sell bus and tour tickets, etc- a full service front desk. Very nice hotel; rooms and bathrooms spacious, clean and well appointed (we had rooms 608 and 608A) with large balconies. Only downside is it's in a residential area that does not have restaurants or cafes within close walking distance. Hotel does have a lobby bar and on site restaurant. On recommendation we took the city bus downtown to catch the Hop On Hop Off bus, buying our tickets at the hotel front desk along with Hop on hop off ticket deposits; the city bus turned into more of an adventure than we planned. i admit it- we struggled with the Rome bus schedules and maps. All day. Bus routes weren't running, schedules had changed, bus stops weren't clear. But the hotel is close to city center however too far to walk really, and Uber is available which we should have done. Highly recommend the hotel as a comfortable place to stay.\nRoom Tip: higher room for a view; good elevators and easy to access stairs. car park underneath.
