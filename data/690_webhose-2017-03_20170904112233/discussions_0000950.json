The shower room was separate to the toilet (no sink in with the toilet), and both were also very small, so would not be suitable for anyone of a larger stature. The rainfall shower lacked pressure, but the handheld shower also attached was much better (for hair washing).\nToiletries provided were a shower gel, a shampoo and body cream. Also provided a hair dryer that worked really well and much more powerful than the usual hotel offerings.\nThe hotel as a whole was very clean and the staff were lovely! We were super impressed with the receptionist who we saw speak in French, English, Spanish and Italian with great ease.\nThe breakfast buffet was plentiful and very tasty with a selection of pastries, eggs, bacon, meats, toast, cereals, yogurts, and even vegan and gluten free choices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:37:00.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
