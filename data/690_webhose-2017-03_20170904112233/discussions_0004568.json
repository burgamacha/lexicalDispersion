I go to New York City on business numerous times each year, and I must say, I have finally found my regular \"go to\" place for each of my stays. They have this unique \"library\" theme (How convenient, right across the street from a Starbucks!) Even got to pick out a free advanced copy of a book at check in. The hotel provided a \"Reading Room\" to enjoy the book in, and even better, a 'Wine and Cheese Reception\" which gave me something to snack on with the book. Amazing! A great breakfast was also offered in the morning as well. If all of that was not enough, there is this amazing Roof Top bar, which is also something to behold. Of course, the staff there is top notch, very helpful and super friendly, and the room was terrific. I can't wait to return and I urge other visitors to New York City to also try this amazing and unique place to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:35:01.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
