I booked the hotel at last minute since my boyfriend and I were going to do some fun things in Times Square and there were no problems getting a reservation. It was a little pricey this time however. Last year we booked 2 nights around the same time and the 2 nights were almost less expensive as opposed to this one night stay. Moving on, we arrived around 5:30 pm after parking our car not even 100 feet away in an over night parking garage. The staff was very welcoming as I remembered. The check-in/out process is super easy since it is done by computer. However, on the questionnaire for the check in, the hotel asked for our preference for where we'd like to be in the hotel and we said a higher floor and we were put on the 4th floor - this is my only complaint. The room was ready right away as expected. The hotel was not noisy at all and we both got a good night of sleep - which is often tricky to find in an NYC hotel. Overall, the stay was great and the location is super convenient since it is located in Times Square - there was minimal travel by bus, car, subway and etc. since we stayed mostly in the Times Square area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:17:43.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
