The property enjoys an excellent location, with many choices for dining nearby. Did not see if there was a subway line nearby as it was a comfortable walk to the places I wanted to be. I loved the Grand Bar, the ambience, the old New York feel up to the minimal details. The service was excellent and consistent throughout. Now, although I like dim lighting and the vibe it creates, I found that it was too dark, but did not bother me. Although the first floor lobby and elevators seem dated. Liked the room and the classy feel, but especially liked the bathroom, with great lighting, very clean and all white. The bar and room amenities were fully stocked and you find anything you may need (at a price of course). Overall, would consider staying at the property again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:00:54.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
