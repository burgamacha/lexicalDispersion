This hotel is conveniently located 2 blocks away in a beautiful neighbourhood. The hotel features the first champagne bar in Paris in its original setting. The rooms were gorgeous and well presented. The staff topnotch. I was a little leary of the original elevator as the doors were unpredictable. However, it is done in the style of a Louis Vitton Steamer Trunk and complimented the original features of the hotel. Highly recommend, even for a longer stay as you can easily access the hop and go boat along the Seine.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have wonderful views with french balconies.
