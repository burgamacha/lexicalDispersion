My soon to be wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December 2015. It was the perfect proposal location. The staff were amazing from start to finish. Always welcoming and polite, nothing was too much to ask. Our suite was without a doubt the best hotel room I've ever stayed in. Amazing quality furnishings, technology and accessories.\nAfter some champagne to get my courage up and then more to celebrate we made the most of the Raid the Pantry enjoying the fantastic range of snacks and treats. The following morning we were greeted and congratulated by more staff before enjoying a delicious breakfast.\nWhen the wedding is done and the honeymoon enjoyed we will definitely be back to Hotel 41, mybe for our 1 year Wedding Anniversary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:52:59.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
