There was plenty of space, and the room was laid out so it felt spacious. The bathroom had both a bathtub and a separate shower. There was a unique sliding \"wall\" between the tub and living space so that you could open it and view the TV from the tub. The art in the room was beautiful and peaceful. Most staff spoke English well enough that we could mostly understand each other. They had an electrical converter I borrowed so that I could recharge my phone and computer. There was a restaurant in the hotel that served Chinese dishes at moderate prices. My company also hosted a meeting in this hotel. The meeting space worked very well and the staff worked hard setting up the room overnight. I would stay at this hotel again if I ever get a chance to return to Beijing.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:22:27.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
