Maybe trip advisor could setup a way of searching for place that are open on a Monday or just open on a particular day. It would have saved us some time.\nWe were not disappointed. Great service, great coffee, great setting and great food. And the best part is that there is a wine tasting hall right there with, wait for it, great wines.\nWe got there a little late so the grounds staff were busy cutting the lawn which was a little loud but they have to do it sometime. So I would suggest getting there at a normal breakfast time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:13:11.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
