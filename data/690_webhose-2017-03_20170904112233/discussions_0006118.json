The hotel is only a block or so from Times Square, so you are right in the heart of the action. It was a 15 minute walk to the Intrepid Museum, which I enjoyed immensely. We had 4 adults with cruise luggage in a double room and there was enough space. Our room was on a back corner and one window looked towards the docks, so we were able to see our ship arrive.\nI had no issues with service. Check-in was quick and friendly and the room was well cleaned.\nIf I was to offer one suggestion to the Hotel, it would be to clean up the grout and caulking in the bathroom. Everything was immaculate except for that, but it's something your eye is drawn to, and leaves a poorer impression than the room deserves. Even so I gave it 5 stars and would stay again!\nRoom Tip: Our room was on a corner, away from Times Square. One window looked back towards the river.
