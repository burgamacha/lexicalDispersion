Its level of cleanliness is very impressive as the rooms are fresh and comfortable. The room offered extra conveniences with its kitchenette (refrigerator, microwave, cooktop). This made it possible to store and prepare groceries. The bathroom toiletries are also very pleasant. It is a peaceful environment and it is very close to gorgeous gardens if one is looking for tranquility. The hotel representatives at the front desk are charming, attentive, and helpful. It is the perfect place to return after a day of walking, shopping, and exploring. Definitely looking forward to visiting The Westbourne again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:52:27.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
