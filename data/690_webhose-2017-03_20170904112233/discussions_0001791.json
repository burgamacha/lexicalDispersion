Great location and plenty of nice little places to eat around as well. Literally 5 minutes from the RER B line, and we found it to not be a busy stop which made the luggage situation easier. Very cute lobby with a working fireplace, so cozy. Our room was a bit larger than the other place we stayed in Paris, and had very lovely wood beams on the ceiling and a small shared terrace. It was so nice and lovely! I'll consider this place again for a longer stay if I return to Paris!\nRoom Tip: Room 12 had a terrace See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:18:17.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
