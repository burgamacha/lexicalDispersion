Check-in was quick and efficient. Receptionist on duty was very friendly and informative.\nWe got a twin room which was lovely, clean and it had plenty of space for two. All staff were polite and friendly, hotel WiFi worked perfectly and the breakfast every morning was superb.\nHotel located in an ideal spot in London, very close to The Olympia, Kensington High Street and travel services such as the overground and bus stops.\nI would definitely stay here again, and I would recommend it to other people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:50:54.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
