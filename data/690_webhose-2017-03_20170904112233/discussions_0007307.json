Your staff was very friendly and helpful, I mentioned we were traveling for my fiance's birthday and a few minutes after we were settled in our room a beautiful dessert plate was sent. The remodeled rooms are clean and very spacious; we had an amazing view of the London Eye right outside of our room window! I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family traveling to London.
