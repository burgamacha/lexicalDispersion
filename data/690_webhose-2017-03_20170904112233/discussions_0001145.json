The hotel is very trendy with fantastic art and beautiful comfortable surroundings. The waiters were the best I have experienced in a hotel. Phil needs to be remunerated well as he is a first class supervisor/waiter. He commands the restaurant and politely organises his staff. Well what can I say about the food -superb!!!! The portions aren't small but nice and filling. The Sunday roast was to die for. Then we went into the screening room which is a perfect size and lots of room. The extra treat of free bottled water and popcorn was a lovely touch. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!!! Well done Firmdale - I have been to the Ham Yard and this hotel -restaurant is just as good. You have great vision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:22:07.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
