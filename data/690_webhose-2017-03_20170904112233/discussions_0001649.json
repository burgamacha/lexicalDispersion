We loved everything about this inn-style hotel. The staff and owner, Susan, were absolutely outstanding and gave us excellent advice for every question we had. The hotel is in the best possible location; on \"Restaurant Row\" in Hell's Kitchen, a few blocks from Broadway theaters and Times Square. Subways were close by. An absolute highlight was the daily Happy Hour gathering of guests. We met other Canadians, people from all over the States, and many U.K. and European guests. It was a melting pot of wonderful people who shared their daily travel experiences and excitement of the City. We can't say enough great things about this small hotel experience and the incredibly caring staff who look after the guests so amazingly! We'll be back!! Doug and Ann\nRoom Tip: We had a room overlooking the courtyard and did not hear any noise at all, day or night See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:19:07.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
