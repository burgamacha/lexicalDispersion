Hotel Atmospheres is everything they advertise to be. We stayed 8 nights and received outstanding service throughout our stay. The staff at the front desk speaks excellent English and were very kind and helpful with all our questions and issues. Our room was very modern and clean, Breakfast was well presented and provided us with a healthy start to our day. It was well worth whatever extra we paid. Also, it's a great location if you are looking for a place on the Left Bank. All the above from a retired couple, watching our wallet but desiring some comforts and hoping for a memorable trip without any 'surprises'.\nRoom Tip: If street noise bothers you.... ask to be placed off the courtyard.
