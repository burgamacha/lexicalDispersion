Beside us getting the reservation at the last minute there was not a problem to get to our room in less than 10 min.\nWe walked there from the Eiffel Tower and walked around to visit some restaurants in the neighborhood. The room was cozy with large window balcony where you can appreciate the beauty of the streets of Paris. I Definitely recommend it and will be back to this hotel on our next travel to Paris.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:21:55.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
