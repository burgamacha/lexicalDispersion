We had a corner room which had nice d√©cor and was very clean. Had a pleasant view up the boulevard.The room had a minibar fridge and snacks, and a coffee making machine, although the coffee was not quite hot enough. The bed was very comfortable. The location is perfect. A short walk (10 min) to the Opera, Place del la Concorde, and Lafayette shops. Also, high end shopping e.g. Chanel and Gucci on the doorstep. The Madeleine metro stop is about 60 metres away. The impressive Madeleine church is even closer. There is a Franprix food store very close by too, for any necessities or if you don't want to use the minibar. Some very good restaurants and breakfast bars within 100 metres. We walked to the Louvre and Notre Dame, and took the metro to the Eiffel Tower. Would recommend using the Big Bus Tour (or similar), a great way to get to know the city. Get a 2 day pass, as 2nd day is only $5 more. Use day 1 for the tours (Classic and Montmartre), and use the 2nd day as a Taxi. We also bought a Zone 1 & 2 10-pack metro ticket giving us 5 ride options. If you buy a Museum Pass that includes the cost to go up the Notre Dame Bell towers, so can save you some money gthere. It is hard work though as is going up the Arc de Triomphe, but would recommend doing both if you can. We had a great trip.\nMerci, au revoir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:19:36.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
