We called a few days before our arrival and asked for a good view. We were in room 1029 which was an excellent view facing 48th near toward Time Square. The double queen room was spacious and very clean. The bell staff was very attentive and friendly in addition to the front desk. We would highly recommend this hotel to any family visiting NYC. It is within walking distance to almost everywhere. Plus the subway is very close as well. We will be returning to NYC one day, and we will be staying at this hotel again.\nRoom Tip: Call a few days in advance and mention it again at check in See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:44:48.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
