We had a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower from our room on the 5th floor and it was lovely to wake up to the view every morning and seeing the Eiffel Tower lit up in the evenings. The Front Office Manager, Raphael, was extremely kind and helpful when booking the room on the phone (it is cheaper to book with the hotel directly than booking sites) and when we arrived. We were very pleased to find that our room was ready at 10.30 in the morning, and we could stay until midday on the day we left. The manager even arranged a bottle of champagne to be delivered to our room to celebrate my husband's birthday. Such a lovely surprise....thank you so much.\nThe hotel is located in a very nice area and only a walk away from The Eiffel Tower, the Seine river and many excellent restaurants and bars. We really enjoyed walking to the restaurants rather than relying on the metro all the time, although the metro is next to the hotel which is very convenient to explore further afield.\nWe will definitely be returning!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:46:59.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
