From the location, beautiful entrance, amazingly interesting corridors with lots of historical photos etc. to the immaculate bedding and charming courtyard, this is just fabulous. Staff were so engaging and polite. So glad we didn't opt for one of the downtown hotels, I don't think we would have ventured into the area but so glad we did. Even the people in the neighbourhood were so friendly and smiled and greeted us every day. Rooms are beautiful with lovely authentic feel. Breakfast great some interesting choices for western taste but fascinating. Can't go wrong with fruit, toasted and eggs but you need to try some of the huge buffet breakfast. Love love loved every second of being there.\nRoom Tip: If going to Beijing you really should go here.
