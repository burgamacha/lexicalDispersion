What a pleasant stay. Staff was friendly, rooms were comfortable, banquet facilities were suitable.\nLocation was convenient to the metro and several local eateries.\nIf I had to complain, it would be about the HVAC and the fitness center. No matter what I did I couldn't get the temperature in the room to a good level. Had to sleep with the window open, and when you're on the street side it's a little noisy.\nThe fitness center is way to small for a hotel this size. It is nice, just small.\nThanks for the hospitality!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:42:33.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
