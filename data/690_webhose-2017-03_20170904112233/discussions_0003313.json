From the moment we arrived and the delightful Helene took us to our room, to the bell boy who flagged down a taxi when we left, it was a lovely experience. Our room, though on the small side, was perfectly formed, well designed and incredibly quiet. It was on the 4th floor overlooking Rue de Rivoli and had double French doors (good for soundproofing on a busy street) to a small balcony which meant the obligatory photo opportunities of the Louvre across the street, the Eiffel Tower and the Tuileries. Breakfast was part of the online deal and was fresh, tasty and substantial. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris. Wonderful.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room overlooking Rue de Rivoli or Rue des Pyramides (and grab earplugs) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:27:57.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
