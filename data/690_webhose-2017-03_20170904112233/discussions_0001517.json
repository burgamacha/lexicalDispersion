Lots of restaurant opportunities within minutes of the hotel. The room was clean while the space between the footboard of bed and the desk is very tight making use of the desk challenging. The bed is very comfortable and the adjacent spacy bathroom with large shower cabin is wonderful. The breakfast is more than adequate (when the cook shows up - was missing one morning). The bar/lounge is a great place to hang out in the evening for a coffee or a drink with something sweet on the side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:43.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
