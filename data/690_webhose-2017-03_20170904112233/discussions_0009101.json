It is 100 meters to Euston station with good tube and bus connections. The hotel has recently been refurbished, but looks like most of the money were spent in the lobby. Rooms were average (clean!) and good water pressure. We should be able to open the windows 10 cm more as we wanted more fresh air.\nThe check-in process is too hip for me. People walking around with small cellphone which checks you in. This is 5 meters after entering the hotel so if a lot of people want to check in at the same time there will be a queue almost when entering the hotel. This should be changed. Paid for late check-out (a nice feature), but this was not shown when checking in, but were fixed promptly. Breakfast was ok with lots to select from. There are several nice pubs in the area.\nRoom Tip: Room away from street See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:32:51.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
