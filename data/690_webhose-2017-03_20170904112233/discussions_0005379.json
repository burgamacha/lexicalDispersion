Julian in the front desk was just amazing. He was so helpful. Can't say enough about how wonderful all the staff is at this hotel. The corner suite we stayed in was very comfortable for us 3. We had a great time here. Its very close to the shops and restaurants in Bercy Village. Metro Station is close by. 10 - 15 min by Metro to most of Paris main attractions.
