Not necessarily from the outside where it looks like a stylish city boutique modern hotel but for the staff. Haven't been anywhere for a while where they have made you so welcome and looked after us so well. We had used their chauffeur option but our flight came in 40mins early so we expected to wait BUT the driver was there waiting!! Very impressed with that level of service. Reception staff were friendly, courteous, proficient and spoke way better English than our (poor) Italian! They helped us make reservations at restaurants; choices on where to visit, how to visit i.e. Walk, taxi, bus etc and nothing was too much trouble.\nThe rooms are stylish and functional, tasteful and have inclusive extras like free mini bar, tea coffee facilities plus biscuits & snacks. No view from our room (422) but we weren't there much so it didn't bother us. It was quiet and comfortable. The bathroom is compact but again stylish, pretty and functional with free toiletries. Breakfast was included with our room and there was an extensive choice plus if you couldn't see something you wanted, you could ask for what you wanted & they would try hard to facilitate you.\nWe thought the staff were tremendous & made our stay extra special. We can't wait to go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:56:15.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
