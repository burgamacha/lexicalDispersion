Our room was lovely, and the bed comfy. We were disappointed to only have 1 chair which meant that someone had to sit on the bed but this is didn't matter too much.\nThe bathroom was very luxurious. It had a Jacuzzi bath which we don't have at home so it was a great treat.\nBreakfast was exceptional; it was delicious and the variety of food on offer was the best we've had at any hotel we've stayed at. The home made cakes and yoghurt are not to be missed!\nAll the staff were very kind and very helpful.\nThe ,location is great, very close to friendly restaurants selling lovely food. It is very close to the Spanish steps which has a lovely atmosphere both during the day and at night.\nWe will remember our stay at the Manfredi with fondness and can't wait to go back.\nRoom Tip: Not much of a view from our room but we didn't mind that.
