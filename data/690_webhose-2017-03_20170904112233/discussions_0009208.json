The design it's very unusual and makes you literally feel like you r in a dream. Each room is decorated in different theme. I stayed once in (although small) room on fifth floor with bathtub being in the middle of the room with then had direct views to the flickering Eiffel Tower... dream!! :) Other times I stayed in quiet large rooms decorated in white leather and sparkly stones where all lights looked like jelly fish hanging from the ceiling and they were all changing rainbows of colours....very satisfying to your creative senses!! :) management and staff is absolutely superb. Breakfast is also good. Location is good as it has many restaurants around with one of my favourite in the whole of Paris in particular!! Great stay, will be back one day :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:46:36.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
