It's fairly unassuming from the outside but the room we had was spacious, well-equipped and ridiculously clean. The bathroom was very small but immaculate, and actually had a bath, (which was lovely after hours of walking up and down the cobbled hills!) and a really powerful shower. The toiletries provided were better than one usually finds in hotels. Although our front window overlooked only a tiny street, it did get rather noisy on the Tuesday morning (about 5am), when the noisiest binmen in the world seemed to be juggling a million bottles, but apart from this, it was surprisingly quiet. There was NO noise at all from other rooms within the hotel, which, in our experience, is very unusual indeed. The man at reception was extremely helpful and couldn't have been more helpful. The downstairs (down a spiral staircase, underground) dining room was where we were able to get coffees and cold drinks and light snacks (all free of charge) from 3-11pm. We only had breakfast (buffet) once at the hotel, on the final day, and this was simple but lovely. We would definitely stay here again! Top tip: if staying and unsure how to get here from the airport, buy a 1.80Euro RER/Metro ticket (valid for both RER trains and Metro trains) and you can get the RER train from the airport to Gare du Nord, then the Metro to Pigalle (one change) on the same ticket! We made the mistake of paying 50 Euros to get to the hotel by taxi but got back to the airport on our way home for 1.80 each.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:03:31.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
