I think this is more than reasonable price for what it is. The receptionist welcomed us with a smile, explained everything, including what time is the breakfast. We came to our room, everything was clean, bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was quite simple; croissants, cereals, yogurts & full English breakfast, you could also chose gluten free and soya milk if you are on a special diet. We went for a walk around London, and didn't have to use the underground at all because of the location of the hotel. Overall, it is not a Ritz but if you want to stay in the city centre and not feeling guilty of spending too much money but still indulge yourself with a clean and nice hotel, go for this one. I'd also recommend to sign up for their membership, so you can collect points and get better prices than on booking.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:51:26.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
