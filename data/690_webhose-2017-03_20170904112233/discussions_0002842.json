Anne, Victor and Christophe are absolutely superb, always smilling and going a step beyong what is expected.\nI am really looking forward to seeing the new restaurant and the new lobby and have also been told that the rooms will get refreshed soon.\nRoom Tip: Some rooms on the 5th floor have small balconies.
