When we first arrived we were greeted by a very kind lady who informed us that we had been upgraded to a deluxe double room and although we were early, the room was all ready and waiting for us. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfy. It didn't stop there.. when we got back to the hotel room in the evening the staff had very kindly left a bottle of white wine and 2 glasses in the room for us, to help us celebrate my partners birthday. Everyone at the hotel was very polite and really went out their way to make sure our stay was one to remember. I would like to thank the Grosvenor Hotel for giving myself and my partners the most wonderful experience. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay here, we will definitely be returning!.\nThe location: 5* The hotel is located right next door to Victoria station.\nThe staff: 5* Absolutely fantastic.\nThe room: 5* The deluxe double was spacious, very clean, large bathroom and had a wonderfully comfy bed.\nThe hotel: 5* The hotel smelt divine and was beautifully decorated.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:36:48.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
