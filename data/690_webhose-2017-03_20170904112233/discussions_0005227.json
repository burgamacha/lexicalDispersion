Confused I went to the front desk to speak to the Manager. What a pleasure! Kevin contacted my travel agent back in South Africa and sorted the whole thing out for me. He also offered to pay for day 1 if the agents could not resolve the problem.\nHats off to the staff. Each and every one of them went the extra mile to make my stay pleasurable. From great advice on what to do, again Kevin, and helping get car transfers and safe boxes.\nI will definitely stay again when in NYC. Conveniently located near major underground stations. Lower manhattan is not as congested us mid and upper. Quicker to the airport. Hotel looks out over the 9/11 memorial, so has a special place in my thoughts.\nGive them a try! Comfortable rooms. Free chilled still and sparkling water, all round great deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:36:53.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
