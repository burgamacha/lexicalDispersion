The room is nice and big and we got an amazing rate (all due to timing and me constantly checking back) so those are 2 huge bonuses. It is clean and nice having a kitchen. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and it is so close to the subway so that's super convenient. The bed is very hard and not super comfortable, our son slept on the convertible couch bed and as most couch beds are, that was not comfortable either but for him it was fine. We asked for extra blankets and also checking the blankets on the bed we ended up with 2 of those ruffle/mattress covers things. You know, the thing you put on your boxspring and then your mattress over it and the panels hang down to cover the boxspring and the open space? Yea, odd right? That's what they gave us for \"blankets.\" Different but whatever.\nAlso, not sure if some of the employees live there or what's going on....when we asked for extra blankets the employee that delivered them to our room actually went into another room on the floor and my husband saw a woman inside there....so not sure what that's all about. Just kinda interesting....\nThe breakfast is pretty good, esp if you don't have any food allergies/intolerances. Pastries, coffee, juice, loose fruit, cold cereal, yogurt, waffle maker and pre-packaged breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal. My son and I could only have the oatmeal, but that's fine.\nSo overall, it was a great stay but we can't go back cuz my husband can't sleep on the bed. ;(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:28:01.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
