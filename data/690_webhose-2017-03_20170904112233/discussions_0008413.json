However, when I asked reception if we could be moved to a room facing away from the street for our second night, they could not have been more helpful. Not only did they not quibble about moving us, they upgraded us to one of their newly refurbished rooms on the sixth floor, facing the carpark (with a partial view of the Gherkin!) where it was dead quiet at night, and I was able to sleep much better. We had a slight problem ordering room service and this was also resolved extremely satisfactorily. I often think in the UK that we don't know how to do good customer service, but I was so impressed by all the staff at this hotel, they were extremely professional, friendly and courteous towards us. So my only criticism of the hotel is that they need to improve the soundproofing of the windows in the rooms facing the main street.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room facing either the carpark or the side street.
