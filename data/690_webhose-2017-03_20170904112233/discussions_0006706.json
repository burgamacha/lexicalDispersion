The staff always welcomes you and take good care of you, giving you the best service. The elevators are as you mostly find them in Paris, small, but the rooms are clean, well kept, and charming, just as the rest of the hotel. The rooms are air conditioned. Barhrooms are nice, and modern. You find very good cafes and bars very close. You also find yourself close to the metro - just go down to it through the warehouse Bazar Hotel de Ville, or grab a taxi at the big square Hotel de Ville. The island with Notre Dame is just a short walk away, and there are aslo all the good shops just around the corners. This is not a tourist trap, even though you might think it is. I mean - after all it is Paris. You should really have a good time in Paris if you stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:35:26.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
