However first impressions can be deceptive and actually what we found over 5 nights was that we had a perfectly functional space with which to base ourselves for our New York Christmas adventure!!\nThe room was clean and tidy with a sort of modern industrial styling. The main part of the room was separated from the toilet / shower room by a sliding frosted glass door. This was really the main controversial design choice as not everybody will feel too happy about literally seeing their other half through the door whilst using the toilet situated only a few feet away from the bed! This could be a deal breaker if you're not that familiar with your roommate. Suffice to say you'll become VERY close friends after visiting here!\nAway from the room there is Salvation Taco, a Mexican small plates restaurant with bar just through the lobby. There is also apparently a roof bar but we didn't see this due to the time of year. Salvation Taco had a really cool look and feel, perhaps slightly pretentious and highly priced but we had some good drinks and amazing tacos from there!\nThe lobby staff along with the staff in the bar / restaurant were really helpful and professional and we also got a superb recommendation from the concierge on a place to get a bagel that was just around the corner (Zuckers).\nOnly complaint is the noisy air-con, bring earplugs if you sleep lightly.\nIn summary if you are coming to New York with a view to getting some kind of Sex and the City luxury and glamour this may not be for you. However if like us (couple in our 30's) you need a well situated, functional, well priced, clean and tidy place to stay whilst you explore this awesome city then you could do an awful lot worse! We would definitely recommend Pod 39.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:07:17.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
