The location is excellent - accessible to all things on the left bank and near to the Metro lots of small restaurants and watering holes, and interesting individual shops. The hotel was a nicely done up boutique hotel and the staff were charming, helpful and efficient. Room was good, though (and this is the main criticism) cramped and the beds in the classic rooms too small for tall, large people - but this is true of many Parisian hotels. The breakfast, (served in a charming small room overlooking the courtyard), which was included in our deal was good and varied and a pleasant change from the ghastly buffets of the big chains. We would definitely visit again.\nRoom Tip: If you are on the taller side ask for a suite or a better room as rooms and beds are rather small See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:04:02.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
