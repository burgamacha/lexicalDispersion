Great room, very clean, comfy and unusually decorated. Only downside was front facing and a little noisy for us country bumpkins. Not bad sleep though, mainly due to very comfy bed. Breakfast adequate but not great. Would have liked better choice of fresh fruit and a better selection of cold meat, some of which ran out long before the end of breakfast service.\nStaff very good and pleasant, very helpful.\nLocation perfect, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and so close to the south bank. Loads of facilities and restaurants nearby, including Borough Market.\nWill most certainly be back soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:46:05.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
