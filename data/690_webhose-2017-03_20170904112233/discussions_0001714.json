My husband surprised me with a stay there during my Birthday weekend and I received a lovely welcome from their staff. They really made our stay very enjoyable and you can see their attention to detail and great customer service throughout.\nI absolutely loved the hotel's character as you can still admire the building's traditional heritage combined with a very contemporary design and technology.\nOur room was beautiful and very spacious which was a lovely surprise considering usual central London room sizes. Their complimentary mini bar and use of in-room gadgets was also very impressive.\nThis is one of those hotels I would definitely recommend when traveling to London for business as well as leisure. Amba Charing Cross hotel and its staff certainly exceeded my expectations on this occasion and made my future central London hotel choice much easier.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:09:50.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
