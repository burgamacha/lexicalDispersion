I stayed for 5 days in a king size bed in single room and it was one of the best hotel experiences I had. The room was so warm and quiet, elegant and clean. Very big space to fit luggage, working desk, it had all the equipment to make a quick meal: microwave, mini-bar, dishes and plates, wine opener and wine glasses and coffee machine. The hotel is in a nice location in mid-town Manhattan although a bit of a walk to the subway but close enough to many great restaurants and shops.\nI would totally recommend it for any purpose of traveling.\nRoom Tip: best to have a room with a city view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:04:16.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
