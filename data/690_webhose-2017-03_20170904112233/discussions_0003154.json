This hotel was great. Staff is chill and helpful and the hotel is what you need: clean bathroom and a bed. Close to 7th and 8th Ave metros and right next door to a (slightly overpriced) but delicious healthy food grab n go food market/coffee shop/restaurant. I never felt unsafe staying here and the hotel is small enough that staff is attentive to any needs that might arise. Don't hesitate and book here if you are wanting to stay in Chelsea.\nRoom Tip: They have bathrobes!
