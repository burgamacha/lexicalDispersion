We were escorted to our room and once again welcomed to the hotel. Needing to go to a wedding, we requested an iron and ironing board which was there within 5 minutes of requesting, amazing! The room itself was flawlessly set up for us and had a little bacony which overlooked the pool area. Super friendly staff, exceptional setting and a very well laid out breakfast. Allround the stay was a great pleasure and would definately make us go back there again. Thank you!
