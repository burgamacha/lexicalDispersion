Organising transport from Heathrow to birthday breakfast - nothing was a problem. The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to most central London attractions. Modern with beautiful rooms and an amazing rooftop radio bar. Will def be back and recommend anyone staying in London to book this hotel - it's hard if not impossible to beat the welcome and service here !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:12:12.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
