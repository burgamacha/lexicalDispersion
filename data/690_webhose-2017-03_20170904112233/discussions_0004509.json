It has a unique homely feel and the staff were attentive and friendly. It's fantastic value for money with a great breakfast. Location is perfect for the metro for all the sight seeing and a 5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower.\nExtremely comfortable bed and we did not find the room to small as many other hotel reviews complain about.\nI will definitely be recommending this hotel to my friends!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:40:22.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
