We loved the Art Deco theme throughout the entire place! Although not normally my choice in decor, it was so tastefully done, We fell in love with it. The hotel was clean, comfy, and staffed by knowledgeable, friendly people. What more could you ask for; oh, I know, an affordable rate. They were running a special for the weekend, and we just stumbled upon it! Amazing. The location was also terrific. We were able to walk (though a bit long for anyone with health issues) to Times Square and just take it all in. I just couldn't say one bad thing about our stay here. Book it.
