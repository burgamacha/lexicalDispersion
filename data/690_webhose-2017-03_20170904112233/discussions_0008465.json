There are numerous restaurants and cafes to choose from. St. Catherine Square just around the corner has a good choice, as well as the nearby streets. The hotel itself is going through an upgrade of facilities but is being done without too much disruption, other than currently in the breakfast room. There was the choice of dining in the reception area or your own room. Because of this the owners kindly did not charge for the meal. The room we had was on the second floor and ideal for our requirements. The room was clean, large bathroom, usual facilities you would expect from a 3 Star Hotel. Service was second to none, the recepition personnel were always very helpful. This is the second time we've stayed here in five years and would certainly return next time we are in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:25:29.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
