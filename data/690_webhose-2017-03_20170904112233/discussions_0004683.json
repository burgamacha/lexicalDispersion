We had asked for a late check out because of this late flight. David Cirincione was the one who assisted us. He not only gave us a generous late check out, he was happy to accommodate us with this request. Because of him, we had a place to leave our things safely without having to carry it around with us all day as we explored the city, and it gave us a place to come back and freshen up at before leaving to the airport. Thank you David for helping us out, and making the travel experience so much easier!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:19:44.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
