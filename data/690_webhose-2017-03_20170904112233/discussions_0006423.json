It is ideally located when travelling in from the west, previously offering a more traditional dinner service in it's City Cafe restaurant the hotel now provides a good range of bar meals. Alternatively Trafalgar Square and the West End are within easy reach. Some rooms give a view of the Thames, all are functional for a 2 or 3 night stay, for longer stays, storage space maybe an issue. An extensive buffet style breakfast is available if required. For us, the location is key, the hotel is ideally located for a weekend break in London, Westminster tube station is within a 5 minute walk, or simply explore on foot.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors provide better views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:05:01.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
