Room and facilities nice.. Cleaners very helpful and foyer a relaxed place to meet friends or just chill out. Gym on the 5th floor small but good. Didn't try roof top bar as it was snowing outside and very cold. The vino restaurant is very passable, but couldn't say the same for the other on site eatery (l'Amico) which was not good at all. Reception staff very amenable, but the star is the doorman (Alex), who helped us find the best places to shop and eat and gave us lots of practical advise. He went out of his way to make our stay nice. One comment, it would be nice to have a kettle in the room and failing that at least serve hot coffee in the bar. I had to ask three mornings on the trot for the barman to heat the coffee up for me ..! Strange? Overall though a nice laid back hotel in this very busy area. We have no hesitation in recommending it to other potential customers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:43:32.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
