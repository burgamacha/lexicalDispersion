Hotel located quick nicely and within walking distance to Montmartre and Galeries Lafayette and also very close to metro station. Room was very very good, little bit on small size but it is quite normal for Paris. Room was very modern and had all required amenities include safe box in the room.\nHowever, what is putting this hotel aside is customer service. Hotel front desk was absolutely amazing and extremely friendly, accommodation every single need we had during our stay.\nCan't recommend it enough and we will definitely will be staying in this hotel during our future trips to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:59:06.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
