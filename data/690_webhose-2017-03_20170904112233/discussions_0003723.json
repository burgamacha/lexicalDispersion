We arrived at the hotel from CDG at 10am and our room was already ready for us! It was so nice to have a place to take a nice shower after the long flight! Enrique at the reception was very welcoming with a wonderful smile! The room was clean and was a nice size.\nI liked the location, being next to Rue St Honore, 15mins walk to the Louvre and 5mins walk to Galeries Lafayette. We either walked, or took a Uber to and from the places we visited. Uber to wherever we went was always under 10Euros, given the central location of the hotel.\nThe service at the hotel was great! All the staff were very polite and helpful. Even heart warming enough to remind us to bring an umbrella with forecast of rain in the afternoon. Thanks for taking care of us!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:55:09.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
