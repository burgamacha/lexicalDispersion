A mere 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and approx. 20-30 minutes away (via metro) from such landmarks as the Louvre and Notre Dame cathedral. We received a warm welcome on arrival and throughout our stay all staff were pleasant and were willing to converse in English, even helping us with our attempts at the French language. The staff were happy to assist us with additional services, such as when we asked them to arrange a taxi one evening. The room itself was ready on arrival and was more than suitable for our needs. The facilities in the room were of a good standard for a 3 star hotel and it was clean and comfortable, the linen and towels were changed daily. We can't comment regarding breakfast as there are so many restaurants and bistros in the locale that we decided to try a different one each day. To summarise we would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again when we return to Paris. Thank you for making us feel so welcome and look forward to seeing you again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:57:35.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
