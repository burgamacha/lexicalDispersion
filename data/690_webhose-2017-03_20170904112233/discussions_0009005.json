We arrived earlier than regular check in and they had a room all ready (wasn't the 9th fl we wanted but we were so early). A new staff member was in training but she did a fine job helped by senior staff. A very modern hotel compared to many in London. The room was large enough and the replenished bottled water was a nice treat. ( Remember that you should mention if you want still water or sparkling water.) There was always a taxi out in front if you needed one but we chose many times to walk to attractions. Many travelers find this an ideal locations because of some corporate and government buildings nearby. It's a little farther to some but the area was very secure and there was a Pret nearby and other places to eat if you didn't want to use the hotel restaurant and bar. One of the nights we had the fire alarm go off and the entire hotel had to evacuate the building using the stairs only. The fire doors closed so we knew something was going on. Tried to call down but no help-maybe they could get some kind of robo call to alert us. Because it was a little cold out , they passed out emergency blankets if you needed one. After it seemed safer, they explained we'd have to wait until the fireman had checked the entire building to re-enter. Finally we could move into the lobby for warmth and then we were OK'ed to re-enter. The staff was efficient but it was hard to hear the instructions she was trying to give. We received a letter from the manager under our door later about the fire alarm. Check out was simple; I used Express Check Out. Always felt the warmth of the friendly service and availablitiy to obtain another warm choc. chip cookie! It seems that the price made worthwhile. Thank you to all the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:32.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
