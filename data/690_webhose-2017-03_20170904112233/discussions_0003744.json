Unfortunately an upgrade wasn't offered as suggested by other travellers and I wasn't made aware of the deposit you had to make at the time of check in in addition to the prepayment but apart from that the service was amazing! Being newly pregnant I wanted a nice relaxing holiday and that was what I got, the staff were friendly and extremely attentive and were happy to answer any questions I had throughout my stay. The rooftop bar is beautiful (although construction is currently being done so that restricted our views) and the breakfast buffet was nice, although there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby to try something different. The restaurant attached to the hotel has a very good pizza deal and nice breakfast too. The main advantage to this hotel is the location. Apart from booking cars to/from the airport we didn't have to step foot on any public transport at all as everything you could ever want to see is so conveniently close! If I can walk to and from Vatican City (the furthest attraction away) whilst pregnant anyone can! Overall I had an amazing time at this hotel and hope to return in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:03:41.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
