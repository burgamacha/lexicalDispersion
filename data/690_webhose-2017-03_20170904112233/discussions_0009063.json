On arriving the reception team could not have been friendlier. Felt really welcome. There was a treat for us in the room and the room was a lovely size. Unfortunately the bathroom and breakfast let it down a bit which i have since spoken to the hotel about and received a very nice response. The location was brilliant for gloucester road tube, restaurants and museums. I felt the hotel was a bit overpriced but i would stay again due to location and amazing staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:39:27.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
