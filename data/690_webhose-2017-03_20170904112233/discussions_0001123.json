I have never been impressed so much that I felt compelled to leave a review until I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beijing. It was great the first time I stayed but I thought maybe it was it was just my lucky day, but after the 3rd time, I realize that indeed their service is top notch and consistently so. In fact, I have stayed at their sister property in Shanghai over 50 times in the past 3 years and Beijing is hands down better than Shanghai in all aspects except size of the rooms, which are bigger in Shanghai but everything else, from the bottled water to the welcome snacks to staff's attentiveness/responsiveness to the overall design and the breakfast, the Beijing property is better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:20:27.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
