Just checked in...staff is very patient and accommodating. Hotel is located right in the midst of all the center of all the action. It's no more than a 25 minute stroll to most sights, eatery, shopping, ect. The hotel itself, the second you walk in you are greeted with a chic but modern decor. Our room was modern and the layout is great. 2 climate zones, clean and comfortable. 4th floor with 2 balconies. What a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:18:55.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
