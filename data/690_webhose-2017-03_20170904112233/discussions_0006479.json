My second stay was equally wonderful on all counts. Enough cannot be said about the helpfulness of the staff and the friendliness of the welcome. Having had such extraordinary service last year, it was truly astounding to find new members of staff with the same exceptional courtesy and hospitality.\nThe room itself was precisely what I'd requested: a small, cosy room on the first floor. The bed in the room was comfortable, and the room and en suite shower room were immaculate. The complimentary toiletries smelled delightful as well. The shower was new compared to my stay last year. The water temperature and pressure were wonderful. There is a thermostat in the room and I was able to adjust the temperature to precisely my comfort level. I stayed two nights and the room was so lovely, I was sorry to have to depart.\nThe location around the corner from Earls Court (on three lines:Piccadilly, District, and Circle) is fantastic. The area around the station is vibrant and convenient, with a Boots, a Paul, cash points, and all manner of shops, restaurants, and pubs.\nFor me, the real joy in staying at the Nadler Kensington is the incredible staff, but the wonderful rooms and terrific location are nearly as good.\nRoom Tip: My requests have been accommodated. Simply ask for what you want. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:10:20.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
