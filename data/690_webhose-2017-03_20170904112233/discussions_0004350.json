I had a standard double and it was charming and very clean. This hotel is not cookie cutter and I loved the fun wallpaper. There is a metro station very close to the hotel and a taxi stand. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I had a street side room on the 6th floor and it was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was big and with great water flow. I will stay here again next time I am in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:00:31.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
