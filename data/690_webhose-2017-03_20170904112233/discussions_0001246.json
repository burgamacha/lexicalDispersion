Our experience with the hotel was great. It was beyond our expectations. First and the most important thing about the hotel is that the staff were always helpful and nice. Thanks again for their awesome service. Location of the hotel was really great and it was exceedingly sufficient for our trip plans. There are nearby metro & train stations and shops. Madeleine metro station is only 100 meters away. The room was very clean and stylish. It was also surprisingly spacious considering it is a Paris hotel. Bed was comfortable even if pillows are a little bit small. Bathroom was very clean, also. We would love to stay again in HÃ´tel du Triangle d'Or for another Paris trip. Overall the hotel is definitely worth the price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:41:06.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
