The staff on reception were attentive. Our room was not ready at 1.30pm so she let us change/shower in the gym downstairs. It was ready when we arrived back upstairs at 2pm so we were able to leave our bags in there before heading straight out.\nThe room was spacious enough but I had paid $15 per night the day before to upgrade after they sent through an email. I'm not sure however if we got a better room or not for that price.\nDid find the room very warm but the air conditioning was pretty noisy and we couldn't sleep with it. Also the following morning I used the coffee machine and it was so noisy that I didn't even attempt it again. The towels were not the best either, looking a bit tired.\nWhen we arrived back to our room at the end of the next day the maids had been in. All they seemed to have done was made the bed. It was not the standard that I've had in other hotels whereby it looks as if its been cleaned. The bathroom floor did not look like it had been mopped. They replenished some toiletries, towels, coffee but no additional biscuits :-(\nWe had drinks and a snack in the bar one evening - pretty average choices and not that impressed.\nGreat location in Victoria but I'd not rush back to book here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:56.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
