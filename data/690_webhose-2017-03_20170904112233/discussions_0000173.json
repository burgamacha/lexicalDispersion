Everyone from the GM to the agent who checked us in was above any of my expectations! We were greeted with a smile at the desk from a long flight and they got us into our room early even though check in is at 4pm! Every time we left the hotel the desk made it a point to say hello and goodbye! I felt at home! The rooms were cool with the work out gear even though we did not use it... Cool Concept! Location is great and only a couple minute walk from Pen Station! When i come back to NY i will ALWAYS stay at the Even Hotel! Thanks again for a great stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:40:37.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
