Easy walk from the Gare du Nord station, allowing easy access to CDG airport. I had some Accor Vouchers to use at check in, and although the person on when I arrived (quite late) wasn't sure what to do with them, they allowed me to check in and pay only the amount I would need to pay without using the voucher (with the vouchers redeemed the next day). The room had a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Free bottle of water and a pack of lollies on arrival. Access to the hotel is strictly controlled with people only being let in when they push the door bell at all times, increasing security. Breakfast is included in the room rate and was a good continental selection. Housekeeping was fast and efficient. Overall a very good stay.\nWhilst close to the Gare du Nord station, I took advantage of the shuttle to the airport organised by the hotel which was 26 euro one way. Cheaper than paying for a cab and removed the hassle of getting to the airport by train.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:46:30.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
