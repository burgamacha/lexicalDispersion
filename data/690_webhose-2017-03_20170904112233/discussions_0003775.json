We stayed in one of the two rooms off the garden on ground level . While not a peep could be heard from the street at night , it should be mentioned that the squeals of schoolchildren at play from the school adjoining the hotel would have likely awoken late sleepers - that was not an issue for us however. The room was spacious by Parisian standards), well appointed and the washroom was generously supplied with Hermes toiletries. One appreciated feature was a book shelf stocked with Paris guide-books and novels. The quality of the full breakfast served in the lounge overlooking the charming garden and included in our rate was outstanding.\nThe main lounge area is nicely appointed with comfortable sofas and chairs to relax in by the fireplace. Reception staff are courteous, efficient.and well-informed. We found the hotel to be of overall great value in comparison to many other hotels we have stayed at in Paris.\nThere is nothing not to love about Villa Madame and we plan on making it our new favourite little hotel in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:06:38.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
