I and my husband came to Italy on a holiday trip from Vietnam just last month. We found this hotel online and were very pleased with our experience at the Rome Style Hotel.\nThe well decorated with warm lighting room created a very leisure atmosphere, but furthermore it was the great service offered by the staff. We felt like home specifically because of your enthusiasm. The trip would not have been perfect without the breakfast prepared by the hotel. Everything was fresh and nicely arranged. We often had breakfast under the great service of Ms. Eriselola with her constant smile.\nIf we happen to visit Rome again we will definitely stay at Rome Style Hotel, as well as recommending it to all our friends when visiting the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:44:37.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
