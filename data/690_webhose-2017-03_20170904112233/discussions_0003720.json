From check-in through check-out, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The front desk staff, especially Saad and Fourzia, were very helpful, warm, and professional. Our room ( the Sorbonne-2 twin beds street view) was not large but the space was well appointed. The bathroom was equipped with a magnifying mirror and the shower water pressure was divine! Complimentary water upon arrival, honor bar, afternoon coffee, tea and cake, and a fitness center were some of the other amenities. This hotel is 3 minutes walk to the Sorbonne and about 7 minutes to Notre Dame.\nMy only quibble: there could be heavier dumb bells in the fitness center!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:39:46.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
