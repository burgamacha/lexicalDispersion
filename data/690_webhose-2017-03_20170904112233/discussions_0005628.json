First, you need to understand what kind of rooms they have and who they cater to. To me, this is a hotel for professionals that need an overnight stay. The rooms are quite small and closet space is extremely limited. The beds are comfortable. Nice TV. Very quiet. Bathroom doesn't have a large counter so if you require a ton of stuff to get ready for the day/night, this likely isn't for you. The rooms are immaculately clean though. Hotel staff are courteous and gave me a late checkout with zero hassle. They have an excellent restaurant called Covina that was very impressive. Knowledgeable bartenders, classy atmosphere, and delicious food. The real star here, for us, was MARIO. He was the doorman when we left. He tried to hail a cab for us but with all the St. Patrick's Day stuff happening, this proved difficult on the side street the hotel is located. A car service pulled up and tried to charge $80 for the 8 mile ride to LaGuardia. Mario called b.s. on that and took us and our luggage down to the corner, where he stayed until he got us a cab, loaded our luggage, and saw us safely on our way. This is why you learn to tip and appreciate outstanding service when you find it. It's rare nowadays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:37:34.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
