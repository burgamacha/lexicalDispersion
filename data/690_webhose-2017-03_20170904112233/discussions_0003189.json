This hotel is located in the Montparnasse area, 4 minute walk away from the Raspail Metro stop. There are many cafes and restaurants located in the area. The hotel staff was very helpful. You have to leave your key with the front desk while you are out, and my last night on my way in the manager confirmed I was checking out the next morning and asked me if I needed help making arrangements to get to the airport. He scheduled a Taxi for me, informed me of the price, and provided a wakeup call, as well as a call to let me know my taxi was outside. The room was a quaint, clean, and modern room in the 6th floor with a beautiful street view. The area is very quiet but I felt safe getting off the metro late. The shower was very small and just worked for a 5'6\" woman, so not sure how difficult a taller person may find it. Overall wonderful stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:10:30.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
