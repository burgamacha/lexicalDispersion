On our last day in Paris I surprised her with a room at Hotel Da Vinci. Everything about the hotel was romantic, elegant, luxurious, and highly professional. The rooms were beautiful (we had a small balcony) and we were greeted with a bottle of prosecco. The hotel itself is beautifully designed and simply a pleasure to be in (it also smells amazing). Staff is friendly and attentive to your every need. Breakfast was well stocked and delicious. And the spa was just awesome. We will certainly be going to this hotel again and recommending to all of our friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:22:36.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
