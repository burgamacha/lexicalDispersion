To make me happy they were nice enough to upgrade me from a simple cheap queen bed room to a two room, two bathroom suite with a walk out balcony that had views of MSG and the empire state building. The room was a little rough around the edges, but that's ok it's an old building in new york city. The bed was still equally smaller than I expected. But the customer service and the view were great for the price.\nRoom Tip: Some rooms have a sliding glass door onto a balcony with chairs.
