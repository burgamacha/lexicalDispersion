Extremely convinient !\nThe hotel bedrooms are quite large for Paris and my bed was confortable. My check in was efficient and breakfast overall good.\nI had free wifi in my bedroom and it worked well.\nI would only regret my window view as i didn't had an outdoor view but was facing the interior of the CNIT and reception which result in lack of privacy. Your curtain must be 100% of the time closed overwise everybody can see through your room and you dont't get natural daylight... very strange building agencement; I didn't appreciate that, but despite this I really like all the rest.\nRoom Tip: Room with outdoor view.
