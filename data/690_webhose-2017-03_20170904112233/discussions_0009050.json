I had stayed in the Premier Inn in Angel Islington before and I wanted to come back to this hotels as the experience was very positive before. Of all the hotels I've been in London this chain is by far the best. The premier Inn in Aldgate is very well communicated by metro and bus and has a supermarket near by. The breakfast was fantastic and the restaurant is designed to provide you with a quiet table even when it is so big. The staff are very nice. Beds are excellent and there is no noise in the rooms. There is free wi-fi as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:27:26.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
