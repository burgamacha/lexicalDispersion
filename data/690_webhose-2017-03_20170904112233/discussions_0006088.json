The staff were all very helpful, and I never needed to visit the concierge on the 4th floor because the bell staff were knowledgeable and could tell me everything I needed to know.\nMy room (on the 27th floor) had a great view, wasn't enormous, but the queen bed didn't take up too much room, and I was easily able to work on my laptop as required.\nNo bath, if that matters to you.\nGiven the weather, I requested an extra blanket, which was provided with no question.\nThe bar on the 4th floor provides basic breakfast facilities, but the happy hour is worth a visit for cheap beer and complementary hors d'oeuvres.\nRoom Tip: 2709 is quite high, had good views.
