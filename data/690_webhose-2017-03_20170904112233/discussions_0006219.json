Firstly I would say if you're coming from the Termini get the metro to Agnes not Bologna... you will have a hell of a walk from Bologna!\nI arrived at 12 but check in was at 2 so left bags and went sight seeing. Came back and the room was ready. It had everything you need but being English I would have loved a kettle and tea facilities! The room had plenty of storage, a safe and a fridge! The bathroom was clean!\nAll the staff we spoke to were lovely.\nThe only downfall was how noisy it was! I think I was by the kitchen (room 122 on the ground floor)\nAll in all, clean and comfortable for what I wanted and I would definitely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:33:11.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
