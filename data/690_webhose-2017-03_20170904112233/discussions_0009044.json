It's close enough to do a leisure walk to Times Square and there is a subway station right next to the hotel, making this a very convenient location. Our party of seven recently stayed at Park Central for four nights during February, and I am so glad we picked Park Central. A few days during the trip, weather was turning really ugly with snowstorm and rain. It was so easy to just go out the door and down into the subway and keep going to our destination. Our rooms were good sized (especially in NYC) and the beds were comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Park Central.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:00:14.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
