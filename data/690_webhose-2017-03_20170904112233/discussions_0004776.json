You are within a 2-3 minute walk to the World Trade Center memorial and less than 30 second walk to different metro lines that connect you to almost anywhere you want to go in Manhattan. There are a few good restaurants around where you can grab a bite. Also it is right across a Dunkin Donuts and a couple of Starbucks Cafes.\nUnfortunately, not all staff members can be very friendly.\nPros:\n- Great Location\n- Clean Rooms, good TV set available and many power plugs\n- New Facility\n- You get a Keurig Machine that makes exceptional coffee\nCons:\n- Small Rooms\n- Front Desk Staff is not exceptionally friendly all the time\nAll in all, the hotel provides a very good experience, nothing exceptional to blow your mind but it just does everything right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:28:10.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
