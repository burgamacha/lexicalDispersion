It was also a reasonable distance to walk from the hotel to the Brooklyn bridge (we walked with a 6y and 11y without complaints).\nWhen we booked a week in februari we got down to a average price of around $100 per night for a double bed room. I have to agree that the rooms are small but in the end we only slept there so price vs. space this was a bargain. When it came to the beds they were more than fine (I slept really good and I have a bad back which can act up it the beds are to firm or to soft). you have to watch out for a remember that the sound level is quite high in the city areas. It didn't bother me but if you are a light sleeper don't forget earplugs.\nThe cleaning was ok and the staff was very helpful (e.g. they arranged a pick up service from the hotel to the airport for us and price was cheaper than Uber or \"yellow cab\").\nIn the end do not except a five star hotel but instead you will get a great location for decent price (at least compared to other hotels in the NY).\nRoom Tip: Try to get on of the top floors (we stayed at level 10) which had nice view of the block.
