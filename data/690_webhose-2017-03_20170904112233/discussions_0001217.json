This time I decide to try something much more affordable for the quick 3 night trip going to Europe. I ended up finding the best price via travelzoo which was odd that the hotel wouldn't match it when I called directly.\nI was a little hesitant booking this hotel based off the location at first. It is basically on the corner of little Italy, china town and soho. But I think it's technically in little Italy. Bowery and canal street subways are within a few minutes of walking.\nWe arrived shortly before 4pm before JFK. Checked in a brand new modern boutique hotel. We were explains how things work and were told there are free pastries at 7:30am in the morning (delicious!!!) btw but are first come first serve basis. We were given a room on the 2nd floor which at first I was a bit disappointed. Luckily it was facing towards the back of the property and we had a small patio. Albeit it was covered in snow, but none the less it was absolutely silent. If you were coming to NYC for the views i probably would have been disappointed or asked for a better room. We had a huge king bed. Size of the room was plenty big for NYC standards. Room was neat, clean and modern. Overall the hotel was great for a no frills stay. I would definitely stay here again if I was on a budget.\nStaff was also very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:54:34.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
