Clearly check in is not until 4 o'clock. We were greeted by a very nice young lady named Jennay. (Probably spelled wrong). She was very personable and took our phone number so she could call us if a room opened up early. About one hour later she did exactly that. We did not expect that she would call but she did and she was extremely helpful and friendly and even found us a larger room on a higher floor. Beyond that the room was very nice as was the hotel itself. Breakfast was excellent as well. The view was pretty cool too.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:56:17.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
