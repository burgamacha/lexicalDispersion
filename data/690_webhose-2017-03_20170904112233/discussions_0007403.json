The rooms are large & 606 has an expansive lounge with a good fold down divan. Views are to die for. The front staff are extremely friendly & efficient, nothing is of any trouble. There's lots to see even at this end of town & the bus network is second to none.\nSplendid Etoile is very highly recommended & a great place to finish off your France trip before boarding your flight home.\nRoom Tip: Try 606 for views & sheer luxury See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:01:11.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
