This is a classy business style hotel with fab service and modern finishes. As it was a special occasion the hotel had noted this within the booking and had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was lovely. Complimentary handmade chocolates and a hand written card had been left too. The room was up in the loft with views of the London Eye and Big Ben. Luxuries included Elemis smellies, Nespresso coffee pods and Jelly belly beans and Pringles. The Apex Temple Court Hotel is in a great location just off the Southbank of the Thames and close to Fleet Street. After a long days walking it was great to relax at the hotel. We ate dinner there too and this was pretty good - about Â£100 for two with wine. All in all was a fab stay and we are already thinking about when to go again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:07:25.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
