Travelling from CDG airport to Montparnasse was very easy, taking the designated bus transportation just outside airport buildings and costing 18e. Montparnasse station was a 5 to 7 minute easy walk away to or from the Mercure. In and out of the reception was very quick, desk clerks speaking English. Room was decent a size with adiquate bathroom, clothes storage, safe and tea coffee making facilities. Wi-fi in the hotel worked OK and was included in the price. Also included in the price was breakfast, which to my surprise was hot and cold buffet, very nicely presented with plenty of choice.\nThe hotel is sited in the theatre district and therefore plenty of restraunts nearby. We were also able to get a Metro train directly to Versaile, about 40 minutes away.\nIn conclusion the hotel was sensibly priced, comfortable, good facilities in a convenient location. We would not hesitate in returning there in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:37:44.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
