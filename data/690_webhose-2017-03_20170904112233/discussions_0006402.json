But we were delighted when checking into the hotel. The man at front desk who checked us in was lovely, he was cheery and asked about our flight, made us feel welcomed. He told us we couldn't check in but could luggage with the bellboys. When we went over to leave our luggage the man went and checked if they room was ready he came back and said that the level our room was on was nearly done so he took our cases and us up to our room. It maid was just finishing up so he out our cases in our room and gave us the key and told us to come back in half hour and room would be ready which it was. The room was clean and spacious, we were worried that the noise from the busy city would be a problem but we didn't hear any noise whilst trying to sleep. Hotel is in a great location two minute walk to Central Park and three minute the other way to Times Square. Would defiantly stay at this hotel again if I were to come back to the city. Great value for money and would rate it more than what it is! We got the subway from the JFK airport and it was very easy got air shuttle from airport which is $5 each which is paid when you get off. We then took subwaybE and got of at 7th av and 53rd street stop which was like 12/13 stops didn't take long. Amazing time in the city, I would recommend eating at shake shack and Ellen stardust diner!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:30:23.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
