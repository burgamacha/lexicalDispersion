It's centrally located just one block from Rue Richelieu. The hotel is constructed much better than other boutique hotels we've stayed at in Paris. The rooms are heavy on design but completely comfortable and inviting. Our room was quite large by Paris standards. It was quiet throughout the night and the bed was firm but excellent. The bath was also worth mentioning. It's quite large and very comfortable.\nI can't not mention the incredible staff. Every one we spoke with were friendly and professional. Adrien was particularly something else. He went above and beyond helping us with some restaurant reservations.\nWe had no time to enjoy the spa but we were down there and it looked surprisingly excellent considering the size of the hotel. We will make this a regular spot for us in the future.\nRoom Tip: The rooms on the second floor had quite large ceilings and were spacious.
