We loved the location in Monmartre. Easy access to the Metro and great restaurants within easy walking distance of the Hotel. Great, after long walking days in Paris. The view from our window of the Eiffel Tower was spectacular and even looking down on the famous Cemetary was most interesting. The view from the 7th floor patio was beautiful.\nRoom Tip: Our room was 504 - lovely views!!
