The welcome in the hotel was very nice and I received a good recommendation for a restaurant on the first evening. From the Novotel London City South you are literally 5 minutes away from the Tate Modern which allowed us to visit different parts of the museum on 2 days. Furthermore, the Borough market is around the corner and so are many other great restaurants! Fortunately we had great weather so it also allowed us to stroll across the Thames towards Westminster while visiting Leake street with all its beautiful graffiti.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:34:51.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
