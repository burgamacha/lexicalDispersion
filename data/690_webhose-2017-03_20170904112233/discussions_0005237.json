Perfect in every way. All of the staff was wonderful. They addressed us by name at every turn with a smile and a hello. Made us feel very special. We walked everywhere; all Broadway theaters, Madison Square Garden, just steps from Time Square. The continental breakfast was everything we needed. One morning we missed the breakfast and I went down to grab a couple of cups of coffee to take back to the room. Wonderful Lily said, \"I missed you this morning\" and put together a wonderful coffee tray for me to carry back to the room for my husband and myself. We loved the wine and cheese before heading to the theater. Stopped for cookies and hot chocolate on the way back in at night. Fabulous small boutique hotel for the price!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:51:06.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
