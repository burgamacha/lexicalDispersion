Price was very good for the quality and location and staff very helpful especially Nayja (not sure how it's spelled).\nWe got a discount coupon for breakfast and liked it a lot, the wifi was bad in our room but it was fixed and worked just fine after we told the staff. Everything was really clean and the room was warm.\nOnly disappointment was that my boyfriend had requested a bottle of wine and glasses to be in our room the night he proposed but the staff could not arrange it, later on they brought us a fruit basket witch was nice but not as nice as a bottle of wine.\nLovely hotel, great spot, friendly staff and good value for money!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:28:07.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
