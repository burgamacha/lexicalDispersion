We stayed for two nights, we were treated in a very professional and extremely polite way. All the receptionist knew perfectly our language (italian), so that when we checked in, they explained in the most clear way all the rules/timetables. The structure is about 100 meters or less frome the subway, and the neighbourhood is lively and full of restaurant. There is also a Supermarket and a beautiful curch just around the corner! The room was very comfortable, equipped with an electric kettle, two cups, some teabags, a hair dryer and an iron with ironing board. The bathroom was large and \"cozy\". BUT, there were two factors which quite runied our stay: first of all, the extremely high temperature in the room (even the A/C was not enough to lower it), which undermined our sleep quality, and the noise coming from the hallway, which is probably due to a \"bad-noise-isolated\" door. Still, I would absolutely reccomend this Hotel, since its \"pros\" are so much more than its \"cons\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:58:56.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
