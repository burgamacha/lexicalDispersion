We felt so cared for in every way during our stay. The service was impeccable. Rooms are beautiful with every amenity - and wonderful art deco decor. The beds were incredibly comfortable with luxurious ultra soft bedding. We met friends for drinks in the cub bar, for hotel guests only- which was divine. Felt like a secret club room. Great spa as well. Had one of the best massages in my life by Chantal. The location is unbeatable -in the heart of Mayfair. We've stayed at some of the best hotels in London and around the world - but this is now our new favorite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:16:38.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
