The location is near the metro station Wagram, literally a minute or two away. Perfect to get to anywhere in paris... the prices for metro tickets are probably the cheapest thing in paris. You can use one ticket for one way, however it is ideal to purchase multiple tickets at a time. We brought 10 at a time between us both. Worked out perfect!\nThe hotel is small and doesn't look great from the outside but never judge a book by its cover. The staff are so welcoming and accommodating, they really do go out there way for you. Always willing to give you information and help you out whenever required.\nRight now the rooms! Whether this was just our room or a common issue we will never know. The rooms are not sound proof... we were woken up quite early by the sounds of the water, toilet, shower, people talking etc. So if you are hoping to sleep in, this may not be ideal. Didn't really bother us much as we got up early anyway.\nThe bathroom is nice however our shower was tiny but powerful. So did it's job!\nOn the plus side, the hotel is surrounded by many shops and restaurants. There is a supermarket a door a way, which is perfect for buying drinks, snacks and other bits n bobs. Closes at 8:30pm, however there is a little shop run by a old man just as you exit the wagram station. His shop is open till very late and we often ended up buying drinks etc from him. He's so sweet!\nThis hotel is perfect to get to places very easily and the staff are lovely. Honestly we couldn't ask for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:00:09.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
