They loved Citadines. It was really clean; the beds were nice. We had 2 rooms. It has a full kitchen. And it had a view of the Eiffel Tower. The best thing was that the mall was right behind it. We can shop for clothes, food, etc. To its left, more restaurants and the Metro (subway), to its right, a McDonald's. Definitely a great place for a family!\nRoom Tip: upper rooms get view of Eiffel Tower See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:33:37.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
