She decided to treat me with a one night stay in occasion of my birthday. Everything from the start until the end was perfect. We were welcomed by a very nice young man who showed us around and took us to our room. As soon as we entered we felt so homely and the room was superbly designed with lots of little touches such as iron and ironing board and coffee facilities. As they found out that it was my birthday they organised a delicious cupcake in the room and a sweet card! I was so impressed! The breakfast in the morning was simply delicious and plenty of healthy options which is exactly what I like. I also saw many people having afternoon tea which unfortunately we had no time to have but, as I live close to London and looked so yummy, I will surely go back and try it out next time!\nThank you for making our stay so special!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:43:23.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
