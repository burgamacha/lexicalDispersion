It is intimate, superbly appointed, has a marvelous staff, and extremely comfortable accommodations. The staff could not have been more attentive, helpful and always cheerful. The bar is one of the highlights of the hotel. It is cozy, very British, has great martinis and a fabulous bartender. Breakfast is not to be missed.
