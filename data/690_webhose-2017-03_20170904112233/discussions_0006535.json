We chose Hotel Mela because it was very close to the restaurant and the theater we were going to. Hotel Mela is on 44th and 7th, restaurant was on 43rd and 7th and the theater we went to was on 42nd, all within one block of each other, and right by Times Square. Perfect Location. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly. I'm sure we will consider staying at Hotel Mela on our next trip to NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:58.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
