Although we had arrived quite early our room was ready. Debra asked if we were on Spring Break and I mentioned that we were celebrating my daughter's Sweet 16. When we returned from walking through Central Park there was a Sweet 16 ballon and a tower of sweet treats waiting on her bed with a note from Debra wishing her a Happy Birthday. I could fly home right now and the trip would have been worth it!\nOnto the room. We reserved the Family Suite and it is fabulous! a 2 bedroom suite with a sitting/office area. So much room to spread out. The beds are comfy and the decor elegant. We are loving our choice, thank you most especially Debra, and all the wonderful folks at the Lucerne.\nRoom Tip: The Family Suite is perfect for traveling with kids.
