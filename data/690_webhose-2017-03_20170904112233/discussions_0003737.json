My wife gave a talk one evening and needed a lot of support printing things and more and they were so gracious and helpful. On our last day I left our passports in the safe (!) and they met us at the train station so we wouldn't miss our train. Not only did they bring the passports they brought our daughter's stuffed animal that we didn't realize we left in the room! Cyril and the others were fantastic. The cleaning staff are also worth mentioning. We had a ton of stuff and they did a really nice job cleaning around our many bags, etc. We didn't want to leave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:49:52.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
