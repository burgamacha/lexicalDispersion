The location is perfect--a couple of blocks from Victoria Station with so much of what London has to offer at the hotel's doorstep. The rooms are clean and well-appointed. Everything works. Our bed was comfortable. The bathroom is spacious with a large shower. We put the efficiency kitchen to good use for tea, coffee, and breakfast. (There's a Waitrose for provisions a block away.) Best of all is the staff. They are super friendly without being intrusive. They are responsive. They made our stay at the hotel lovely. All in all, a nice visit. I'll be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:03:52.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
