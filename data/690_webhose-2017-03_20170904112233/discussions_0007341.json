One guy, sorry I can't remember his name .. but he was the only man we saw working there, he couldn't do enough to help us feel comfortable. He assisted us, in making sure we were able to eat in the restaurant at 6pm exactly, as we were due out at 7pm for a party we were invited to. He took our orders and made sure we got the best deal... when we came down at 6pm he sat us down and brought the meals out as promised, he also booked us a taxi for us and negotiated the times with the taxi firm etc. He was very helpful.\nThe premier inn at Borough market were amazing too, I had left my wallet in the room on the day we left, and we walked along the Thames before I realised I'd left it, as premier inn borough market was near by, they were only too happy to assist and call their sister hotel to ask for their help. Between them the wallet was found and I can't thank them enough.\nClean rooms\nNice food\nGreat service.
