I will start with information for the first time traveler to London. This hotel is located in the best of neighborhoods. You step out the front door turn left another quick left and you will have a grocery store, a bank, an exchange bureau, an abundance of restaurants and shortly down the road access to South Kensington tube station. Take a right, the Museum of Natural History, Victoria and Albert Museum, and shortly down the road Kensington Palace. This is an ideal location for the first time traveler. For the repeat traveler to London, this hotel is exceptional in service. I read many reviews before I decided to stay here and most revolved around the hotel needing to be updated. I really don't understand that. It is picturesque. The furniture completely fitting to the atmosphere and let's add a fire to the fireplace in every room for effect. The authenticity is so great that many locals have tea and casual meetings in one of the two adjacent rooms to the lobby and the bar. The staff is exceptional. I don't have to name them because they are all exceptional. I have rated this hotel with five stars, not because it is the most extravagant hotel in London, but because it is the most realistic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:29:13.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
