This visit was a quick one night stay. After an early start from the UK we arrived at the hotel at 0930 (it's just 15 mins metro journey from Gare du Nord and a short few minutes,walk). We intended to just drop r bags and head out for a late breakfast. The lovely receptionist suggested we might like to grab breakfast at the hotel....and for no charge. She explained there was a problem with the elevator so our request for a fourth floor room could not be honoured but that we had a lovely room on the second floor. Revived from the breakfast we set off for our day in the city...as we went two bottles of free water and an invite to take an umbrella were forthcoming. Touches like this together with free soft drinks and cake all afternoon set this hotel apart from others. After six visits here they never fail to deliver. Great location, good size rooms for Paris, great comfy beds and hot effective showers..You can't go wrong. Thank you Monterosa,\nRoom Tip: Rooms at front have street view.
