It was a wonderful hotel in a great location. The staff was very helpful, professional, and friendly. The hotel is located one block from the start of the Buckingham Palace property and the surrounding parks. It is also very close to the Underground. A grocery store is one block away which makes it very convenient (the hotel has a refrigerator). Plenty of coffee is provided in the hotel including a expresso maker. Many restaurants are close to the hotel. Overall - I was very pleased with my stay here and I would highly recommend it! Wonderful time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:00:42.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
