Entering a sky view room is breathtaking, we were on the 25th floor and had no complaints. Advertised as a micro hotel and it was. Small amount of floor space, but fine for two pieces of small carry-on luggage. If we were staying for a week with larger bags it would have been very tight, but sliding cases under the bed would work. Well appointed with necessities including hand held steamer\nWonderfully cozy bed, we both had a nice sleep. There was a great jazz trio playing in the second floor lobby, wish we had time to sit and enjoy! Everywhere we wanted to go was easily accessible by uber or subway. Lots to do within walking distance. Excellent service, including checked baggage for prior to checkin and after checkout.\nWill be returning!\nRoom Tip: Sky room to maximize your stay in NYC See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:38:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
