Except that mine (only bathroom out of 8 rooms) had no shower curtain and the floor was full of water when I got a shower. I had to use lots of towels to clean the floor.\nThe breakfast is very cute and personalized, with very good bread, ham, butter, eggs, juices, yogurts, etc.\nThe service was just EXCELLENT. From the manager to the stuff, excellent.\nLocation can't be better if you enjoy Le Marais.\nThe one thing that you should be aware is that the internet service the hotel has is not good. The internet went out at 10pm and the guy who was at night couldn't fix it until the manager arrived next day.\nConclusion: If you enjoy very small hotels with just a few staff members, this hotel is right for you. But if you prefer to have people in the lobby, huge facilities, and lots of staff, this hotel is not for you.\nFor instance, I decided to come back because I LOVED IT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:33:28.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
