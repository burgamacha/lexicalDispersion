Saying good morning, have a good day, we hope you enjoyed your stay ect makes a huge difference to guests and made this hotel stand apart from other places we have stayed in the city were we felt like a number rather than a valued guest. Well done guys!\nThe Location\nTimes Square is at the end of the Street but most of the other key attractions are within 10 minutes walking distance which means you can pack more into your day without having to factor in spending time on the subway ect.\nAlthough the hotel is central when you step instead the doors you feel away from the busy streets and in a trendy, slick, calm 'sancutary'...I guess the clues in the name!\nThe Shower & Bedroom\nTwo favourite and seemingly most important things in the room! After hours walking round sight seeing the huge hot shower was amazing and the bed was incredibly comfortable.\nI wasn't sure I would like the concept of the bathroom but it worked really well for us.\nBreakfast & The Bar/Restaurant\nThe breakfast selection is minimal (toast, fruit, cereal) BUT this was still a big bonus for us. I hate having to head out first thing in the morning to find coffee and breakfast, being able to wake up and nip down stairs to start the day before getting wrapped up (it was a cold week in March) was perfect.\nWe sadly didn't get time to eat in the restaurant or visit the roof top bar which I am gutted about but it was nice to have the option inside of the hotel and from what we saw from the rest of the hotel I'm sure they would be brilliant.\nWe made a couple of request both before and during our stay and these were sorted quickly and efficiently.\nI would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:30:00.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
