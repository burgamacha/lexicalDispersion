Despite being in NYC, it was the most spacious and clean living space we had during our three-week trip.\nThe hotel is situated in Chinatown—while this location is quite central to many attractions, the hotel's surrounds are quite grotty. But, obviously, you are only in Chinatown to get to and from the subway, and to sleep.\nThe reception staff were friendly each time I dealt with them—they kindly swapped my $5 note for quarters to use at the hotel's laundry facilities. Washing is $3 USD, the dryer is under $2 USD and washing powder is 75 cents. There's also vending machines on the fourth floor—one for snacks and one for drinks.\nOnly downside to our stay is that we couldn't quite get the heater to work. Or perhaps it did work, but the heat didn't travel any further than if you were to stand directly under it. Oh, and a fridge would have been nice! One guest also complained about the noise from the train—there's definitely noise from the train, and it passes by often, but it's the only noise you can hear. It wasn't a big problem for either of us during our seven-night stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:29:07.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
