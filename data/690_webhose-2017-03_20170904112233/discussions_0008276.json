This apparently gave us the extras, like having a TV, toiletries, towels and wireless internet. Which was nice as it seems all these things are pay to play other wise.\nThe toiletries were quite good, and enough for our 4 night stay. When they cleaned our room, they tossed out our bar of soap that was on the sink, and the half used shampoo/body wash bottles in the shower. Didn't replace them, so we ended up with nothing. Which was a little annoying.\nThe shower had pressure, and hot water on the ready. The beds were quite comfortable, and the room was a lot more spacious than the average London hotel at this price point. The service at the desk was great, very friendly welcomes and good byes.\nThe internet however, was garbage. It said our code was valid for up to 5 devices. We had 3 connected to it and internet would drop, or not be allowed as we had more than 5 devices (according to the service) connected. This happened multiple times over our stay. It was very strange, as we'd get back from our days out and go online to find a restaurant or something to do that night. Typically, which ever device connected first was fine, the others either wouldn't be allowed online, or would take an hour or two before it was allowed.\nThe internet is really the only downside to my stay. The taking away of the toiletries was annoying, but we had some with us so it wasn't that big of a deal. Outside this, we constantly questioned why we stayed in this area. There are much nicer, more central, easier to arrive at from the tube areas of London. We ended up here because we wanted to try out Tune hotel, or now Point A hotel as they've re-branded. But still don't see a point in staying at this location unless one needs quick service from Paddington in the early mornings. Otherwise, stay somewhere with better tube connections or more of an atmosphere in the local area.\nOne benefit to the area is the Wallace Collection, which is maybe a 15-20 minute walk away. Fantastic place to visit that wasn't even crowded during the school holiday. Free entry as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:18:08.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
