I spoke to Anthony, and he was very helpful and assured me that the hotel was within walking distance to the meet. Once checked in, we were happy to have a hotel close to the event, but it was even better to find great service and amenities. The rooms were efficient, comfortable and very clean. The staff was wonderful and friendly, the early breakfast was appreciated, and the views are great. Even better is the neighborhood - we bought snacks from the deli across the street, ate in a restaurant close by, had food delivered in, and my husband got a haircut at the barbershop around the corner! Cannot say enough good things about our stay, and we will definitely stay here again!!!\nRoom Tip: Corner room was very quiet.
