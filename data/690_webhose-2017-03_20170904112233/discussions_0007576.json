Great alternative to the multi-national behemoths of Hyatt and Meridien attached to the conference centre. Staff were always pleasant and responsive. Room and bathroom were a good size (for Paris) and well appointed with a Nespresso machine, towel warmer, satellite TV, ultra comfortable bed. This is an intimate hotel with only six rooms per floor so it's super quiet and private. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:51:22.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
