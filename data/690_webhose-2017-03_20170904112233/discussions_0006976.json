The location was close to my office so it worked perfectly, staff was cheerful, considerate and generous. I'd requested a high floor, and Ramona made my trip! She organized a beautiful room for me, and the rest of the staff was just as cheerful and helpful.\nI will continue to stay here on future trips to NYC. The experience of great service is something that transports a guest to another place. For me, after two 18 hour days on a business trip, Ramona and the rest of the staff, transported me to feel right at home.\nRoom Tip: great views, fantastic location, parking garage a block away See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:24:08.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
