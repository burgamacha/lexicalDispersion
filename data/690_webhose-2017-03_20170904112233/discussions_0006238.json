The rooms were a typical size for a Paris hotel (small), but very well decorated, with lots of nice touches. Good bathroom, hot shower (but careful if like me you are 1.93m or taller - you cannot stand upright in the shower), free amenities. Very comfortable bed, our room had a little balcony (5th floor). The aircon in our room only seemed to blow out heat, but we slept with the window open and that was fine, once you got over the noise from the street below.\nFree breakfast was very good, also free snacks, fruit and soft drinks throughout the rest of the day and evening, at this hotel and any others in the same Astotel Group. That's a good touch.\nThe hotel is 100m from Blanche Metro, buses stop outside, and taxis are easy to come by.\nAll in all, great value for money, friendly staff, enjoyable.\nRoom Tip: 5th floor at the front has a small balcony!
