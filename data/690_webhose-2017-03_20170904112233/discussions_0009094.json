Price is reasonable for New York. Elsewhere it's a $120-$150 per room per night here it is $250-$300. We came for a weekend and had 2 rooms reserved. Both were very clean.\nCheck in was very quick, staff was great. I was a little surprised that their restaurant was still closed for renovations, so we couldn't get breakfast. When I was booking about a month ago I was under impression it would be done but I guess delays happen.\nThe one thing I found surprising was that even on 9th floor with closed windows you still could here a lot of street noise. We've stayed in other hotels on and around Times Square before and I don't remember the noise. But that was a minor thing in otherwise great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:44:40.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
