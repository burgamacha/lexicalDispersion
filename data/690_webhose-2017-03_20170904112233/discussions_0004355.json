Breakfast is a real highlight, great spread and there are snacks and tea available all the time. Good quality rooms and nice modern clean feel. I visited with my mother planning on a 1 night stay, got upgraded to a beautiful suite. They survey you before for anything you might need so we were given adaptors when we arrived and a great restaurant list in advance. at least 2 really great restaurants nearby. Our Eurostar home was cancelled and the hotel kindly helped out, gave us a lovely room for the second night at a decent price and breakfast. Really appreciated the kindness in our hour of need. 2 mins walk from the metro station, so perfect for getting around and only 25 mins from gare du nord.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:35:16.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
