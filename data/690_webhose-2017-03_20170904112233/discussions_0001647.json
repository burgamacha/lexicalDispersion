I asked if very was anywhere I could get the hire car cleaned, no problem leave it with us and it will be done tomorrow and it was.\nWe checked in and where then given a quick tour of where everything was and then taken to our room, 226. For us this was perfect as there is a balcony not all the rooms on the first floor have this. We had a large ensuite with a full size shower and separate bath. The room is well appointed and there was a complimentary mini bar and bottle of wine.\nWe had pre dinner drinks in the bar and then were taken through to the restaurant. The service and the food was excellent and beautiful presented service was professional and not over bearing. We had breakfast on the terrace and there was a fantastic selection of fruit, cereals and meat plus also a variety of cooked options.\nEveryone we have encountered were a delight to deal with and absolutely nothing was too much trouble.\nI have been very very lucky to stay in a variety of hotels but this is in my top ten now!\nRoom Tip: Ask for one with a balcony overlooking Walkers Bay See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:51:10.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
