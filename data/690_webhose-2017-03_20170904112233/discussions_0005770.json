We took a train in to get an early start and were expecting to drop off our bag and be on our way to check in later. The staff was great and checked us in very early AND had upgraded us! We also had a surprise treat waiting for us. Everyone was so nice and helpful and the room was great and spacious. Not what are used to in NYC. The location was great for walking to Rockefeller, Times Square, dinner and our Broadway show. We both slept like babies when we got back late that evening! *We did drop in on the bar before we called it a night and it was packed, the only knock on it was the drink variety and price range but still a good time. This was our first time staying here and we definitely would again in a heartbeat! -Jason", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:02:17.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
