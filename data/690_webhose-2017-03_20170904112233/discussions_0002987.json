Having flown all night and arriving in the lobby at 10:00 am, I was thrilled to learn that 1 of our 2 rooms was ready. This made life much easier. The staff at the front desk was very accommodating. The room was comfortable, modern and updated. Great shower and roomy bathroom. The WIFI was excellent. Upon leaving the hotel we learned the location was excellent and close to many restaurants, shopping and attractions. The breakfast we good and the service excellent. Rome is great in that they have Uber but if you prefer, there is a taxi stand right across the street if you need to get to the airport or train station. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:35:18.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
