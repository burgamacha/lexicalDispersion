It was within walking distance to the metro and other great restaurants. The staff were very friendly and we never had any issues during our 6 night stay.\nThe only thing that took away from a 5 star review was that the room got quite hot at times and since the thermostat wasn't working, we opened the windows and it got noisy. But when the windows were closed the window blocked out the noise pretty well and we were never woken up at night. We never heard our neighbors upstairs or adjacent to us - only when they were coming and going from their rooms, since the room door isn't 100% soundproof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:36:19.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
