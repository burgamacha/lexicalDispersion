Its not easy to find as its tucked away down a very quiet road which is part of it's appeal. The rooms are small but very clean and well equipped. The bathrooms are modern with showers. Our room had a fridge and safe and i'm fairly sure this is standard in all rooms. The room had air conditioning which we didn't need to use and modern double glazing. Staff are helpful and friendly. The hotel provides breakfast in a very nice, clean and well equipped cavern in the basement. The breakfast is buffet style. It is mainly continental style but basic bacon, eggs and sausages are available too. The only problem we experienced with breakfast was the replenishing of food availability. When things run out they are very very slow in replenishing. Guests often had to ask for food items that had ran out and then took ages to arrive.This is very bad given that breakfast costs â‚¬16. The food quality is very good. This is a nice, friendly and clean hotel about 10 minutes walk from the gare du nord train station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:33:26.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
