It's well situated (subway lines are close and you're near the heart of the Marais), the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, the breakfast is delicious, the bathroom is spacious. But the staff are unbearably rude. It's as though they don't understand the word hospitality is a derivative of the word hospitable. The front deskman had the greatest amount of attitude when his own shuttle driver was 25 minutes late taking me to the airport. He would not even call on my behalf or give me a refund so that I could take an uber. Unbelievably rude. His face even contorted in anger as we was talking to me. If you can manage it, find a four star hotel that actually values you and makes your stay pleasant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:31:18.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
