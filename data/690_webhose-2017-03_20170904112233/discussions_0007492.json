A few blocks down to 34th and you can stroll up to everything via the main sights of 34th. Check in was efficient and our 1 bed suite was a good size with even a glimpse of the Chrysler building from the back. As a family with 2 teenagers we like the suite option although the kitchen is a bit superfluous and a second bathroom would be preferable. The coffee machine was all we used and on the one night we had a take away Chinese we realised how barely equipped the kitchen is with mugs being the most you get.\nGood size bed and sofa bed although we had to do a little furniture arranging to enable it staying out all week. The general fabric of the rooms is a little dated and not really boutique as others have described, however the housekeeping was excellent and we always returned to a very well cleaned and serviced room.\nNo issues or restrictions with the free wifi which is essential with 2 teenagers. Only pain being you have to re-enter your details every 24 hours. Note that it doesn't work in the restaurant downstairs nor do they have wifi there at all. The lifts are the biggest issue for the hotel and you can wait ages despite there being 3. Take the stairs down to avoid long waits.\nThe restaurant recommendations received when we checked in we're quite good and give you a starting point. Plenty of options a close walk away and would recommend the Murray Hill diner over Scottys for breakfast.\nAll in all a good location as a base to explore and has all you need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:52:44.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
