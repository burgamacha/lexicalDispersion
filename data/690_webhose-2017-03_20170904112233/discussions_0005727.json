We got a junior suite, it wasn't a big room, but it was efficient space for two people with two big pieces of luggage, we had them set in a way that they didn't get in our way at all. The bathroom had both a stand up shower and a bath tub, perfect size bathroom. The amenities were always replenished and nothing was missed or ignored (l'occitaine products). What I truly loved was two main things:\n1) The staff are unbeatable, super helpful. Always willing to do whatever you need without hesitation and are quick to do so. Hani and Emily specifically at the front desk are the sweetest. I once forgot the safe open in my room and it was wide open, and when I came back I realized that it was clear to the cleaners because they had replenished the tea in the same cupboard and nothing was touched in the safe. That really meant a lot to see :) Lovely and trustworthy staff.\n2) Nothing was forgotten or ignored, the towels are big and there was always enough, extra bathrooms, hotel slippers, assortment of tea, the replenished products everyday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:36:28.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
