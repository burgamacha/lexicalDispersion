We requested early check in at 12pm through the Marriott android app and were happy that they were able to accommodate our request when we arrived. Front desk rep was friendly and polite. If you're a Marriott rewards member and booking directly with them on their app it allows you to have free wifi. We stayed on the 25th floor with a slight view of the Hudson. Comfy beds/pillows, and clean room. It was a \"typical\" Marriott stay for me which I prefer. Pleasant and familiar. Being this was our first time in NYC this was supposed to be our base and we would just come back in the evening to sleep. But it was freezing during our stay below 20 degrees, so my kids needed more down time in the afternoon. Coming back to the our comfy \"home-tel\" (as they called it) room midday to warm up and recharge was nice. The downtown location for us was nice since we had tickets to see the Statue of Liberty and it's a very short walk to the Cruise Line.Within walking distance of 9/11 Museum, Freedom Tower, Trinity Church, Wall Street and easy subway ride to midtown. Location seemed very safe during the day and night. We enjoyed our stay.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:47:39.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
