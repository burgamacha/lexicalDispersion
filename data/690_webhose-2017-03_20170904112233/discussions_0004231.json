I had made a mistake when booking and only requested a room for 2 people, when there was 4 of us. When we got to the room, we realized the mistake, as there was only 1 large bed. I went down to the front desk to see if we could get a room with 2 double beds or 1 additional room. The staff was fantastic, they gave us a double room, on an upper flower with a great river view. They were so friendly and helpful. They kept our bags the next day after we checked out so we could explore prior to our flight. This was a very convenient location and easy access to many things in Manhattan. It is a long ride from JFK to here, so keep that in mind, to make sure you schedule time good. It was over an hour trip on the shuttle (book your own shuttle) one way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:24:50.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
