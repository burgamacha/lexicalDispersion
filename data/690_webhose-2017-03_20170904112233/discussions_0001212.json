The staff is great, always offering friendly assistance and spot-on recommendations for nearby restaurants and attractions. The location is as \"New York\" as it gets, with the best food in the city just around the corner. Subway stations are also conveniently blocked within a few short. blocks. We were most surprised by how quiet and peaceful it was. Over the last few years, we've stayed in several NYC neighborhoods and always expect it to be loud. Not the case at NobleDEN! We slept great in a comfortable, clean room with almost no noise from the street or other guests.
