The staff were so helpful - recommended great restaurants and were very friendly and reliable. The room itself was so clean with a very comfortable bed. In terms of price, it was a little on the expensive side which is to be expected given the beautiful location ( a stone throw away from the Arc de Triomph, Champs Ã‰lysees). We walked everywhere because it was in such an excellent location with loads of local cafes and a fresh food market nearby. The hotel itself was on a pretty quiet street which is surprising given the noise and business in the area generally - but in the hotel there was no outside noise.\nI did hear some noise from the people who were next to us but I was on the sofa bed. In the bedroom, it's very quiet. I would really recommend this for business or pleasure, it's so clean and central, with all amenities you could need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:54:22.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
