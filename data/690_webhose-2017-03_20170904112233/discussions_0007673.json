It was so near everything and with a metro outside the door you can access the entire city.\nThe hotel itself was very clean, the rooms are a bit small but really well kept. The warm welcome we received from the girl we met on arrival was excellent and she had customer focused approach of a receptionist that wanted to help in every way giving us a map and how to get to nearby attractions.\nThe hotel is located in an area with lovely places within walking distance to eat and drink, I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:50:38.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
