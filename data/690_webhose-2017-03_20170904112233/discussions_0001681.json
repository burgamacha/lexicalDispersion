I'll be back. What a wonderful hotel. Not only was the room very clean and very comfortable, but the central (and historic) location was great for walking all over the city without having to always rely on public transportation. The breakfasts were also perfect. But the very best feature of the hotel was its staff. The women at the front desk could not have been more helpful and nice to us. They even took time to give us helpful tips when we asked for them. Staying at le Relais du Louvre made the trip perfect. We will be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:33:42.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
