Although far from main site-seeing attractions L1 metro around the corner made it easily accessible. The neighborhood is really nice and quite, lots of good places to eat, a Laundromat across the street, metro stop around the corner, and a convenient supermarket 2 mins away. The staff was really friendly and helpful with directions and everything in general. I will definitely go back to this hotel, and will recommend it 100%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:58:40.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
