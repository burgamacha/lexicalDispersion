Nothing felt like it was to much trouble. We were upgraded for free to one of the best rooms in the hotel and it was an amazing room. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable especially for someone 6'4 who is used to his feet sticking out the end of the bed lol.\nWhen I return to Paris I will only stay at this hotel as it's head and shoulders above other hotels in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:19:36.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
