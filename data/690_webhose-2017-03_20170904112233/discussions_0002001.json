Having no real idea what to expect on my first visit to Paris, this hotel made it easy with a great location, easy access to restaurants, shops and site seeing. The front of the hotel is also very accessible for pickups for organized shuttles and tours.\nThe room was very clean & comfortable with good air conditioning and the free wifi worked well. My room was very quiet which was great for a good nights sleep.\nIf there was a negative, it would be the shower over the bath with the glass screen and leaking water although I didn't let this ruin my stay.\nEnjoyed my stay and would happily return to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:50:38.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
