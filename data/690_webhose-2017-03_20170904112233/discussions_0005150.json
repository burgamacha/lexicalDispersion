The rooms have a lot of character and pay much attention to detail. The furnishings are quirky ( night tables don't match and there is a beautiful armoire in each room) . Lamps all have dimmer switches and you can play your own music from your smartphone using the top quality Bluetooth speakers. Marble tiled bathrooms have rain showers and heavenly toiletries. There are two top quality European style restaurants in the hotel and a very hip bar. Juan and the free hotel car however blew us away. Going to a business meeting in Soho, the concierge recommended we take \"the Lexus Limo\" . We got there right on time and felt oh so special!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:44:20.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
