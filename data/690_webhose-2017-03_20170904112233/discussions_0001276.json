The hotel itself was beautiful and in a great location. We really enjoyed the happy hour in the lobby each afternoon which gave us the opportunity to meet and chat with different guests. The female bartender at the actual hotel bar was also extremely helpful. I found some members of the front desk staff to be difficult to deal with. The hotel 'held' $100 per night for incidentals on my credit card without this being mentioned to me at check-in. Additionally, I was charged an extra $200+ that no-one could explain to me, other than saying this too must have been a 'hold'. I felt patronised when I questioned this and was told they would look into it but nobody got back to me. It is pure speculation but I do wonder if they would've treated an older person (I am in my 20s) with the same level of disinterest and annoyance as they treated me. I would definitely stay again, but I would hope the front desk staff would be a little more helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:37:37.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
