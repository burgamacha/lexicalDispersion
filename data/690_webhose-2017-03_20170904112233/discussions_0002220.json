I found La Villa Saint Germain while doing an internet search. I was impressed with all of the reviews and decided to check this place out for myself.\nI must say, we were not disappointed. What a lovely piece of heaven! We found the staff to be extremely accommodating and friendly. A few times, they were kind enough to assist us with directions, dinner reservations, and wonderful recommendations. We reserved the package with the car pick up from the airport… we were delighted to find our driver waiting for us just outside of customs upon our arrival. The hotel staff accommodated our request for an early check in, which allowed us to rest and freshen up before heading out to explore the City of Lights.\nOur room was on the larger size, considering the standard Paris Hotel Room. We did book the Club Twin room. Our bathroom was on the somewhat smaller size, but very nice. The shower was always hot and the pressure was perfect. Our room #21, was on the second floor. The room was a tad warm, but cooled nicely when we opened the window. The noise was loud, at times… but not so loud you couldn’t rest, properly.\nWe were delighted with the evening turn down service… a very pleasant surprise, complete with fresh towels!\nYou simply cannot beat the location, the staff, and the value. We highly recommend staying here, and we look forward to a return visit!\nRoom Tip: Our room was on the larger size. We did book the Club Twin room.
