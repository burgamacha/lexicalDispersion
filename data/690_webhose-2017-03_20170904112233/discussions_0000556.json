While this is wonderful hotel...great neighborhood feel, wonderful restaurants that you can walk too, spectacular views of the Eiffel Tour, many English tv channels... it does have it's draw backs. Room size was nice. The bed was lush and comfortable but to enter our room, you had to step into the bathroom to be able to close the door for entry. They should invest in some WD40 or the French equivalent. Doors are extremely loud and squeaky. You should also know that if the front desk calls a taxi for you, you will be charged an additional 4 Euros for the service, which would be fine if it was told to you when it is offered by desk attendant. You can walk to the corner and it won't cost you a thing.\nThat being said, it would not stop us from staying there again. We would just be more aware of extended services.\nRoom Tip: Higher floor rooms have a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:54:06.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
