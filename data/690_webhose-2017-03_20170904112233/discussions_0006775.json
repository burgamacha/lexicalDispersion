It is within walking distance of more major attractions than you could visit in a month, let alone a few days. It is also within walking distance of The Tube, of course, and had a plenitude of bus stops if you prefer to stay above ground. The number of restaurants nearby will boggle the mind...go on that diet BEFORE you get here! This location is the beating heart of the city. But cities can be noisy, right? No problem at The Trafalgar...the rooms are all completely soundproof, with double glass windows! Also, this is the only hotel in the Hilton chain without a brand designation, so you may not realize that it is a Hilton hotel. The only complaint we have is that the hotel was undergoing renovation in the lobby during our stay, which we did not know when we made the reservation...they should have told us that. Otherwise, a wonderful place to enjoy London!\nRoom Tip: The best views are of Trafalgar square, and no worries about noise, so enjoy!
