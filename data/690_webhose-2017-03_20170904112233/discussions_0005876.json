When we checked in we were told that due to some work being done on other rooms we would had been upgraded for one night but would have to move rooms the next day. Luckily we ended up being able to stay in the upgraded room for our entire visit. The hotel was extremely clean which is a big plus and I really liked the feel of the rooms with the funky wallpaper. The room we were upgraded to was huge especially for New York standards. The only reason I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars is that I feel like they should definitely advertise that there is no door to the bathroom which is a little awkward if you're not traveling with someone you are extremely close to. I would definitely say this a great hotel for a romantic getaway, but not good for a family vacation. The pool area can definitely get a little more than PG-13. Overall a great experience and would definitely stay again, but not for a family vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:57:53.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
