I can't imagine a more perfect location in London. It is 5-10 minutes walking distance from the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Courtauld Museum, the Royal Festival Hall, Trafalgar Square, and to almost every theater in the West End. It is one block from the Embankment Tube station and one block from the Thames. It is surrounded by restaurants, small grocery stores, and other useful shops, 15 minute walk to Parliament, Westminster Abbet, and the Churchill War Rooms. The room I had was very comfortable, the bed and bedding was cozy and comfy. The hotel's policy that the minibar is free is lovely. The breakfast is worth including in your room rate. It is ample and of excellent quality, and you can set yourself up for the day by eating a solid breakfast there before you go out and make it most of the day without having to eat again.\nThe staff: possibly the most welcoming, warm, and helpful staff I have encountered in a life time of travel. I would like to signal and thank particularly Lotte and Hayley at the front desk, Vinnie, Duane, and Thijs at the concierge desk, and Miguel and Sinan the hotel managers. That I know their names speaks to how thoughtful and helpful they were.\nAs to rooms, I was on the 5th floor facing the Strand, which is a very busy street. There was street noise till about 11pm, but it did not ever bother me. There are also music buskers with amplifiers most nights, but they stop by 10-11pm. The view from my room was wonderful, looking over St, Martin's of the Field Church.\nI recommend this hotel very strongly.\nRoom Tip: High floor, (5th or 6th. Rooms that do not face the Strand are quieter. But no nice view.
