The hotel was nice and whilst the rooms are small as many have mentioned before, you just make do and make the best of it. The staff were great and the room was clean and perfect for our needs. We were on the 18th floor and had a great view of the New York skyline. Would recommend the Izakaya Mew Japanese restaurant which was on the same block, one street down. Difficult to find as in a basement but worth the hunt. Probably one of our best ever meals, amazing! One slight issue was being charged the wrong rate on checking in. Having booked on booking.com with an excellent rate, we were charged the full rate but luckily noticed. What out for that one! All in all a great hotel in midtown and ideal for a weekend break in the Big Apple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:37:52.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
