The room was smaller (which can be expected at many boutique hotels), but everything about the place was great. It was modern, phenomenal wi-fi, comfortable beds, excellent service and facilities.\nAll in all, if we ever come back to London, we WILL be staying here. Other benefits were:\n- Close access to London's underground rail system with a station located right around the corner from the place. It makes it really easy to get to all the attractions with a quick train ride.\n- Within a 5 minute walk, there is a massive mall and excellent movie theater. While we weren't in London for the shopping or mall food, they did have an excellent selection of both which was nice when we wanted a quick and easy bite to eat.\n- If you want a quiet room, get one that's not facing the road. It wasn't overly noisy, but there is a lot of construction happening around the city (including this area as well).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:24:49.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
