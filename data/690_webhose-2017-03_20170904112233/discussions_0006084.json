I was not familiar with Kerry or Shangri-la properties, so it was all new to me.\nThe atmosphere - room, public rooms, employees, the fresh flowers daily, were all first class. The buffet offering for breakfast and dinner were extensive (both western and local foods) and well done.\nThe room was spacious,clean and modern. Service was prompt and friendly.\nAll in all, it was a very pleasant experience and I look forward to another stay at another Kerry hotel in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:48:43.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
