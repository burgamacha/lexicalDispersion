Even though the hotel is 5* its not the same standard as a UK 5* in comparison its more of a shabby chic old vintage style boutique hotel, rooms are nice with comfy beds, very clean , however no kettle or tea making facilities .. decor is a bit dated but still a very comfortable stay :) Best bit is the location its very central and 5 mins walk to Champs Elysee's with a 30 min walk to the Eiffel Tower.\nOverall a good experience , would definitely go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:02:33.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
