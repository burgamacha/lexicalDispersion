First stay was in 2011, this was my second visit to The Surrey.\nLikes: Spacious rooms, especially by New York City standards, fashionably decorated, luxury linens, top shelf Diptyque bath products, comfortable bed, great service, great neighborhood.\nDislikes: Morning coffee lovers beware: NO in room coffee maker, and room service coffee for two will cost you $26 for a pot with barely enough coffee for two cups. Starbucks is 5 blocks away. The upscale neighborhood has more limited dining options than other neighborhoods in NYC.\nIf Times Square and being in the middle of NYC is your thing, this is not the hotel for you. If you like easy access to Central Park, museums, and designer boutiques in a lovely neighborhood then The Surrey is a wonderful choice. Coffee lovers, you've been warned!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on the higher floors.
