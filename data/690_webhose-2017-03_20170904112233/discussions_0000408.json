We were in a pickle when we got to Beijing with the credit card used for the booking left behind at home but the staff came thru helping us and honoring all the reservations commitments, that is called service. Second in our opinion only to the Oberoi hotels, the staff is very welcoming, always eager to assist and engage in a conversation, go above and beyond to ensure you feel comfortable - special shout outs to Lynn, Jeremy, Bryan, & Oscar. The concierge desk overall is exceptional.\nThe room was large with good views and the free upgrade helped. It is a typical 4-seasons classy room with everything thought of; from the comfy bed, to the powder room and the coffee. I am more of a boutique hotel kind of person but the staff here changed that for me. China is changing fast and our family had a fun filled vacation here. Hope to come back soon and experience 4-seasons again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:09:10.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
