The staff were extremely welcoming, and the place is a charming boutique hotel. The front desk staff had a bowl of clementines at hand--a very thoughtful and energizing gesture. The view from the windows could be better, but then again, who spends time looking out a hotel window when there is so much to do in this city? The room was a bit small compared to what you see in chain hotels, but very comfortable, a restful haven after a busy day. I loved that there was a tub, not just a shower. My one complaint was that the items on the minibar were a bit pricey; fortunately, there are plenty of other snack/drink options right down the block. I don't get to travel much, and this felt like luxurious getaway, some \"me\" time, even though it was for business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:01:01.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
