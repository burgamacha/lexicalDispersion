I booked this hotel as a package through Virgin, it is one of their Premier range. We had an upgrade to a room with 2 queen beds at no extra cost which was a great start to the holiday. On the 18th floor, we enjoyed peace from the busy city below. The beds were super comfy and much needed after a busy day seeing the sights. We had too. SeI vice the first night â‚¬75 dollars for 2 x pizza, chips and soft drinks was a bit pricey but as I learned over the next few days, everything is expensive, partly due to the low dollar/pound exchange. We ate at 2 of the restaurants and highly recommend both. When you first enter this hotel there is a lovely buzzy atmosphere and great welcome from the staff. Hotel is great location in mid town Manhattan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:46:24.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
