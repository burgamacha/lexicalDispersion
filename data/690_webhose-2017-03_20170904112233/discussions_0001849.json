Easy walk to the subway. Surprisingly quiet considering the location. Rooms are small but perfectly functional. We had a king bed with single bunk above which was very comfortable for us and fun for our daughter. Rooms were very clean. The bathroom was fairly spacious and very clean. The rooms tend to be on the darker side but funky. The views were just of another hotel and office building across the street but you could see the paramount building. The bar/lounge was very fun and funky for adults to have a cocktail and the pool was great for kids and adults on the cold, snowy days we had in NYC. There is also a sauna to warm up and relax in. The breakfast was a reasonable price and enough food to keep you going until dinner. They have a great coffee machine with espresso, latte and cappuccino options. Also, the Cranberry Cafe is a couple of doors down from the hotel and they have a lot of breakfast, lunch and dinner options at a reasonable price that you can get to go or stay and eat upstairs. The hotel staff were very friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you want something a little different and want somewhere you can easily get to all the attractions. Would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:57:56.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
