It is a historical monument.\nThe main weakness of the hotel is their room. They are not st the level of a such palace. The rooms are equivalent to 4stars hotel.\nThe service of reception is weak .\n-However the day team of concierges are excellent. The chief Toni is highly qualified.\nBastien , Julien and Anthony are excellent concierges\nThe main strength of this hotel is the food they offer in their restaurants\nI have tried la Bauhimia where you take your breakfastexcell\nThey offer a very nice choice of asiatic and French dishes.\nValue for money is in their restaurants.\nThe executive Chef Moret prepare an excellent sole and Burrata\nThe asiatic restaurant Shang Palace has a one star at Michelin guide. You should try the crispy duck.\nFinally the spa is wonderful.\nSuperb pool with view.\nThe masseur Fernando is excellent and very funny.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:20:46.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
