The property was centrally located near Victoria on Buckingham Palace Road. We were greeted with champagne upon arrival and the staff took the extra effort to get to know us and our plans for our brief stay. We very much enjoyed our English breakfast each morning and canapes in the evening. We were also greeted with a thoughtful congratulatory cake and card in our room to celebrate our recent engagement. We will refer all of our friends to 41 in the future! Many thanks! - Brian Safran\nRoom Tip: You can't go wrong with your room at 41.
