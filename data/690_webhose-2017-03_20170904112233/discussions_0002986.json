The staff is nice, and everyone we talked to spoke English, so that helped out a lot. The breakfast is well stocked, clean and everything tasted great. Although a little bit away from all the famous monuments, the Metro station is on all 3 sides of the streets, so it's very convenient. All in all, a good place to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:56:37.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
