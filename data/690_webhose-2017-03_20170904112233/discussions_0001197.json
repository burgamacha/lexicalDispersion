I am very happy I chose Melia Vendôme.\nThe location is just perfect, it is in the heart of Paris, close to everything but at the same time the property was very quiet. The room is very nice with a comfortable bed so we were able to rest well.\nThe staff always pleasantly greeted us every time we passed the lobby, which was very nice.. I felt like they were making efforts to make guests' stay pleansent and comfortable.\nThey also work well in team so if something comes up during the night, they share about it with their colleagues who work in the morning.\nThank you and we would definitely come back on our next visit!\n母にとって初めてのパリだったので、ホテル選びに気を使いましたがMelia Vendômeにして正解でした。お部屋もロケーションも良かったです。スタッフの方も挨拶をきちんとしてくれますし、接客に関して努力しているように見受けられました。また次も泊まりたいです。", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:50:02.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
