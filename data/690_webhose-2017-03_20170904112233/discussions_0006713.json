Just a few minutes walk to the theater district, Times Square, or north to Lincoln Center. The neighborhood is a little quieter and safer than right in Times square, but close enough proximity for ease of access. We have stayed at this hotel several times, and it's always been pretty good. The breakfast room on the third floor and restaurant on the fourth floor are very nice atmospheres overlooking the city streets, and the view from the 35th floor gym is wonderful. The Residence inn is from the 35th floor and above, on top of the Courtyard by Marriott. The rooms are generally clean, although this last time we became very allergic in our room. There may have been a pet that was not thoroughly cleaned up after. The service was generally good, except when we arrived and the system was down and we were not able to check into our room. We had to leave our bags so we could make our evening appointment, and when we returned to check in around 11 PM our original room request was no longer available. The staff did eventually move us to our desired room a couple days later. There was mold on the shower curtain in the bathroom, but the staff replaced this upon request. The Wi-Fi is consistent in my experience. The location is really what makes this hotel worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:36.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
