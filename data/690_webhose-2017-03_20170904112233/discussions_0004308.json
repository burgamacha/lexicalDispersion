Sits on top of a natural hot spring and there is spa services and hot pools in the basement (charge) Always very busy especially the 24 hr bar / restaurant. Check-in fast and multi-lingual. Taxis in the morning can be difficult to get.\nSubway is at the door and 1 stop to Beijing Railway station.\nHave been upgraded on all stays and accessed the lounge in the front building. Smaller (yet quieter) breakfast and good selection of drinks at the cocktail hour (or 2)\nGreat value in Beijing. If you are on a budget, like a spacious room in a 4 star hotel - then this is a good choice.\nI often walk 20 minutes down to Tienanmen Square for exercise. Small shops next door and some great food at the local Chinese restaurant on the premises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:48:02.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
