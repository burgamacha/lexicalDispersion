We loved our first stay there in 2011 and since the TA reviews were just as strong in 2017, I booked this latest trip without hesitation.\nI do a lot of research for trips to Europe. I do not want to fly 4,000 miles from Chicago to stay at a hotel that could be in any big city in the world. I want a \"pinch me, I am in London vibe.\" The Kensington has that British, cozy feel - several small fireplace sitting areas, fresh flowers, beautiful town home. Fulll English breakfast, perfect location in South Kensington.\nIn addition to the immaculate property, large - very quiet - room and wonderful food, we experienced stellar service from booking room (Anna P. in reservations), to the concierge service (Martyn, you are a gem!) to the wait staff at the hotel breakfast (Sandor). What a great trip - thank you Kensington!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:24:04.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
