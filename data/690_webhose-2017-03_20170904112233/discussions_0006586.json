It was a short walk from Victoria Tube Station and close to several food shops and places to eat.\nCheck-in and out were efficient and friendly.\nThe room was clean and comfortable. Having the bed pushed against the wall was a bit awkward, but it's difficult to see what other arrangement was possible, given the size of the room. Having window blinds rather than curtains meant that we were woken by the daylight, which wasn't completely blocked out. However, it was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in when in London.\nThe surrounding area is currently being developed, so navigating your way round can be a bit tricky. We weren't disturbed by the noise though.\nI'd stay here again (if I could afford it).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:06:00.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
