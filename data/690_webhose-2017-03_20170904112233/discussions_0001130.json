The service we received from the moment we arrived until we left was absolutely perfect. We arrived early for check in so assumed we would leave our luggage there and check in later, instead they offered for us to check in early and wait only 10 minutes during which time they served us drinks and coffee's, they also brought activity bags out for our children. One of our children had been too ill to come along but they still brought an activity bag for us to take home to her. The suite's here are huge, we have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotel suites and this is by far the largest, we stayed in the 3 bedroom Minsters which overlooked the little square, it was beautiful and perfect for families. The doormen all knew us by name when we returned from our day out in London and even teased the children that there was a surprise for them in the room, they had brought up cookies with our children names on them. It was so lovely and really thoughtful. The check in is a sit down affair which is become more and more common in 5 star hotels. We used the valet parking, the butlers are really helpful and you don't have to wait for anything, they are there really quickly. I would recommend this hotel and I know for sure we will be returning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:02:31.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
