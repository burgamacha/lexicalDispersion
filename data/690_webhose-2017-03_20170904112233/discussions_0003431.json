We stayed here for 8 days and never wanted to leave the hotel. Its not supper huge but not small. A perfect size and even when super full you don't feel its busy. Very elegant in design and luxury. Everyone is always smiling and just want to help what ever the request is.\nTheir Concierge is the best one i ever had pleasure to work with. They are yet to say no and they made things happen for us. With its getting a booking a trendy place or finding specific cream around paris. They would even buy the thing u need and just bill the room buck for buck. Thanks for all your help.\nWe also had our wedding here and banquet team did a superb job and worked well with super stressful clients and our last minute changes.\nFood was s divine no plate was ever returned empty. Even cups and plates were so elegant wither ur in the resturant or room service. Only saw it in a hand full of hotels world wide not even shangri la hong kong would do this.\nThank u all from management to teams for making it a memorable experience. U truly r the best shangri la and the best hotel in paris.\nMerci", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:07:45.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
