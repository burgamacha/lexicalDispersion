The hotel is converted from an old school so it has character and charm.\nWe received a warm welcome on arrival and the room was clean, comfortable and well maintained.\nOur room number was 24. It wasn't a huge room but it was perfect as a double. There was a high window, so no view, but it meant it was lovely and quiet. The bathroom had under floor heating which was a nice touch, but there was no bath. This however, did not bother us as the shower was lovely.\nWe had cocktails in the bar downstairs which were excellent. The service was very good.\nLocation was good for us. Ten minute walk from the station in one direction and ten minute walk to the exhibition centre (which was the reason for our trip) in the other direction.\nI would recommend this hotel to a friend and definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:05:14.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
