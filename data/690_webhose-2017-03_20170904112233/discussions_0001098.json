The staff were very friendly, cheerful and helpful. Special mention to Ahmed who was very welcoming and Toofik too. The room was very clean and well looked after and had the added bonus of a safe and a fridge. We had a superior room which had a bath as well as a shower. The hotel is superbly situated and is within walking distance (10 mins) to Gare de Nord (for Eurostar) Also very close to Gare de L'Est and Jacques Bonsergent metro station. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby and also a small supermarket in the same road. A great hotel for the price bracket. If we visit Paris again would definitely want to stay at Hotel Soft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:26:20.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
