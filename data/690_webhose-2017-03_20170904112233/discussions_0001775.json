Towels changed everyday if required and beds made etc. Breakfast was always stocked up and the fresh orange machine was a nice touch.\nStaff were very friendly and accommodating - big thanks for having us 15 Scots staying with you!! (we loved the photos you took of us on game day!!)\nThe hotel is well situated, we walked to most of the tourist spots and there is also metro's very close by, including a supermarket across the road.\nVery well priced and good services. Thanks again for having us. Would stay again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:13:56.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
