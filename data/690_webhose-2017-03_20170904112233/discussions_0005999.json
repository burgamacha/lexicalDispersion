I cannot say enough about the hotel and its staff. We decided to take the ahuttle room ended by the hotel. It was $75 (a taxi would have cost about $55), but it was well worth it. The driver greeted us right at the gate and took great care of us.\nWe arrived at the hotel. Right away greetings and smiles from the staff, a Jean Belmondo room on the 6th overlooking the city, with a little sitting area and balcony. We were given a lovely box of chocolates and we partook of the daily complimentary patisserie and coffe and soft drink service. We were given excellent recommendations for dinner and directions as well.\nCan't wait for breakfast in the morning!\nMerci beaucoup. Such a wonderful start to our vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:45:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
