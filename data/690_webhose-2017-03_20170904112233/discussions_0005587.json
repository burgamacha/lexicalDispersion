Hotel is beautiful, as you would expect from the Peninsula group. Situated on Ave Kleber, just a short walk from the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe\nGreat facilities - incredible in room amenities, everything from the lights,curtains to the TV controlled from a tablet - bathrooms are spectacular. One of the few luxury hotels that has a pool. The staff were exceptional, nothing is too much trouble to ensure your stay in Paris is a memorable one. The breakfast in Le lobby restaurant was something to look forward to each day, and dinner at the rooftop restaurant L'oiseau Blanc was superb . Will certainly return next time we're in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:35:21.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
