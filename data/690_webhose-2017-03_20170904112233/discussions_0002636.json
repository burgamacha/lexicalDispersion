The breakfast is very good and the hotel has always snacks and bottled water available (and it's all included!). We also enjoyed a lot the wine reception that happens everyday at evenings.\nThe location is also perfect if you will use the subway, the Times Sq station (which connects all the important lines in Manhattan) is really near. And being pratically into the Times Square helps a lot when you need something.\nThe room was always clean and well prepared and it's silent and comfortable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:51:02.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
