There really is something to please everyone. I traveled with my adult children and celebrated their birthday there. I emailed the hotel before our stay before and was looked after by Melissa, as a surprise she arranged for gluten free birthday cakes and for happy birthday to be sung by the lovely staff at Eight restaurant (fantastic food btw). Melissa also arranged for our 3 rooms to be side by side. The rooms were great, I just wished I had booked sooner as would have like a river view room which was sold out.\nI think we used all the facilities between us, but wished we had stayed longer to use them even more. We had lovely walks in their huge grounds, used the pool, had a massage with the lovely friendly beauticians, the eagles encounter, wine tasting and segway tour of the farm which was such fun. Breakfast was lovely, a huge choice and open until 11.00. The 2 restaurants we tried were both excellent. Staff were all really friendly and helpful. We will back next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:33:59.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
