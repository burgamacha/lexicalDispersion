This hotel certainly had some funky design features from big pink lip shaped pillows to a big red light for the room. (why???) Outside of the trendy design features, the hotel was still functional and comfortable. The staff was really friendly and i felt like they were available for anything i may need, but not in an overbearing way. The room was clean, quiet and the beds comfortable. The location was fantastic, i had never stayed int he east village before and i really enjoyed it. I will definitely be staying here again when in NYC and am looking forward to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:55:29.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
