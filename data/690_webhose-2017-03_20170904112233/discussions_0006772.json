Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to the door of the Ampersand is perfect. The hotel is also only a stone's throw from the Natural History Museum and the V&A.\nThe welcome at the hotel was genuine and warm and I was met not only with a smile but an upgrade to very comfortable and tastefully decorated room. I was also invited to have a glass of champagne in the cocktail lounge at my convenience - did they know it was my Birthday! The breakfast was more than adequate and the service exemplary. My only disappointment, my stay was too short.
