For the price I paid it was up to my expectations. They also do a nice wine tasting in the evening for guests, free coffee and tea in the lobby.\nThe pillows on the bed also let you choose between different firmness levels.\nBefore arrival (I guess only if you book direct) they also send you a questionnaire to prepare for your stay.\nWhat I didn't like:\nThe shower curtain was really a bit short, taking a shower means the floor gets soaked. Despite the room being cozy, I think it would be pretty cramped for two people. The lift is also tiny so don't expect to go up together including all your luggage, and in fact don't take too much luggage at all because there isn't much storage in the room.\nThere were some weird stains in the ceiling in the room just in front of the bathroom (room 504) but overall the room was really clean. I am just really tall so I see it easily.\nThe hotel had a quirky vibe to it with non stop jazz music in the public areas, and I felt very much at home. I'd come again if I had to visit this area of paris.\nThe theme is from Boris Vain who is a famous French jazz musician, so the cocktail piano in the lobby is from one of his books.
