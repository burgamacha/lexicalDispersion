We had a king room on the 45th floor with a nice view of the Hudson river. As others have stated, the rooms are on the small side, but perfectly adequate for our needs. The bathroom is very tiny with no counter space at all for toiletries, but we managed o.k.\nHousekeeping kept our room spotless and we were fortunate not to have had any real issues with the elevator service, but that may be just down to luck.\nThe hotel is situated close to the 911 Memorial and One World tower. It is steps from a subway station and the Battery Park ferry stations. Any staff we dealt with were extremely helpful. We tried the St. George Tavern next door and were very happy with it.\nWe would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will probably use it again on our next visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:27:42.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
