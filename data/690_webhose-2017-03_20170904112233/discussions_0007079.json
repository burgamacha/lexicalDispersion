The double tree was absolutely amazing! Granted we're in the middle of a winter vortex so timing was off due to cold weather but staying at the double tree worked out because it's right in the middle of everything! So walking to everything with toddlers was a breeze! And the staff literally goes out their way to help in any way they can making me feel like I was a VIP guest! We asked for a recommendation on a breakfast place, and the lady at the concierge (African American lady with the short haircut) literally wrote down restaurants, their addresses and in order to distance and price range! Amazing!!! Everytime we came back to the hotel Kevin opened the door with a smile and said welcome back ladies. Just the overall customer service was amazing!!! I'll definitely be returning to the double tree for future trips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:38:02.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
