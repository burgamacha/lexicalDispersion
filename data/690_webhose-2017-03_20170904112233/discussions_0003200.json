We booked a suite with them which consisted of a large living room, a bedroom, a bathroom with a toilet/sink, and a bathroom with a shower/sink. The divider between the bedroom and living room can be closed for privacy and the hotel had already made up the couch and pullout trundle (twin size beds) for our friends.\nThe room came with breakfast which was okay (nothing great but not bad).\nThe hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.\nThe location was fantastic. Paris is very walkable and the location is in the heart of Paris on a somewhat quiet street but only a short walk to a lot of the sites.\nOverall, we were amazed at the price given the location. We'd definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:53:59.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
