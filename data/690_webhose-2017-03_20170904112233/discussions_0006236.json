Its greatest strength is the very helpful and pleasant staff, everybody from the reception staff to the bartenders. The hotel is quite small, which is not a bad thing. The location is not perfect. It is close to the Eiffel Tower, but far away from the city centre (Louvre, Place Vendome, Opera, the shopping streets, etc). The reference to the Champs-Elysees is misleading. It must be about 2 km to the C-E. I stayed at the hotel together with a group of colleagues for three weeks on a business trip. The location was great for our business locations, but I would definitely choose another hotel for a leisure trip. The rooms are small. The bathrooms are very stylish but the rooms themselves will soon need a facelift. Some of the rooms (including the conference rooms in the basement) has a clear smell of fungus. Will need remedial work. All in all a nice hotel with very nice staff, but not five stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:27:59.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
