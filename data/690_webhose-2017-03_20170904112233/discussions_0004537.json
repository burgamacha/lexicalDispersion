My first impression of the service was excellent. I flew into London early on a Friday morning. I had a work meeting and was able to drop my bags at the hotel, use a room to freshen up and change and then proceed to my meeting. My room and luggage was all set when I returned in the late afternoon. The service here sets the place apart. I met my college age son in London for a Chelsea match over the weekend. The staff put Chelsea jerseys in our room for fun. Very nice touch! All of the staff are attentive without being meddling. The executive lounge is lovely and comfortable. The rooms and bath facilities are excellent. I will definitely visit again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:54:26.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
