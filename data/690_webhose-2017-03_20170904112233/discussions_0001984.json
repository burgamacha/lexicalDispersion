Very spacious and clean rooms. Book the Residence Club room so that you can have access to the Residence club where they have beverages, hot drinks, and snacks for free. As soon as I arrived to the hotel I felt home with the warm welcoming of the staff and immediately offered me a free room upgrade.The staff in the hotel and specially in the Residence club were amazing specially Steven (thank you Steven). The facilities are excellent and the location is close by the majority of attractions. Next time I fly to Beijing , no need to search for hotels as I know already where I'm going to be staying.\nRoom Tip: Residence Club See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:24:19.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
