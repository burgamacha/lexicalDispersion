I understand it was on the market at the time, and, like an old vintage artefact, waiting to be restored to the glory such a wonderful place deserved. Indeed, just look at it now! Simply put, a Pride of the Cape! The Hotel accommodation is so comfortable and My wife and I were very grateful for the magnificent Suite 602 we had the privilege of staying the weekend. Each and every staff member is worthy of high praise and are a credit to Spier. Staff and owners are an excellent team ! Scenic beauty abounds, fabulous walks, interesting and reasonably priced wine tastings, interesting curio market...I could go on and on. I must mention the fabulous ladies who manage and serve at the cosy great value Eight Farm Restaurant . They were so kind to us and helped my wife and I celebrate the 44th anniversary of the day we met. You must order their Beef burger, the best! Spier wines on the list are terrific value. Then there is the restful, clean and beautiful swimming pool area with cold lemon, strawberry or cucumber water to quench a summer thirst . Breakfasts are included, be prepared for a hearty SA meal and try the complimentary barista coffees. I better stop....to conclude, many thanks All at Spier, well done and all best for your onward success. We ,as South Africans living in the UK, head back to London with great memories of just how excellent a standard you have achieved since the rebirth at Spier.\nRoom Tip: 602 amazing!
