It's located Ina lively part of the city with lots of eating options of all price ranges nearby. The rooms are actually a good size by New York standards & spotlessly clean. The staff are a credit to the brand too, I had a couple of technical issues with my tv & safe & they sent someone within 10 mins & he fixed everything. The walls are a little thin but I was lucky to stay mid week so no other guests were having parties sets so it was pretty quiet. I really can not recommend the hotel enough, especially for the price. If I had to give a negative it's that there is no refrigerator in the room (but have ice vending machines) but maybe that's an American thing, not just this hotel. I plan on making this my future base for all New York visits. Thank you!\nGreen Features: Towel & linen conservation, but a lot of plastic used on cups etc...better to have cups/glasses & wash them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:16:42.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
