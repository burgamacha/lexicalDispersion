Nothing was too much trouble from front of house to housekeeping. The staff presented us with a surprise bouquet of Roses,chocolates and chocolate Strawberries as it was our 49th wedding anniversary on visit.\nRoom was great, comfortable and quiet and well supplied with tea, coffee, milk and fruit etc. and even had television in the marble covered bathroom.\nFood was well prepared and served with style in the dining area. We had afternoon tea booked to celebrate our aniversary and there was more food than we could eat, all served by attentive staff.\nThe best hotel we have ever stayed in. Would we go back? Yes definitely. A more than five star experience.\nRoom Tip: Any room would be good in hotel. All are quiet and there is no noise from the lift or AC unit.
