The hutong is only a few minutes walk from the metro and about 10 minutes walk to the shopping & pedestrian walking street. We were upgraded to a premium room and had plenty of room including a balcony & sitting area overlooking the courtyard which would be wonderful to utilise in the warmer months. Breakfast was lovely a chef on hand to prepare eggs etc but also on hand were the usual Chinese breakfast dishes along with fruits, pasteries etc. The staff were outstanding could not fault anyone we encountered, exceptionally friendly & provided plenty of transport & helpful hints with patience & grace.\nThe bathroom was in need of a bit of a tidy up shower a bit dodgy & maybe a good spring clean to the bathroom is all that's needed however, don't let this put you off because our stay was fantastic, would we go back.
