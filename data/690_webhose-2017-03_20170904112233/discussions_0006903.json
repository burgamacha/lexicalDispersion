A bit disappointed this trip with the customer service\n2 nights after working all day came back to an unmade room and had to call for service. This was at 5:30 which when discussing this with the front desk I was told that this was standard\nNot sure they would have ever come had I not called. Next night same thing... waiting in the lobby after a long day. About 10 minutes after my room was cleaned someone knocked on the door for turndown service!!! One night turn down service at 10pm ....something is off\nI left a small item in the room and called from the airport and they are charging me a service fee plus the shipping fees.\nThe $400 plus per night room was dark and faced other customers rooms which made it difficult to get light. All in all not what I experienced last visit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:53:44.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
