I love the interiors, and the lounge area and restaurant is so cozy and casual and makes you feel at home immediately. The staff are so helpful and friendly and are all fluent in English which helps a lot! The food menu is perfect as it is simple and deslicious without trying too hard and the selection of wines compliment it perfectly. The rooms are beautifully decorated and equipped with all you need, especially love that you can have delicious nespresso in your room! The bathroom is stylish and functional and the overall in room experience is perfect! Can't wait to return, even if it's just for a cheese platter and a glass of wine in the calm lounge space! Thanks to COQ (community of queen) for creating such a wonderful experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:35:35.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
