Given that, and the fact that no one really goes on vacation to Rome for the hotel room, it was fine and I'd recommend it.\nThe downsides were that the bed covers smelled a bit, the water temperature didn't stay consistent in the shower, and the staff wasn't overly friendly. The hotel is a little run down.\nMy suggestion is to not stay on the 3rd floor (specifically in 306 where we were) because it's next door to the breakfast room and it's quite loud with banging around for setup in the morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:05:44.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
