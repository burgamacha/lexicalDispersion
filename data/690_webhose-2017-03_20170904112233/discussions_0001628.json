Our 3 night trip to Paris was to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. We were joined for the weekend by two of our French friends who were to be our tour guides.\nFrom arrival until departure, everyone on the staff who we met were warm, friendly and very helpful. The hotel rooms were beautifully furnished and equipped. Although we did not eat breakfast in the hotel, we did reserve a parking space for our friends car. It was a secure parking space owned by the hotel and only 50 metres away in a separate building. The parking fee was worth it as everything was so secure overnight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:32:50.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
