We were able to have the triple room and for 3 adults provided plenty of room.\nThe bathroom is large and modern and always spotlessly clean. Lovely towels and toiletries.\nThe lift is old and small so I would avoid if you don't like lifts.\nThe staff are very friendly and you only have to ask if you need anything.\nThe fee wifi was excellent and fast.\nThe location is excellent and there are many restaurants nearby.\nI would definitely stay at this hotel again and thank them for a very pleasant stay.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:43:47.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
