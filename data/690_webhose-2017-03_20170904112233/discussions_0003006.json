At the reception there was Ms. Silvia who really made sure we had everything we needed.\nThe hotel is well-furnished, clean and very cosy. Our room was excellent and we enjoyed it very much together with the breakfast, delicious and everyone ready to serve and make us feel very comfortable, not in an intrusive way but in a very \"Rome Life Hotel\" way.\nThe hotel is very well-located and well-connected with the main public transports in Rome. There is not far away the Episcopal Church, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Piazza Venezia.\nHighly recommended.\nMy girlfriend and I will surely book this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:46:57.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
