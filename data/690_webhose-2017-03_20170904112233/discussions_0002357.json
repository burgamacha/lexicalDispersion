The first time was in NÃ®mes. What I loved about both experiences was the serenity of the room. Excellent sound proofing, simple furnishings, and an extremely comfortable bed make for a welcome break from the intensity of touring a strange city, maybe getting caught in the rain (in Paris), getting lost and stumbling on wonderful experiences. I loved that at the end of the day I could return to my Ibis room and simply reflect. The rooms are cleverly designed to make good use of space, and the room was the same size as the one I had spent several nights in in a 4 star hotel costing double the price. The only difference was a smaller bathroom because the Ibis room has a shower only. It's a good one, and I always prefer a bath to a shower, but the great price and excellent location made up for no bath tub. Speaking of location, this hotel is within a short work of Bastille and a Metro station that will connect you to every other part of Paris. Across the street you'll find an excellent Italian restaurant serving the best wood-fired pizzas I've ever had, and at very modest prices. When this email arrived, I was on the Ibis website looking for the locations of other Ibis hotels, as I'm likely to plan another trip around Ibis. Seriously. I also love that they don't have any of that chintzy hotel art that so many hotels have or ugly attempts at decorating. Ibis is very zen, and I love that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:24:02.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
