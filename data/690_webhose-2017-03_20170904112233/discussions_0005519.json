The hotel is in a great location and although the room was quite small it was everything we needed! The customer service was what makes this hotel so good - when we arrived the gentleman on reception showed us where all nearby attractions were on the map and we were provided with a list of recommended restaurants - we tested 2 of these and they were great! The complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon were great after a long day exploring, and the complimentary glass of prosecco on my birthday was also very kind. This was our first visit to Rome but we plan on coming back and staying in this hotel again! Definitely recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:11:46.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
