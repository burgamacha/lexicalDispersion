I stayed for a week. It is really great. The people are friendly and efficient. The rooms are lovely and clean. Surprisingly quiet. Refrig in room. Short walk to see the Eiffel Tower. But the best view, IMHO, is when you go through shops on rue St. Dominique (one block away) and at a certain point in the curve of the street you see the Tower rising above like a dream. Love that! Le Petit Cler cafe is just across from you at this hotel. Food is good. Prices are good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:28:54.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
