This time we upgraded to a superior king. The room is still on the small side (certainly by US standards) but probably a good size for central London. The bed was massive. Good facilities and storage space. Small but well equipped bath and one of the best showers ever. We especially liked the daily supply of mineral water and cookies and the good cafetiere coffee. We booked in advance with the hotel and got what I feel was a good rate compared with rates I saw Quote: d closer to the date. Breakfast was not included but there are several good coffee houses nearby. While the hotel is in a quiet area of Mayfair the lively pubs and restaurants of Shepherds Market are hidden just a block away and two of London's best restaurants are just around the corner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:38:44.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
