As many other reviewers have described location is excellent and central. Staff are professional and helpful, rooms are very clean and had everything we needed. Linen and toiletries changed or replenished daily. Codes for 48 hours of free Wi-Fi were given and easily reissued. Breakfast was well-stocked; the boiled/scrambled eggs and bacon were a bonus! Super caf√© next door where we had a massive pizza prior to leaving. Our room on the 5th did not face onto a road and was very quiet. Would not hesitate to recommend and return.\nRoom Tip: 501 was quiet.
