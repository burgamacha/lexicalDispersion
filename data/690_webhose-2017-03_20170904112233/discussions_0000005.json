Enough room for 2 of us and our cases. There is view from the window is the street (to be expected from a city centre hotel). The mattress was firm (2 singles however this was not noticeable and did not separate during the night unlike other hotels we've visited!) Sheets and bedspread on the bed with a blanket and duvet in the wardrobe. Also a spare pillow in the wardrobe\nRoom safe at no extra charge which also made a change\nThe bathroom was a generous size. I do agree with others about the shower it is snug. But I'm only 5 foot and it was a jacuzzi shower so I was happy!\nBreakfast was a good selection from cereals and pastries to eggs and cheese. The staff bring your hot drinks and toast. So no fiddling with a communal toaster!\nTea and coffee available in a little seating area by the lobby was very welcome.\nI'm surprised at some of the comments. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Yes we had to leave the key, for which we were glad, one less thing to worry about especially as pickpockets are busy in Rome. It made me feel more secure knowing no one could pinch it and ransack our room!\nOur only slight problem was requesting a pillow from the menu. You are able to request from 9 - 9 however we arrived later than this. The pillow did not appear that night or the next day. When I asked about it the receptionist was convinced it had been done, we did have an extra blanket though. Lesson learnt - learn the Italian for pillow! I'm sure if we'd pursued it a pillow would've been provided but it didn't present a major problem for us.\nNicely located. Just a 10 minutes walk from termini station and metros nearby. Also walkable to the colleseum.\nSupermarket 2 doors down and a few restaurants nearby\nOverall a pleasant stay. We would return", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:23:16.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
