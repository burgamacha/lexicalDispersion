It is no more than 10 minutes' walk from the Place des Vosges and the heart of the Marais district, so its location is a major selling point.\nAnother major selling point are its staff who are extremely pleasant and helpful. I was due to stay in a double room for one night before moving to a junior suite for two nights, but on arrival I was upgraded to the suite for the first night as well. Comfortable bed. Decent buffet breakfast with hot and cold options.\nCriticisms or areas where there could be room for improvement:-\n1. There is no actual outside space as the original courtyard has been covered over and is used as a dining area\n2. The air conditioning needs overhauled - it isn't very efficient\n3. The wifi is slow and erratic.\nNone of the above would put me off staying here again. I definitely would stay again and would recommend it to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:35:43.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
