I had a fantastic experience. I called ahead and received instructions for taking the subway there, they were excellent I came out of the subway (34th St. Penn Station) and exited 35th & 8th Ave North Corner (there are several exits) and the hotel is literally steps away.. sooo convenient!!\nMy Platinum Elite IHG membership was acknowledged at check in and Luis at the front desk was awesome for our entire trip. Firstly to acknowledge my birthday he gave me a couple free breakfast and drinks vouchers which we redeemed at the Cork and Kale in house restaurant it was delicious and our waiter super friendly. Luis also helped throughout our short stay with directions and recommendations and being overall a friendly nice guy (Thanks Luis your an asset to the Even Hotel!!) The room was great! on the 10th floor which was not to high up (it goes up 25 floors) but it was quiet and so very clean and well appointed. There is an awesome Thai Noodle place around the corner on 9th, ZoobZib, EXCELLENT Food!! and the location of the hotel makes a convenient base to see all thinks NYC ....exellent stay and will most certainly be back as soon as the snow clears :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:10:50.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
