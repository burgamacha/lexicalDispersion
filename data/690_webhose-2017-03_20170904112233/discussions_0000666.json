The staff are amazing. they go the extra mile, with warm smiles leaving you feeling there is nothing they would rather be doing than making your stay fabulous. The lady in the gift boutique even stayed way after closing to assist in finding a shirt that I wanted, even driving down to the Pro Shop at the golf course with me to ensure that I found what I was looking for. Full marks to the lady at the pro-shop for also staying after hours to assist. It is things like this that makes one inclined to return time and time again. Of course the rooms are great, wonderful views and the elegance of the lobby and lounges spills over to the both dining areas, on the lake and in the main hotel. Food was pretty good but its the staff that really make this a gem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:21:36.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
