To cover the main points of our stay:\nCheck-in: Quick, friendly, informative.\nLocation: Handy to the metro, with Perache and St George's stations nearby. Near many restaurant options, theatres, and 15 minutes to Printemps and Galeries Lafayette.\nRooms: The room was a bit tight, but modern and renovated. We were facing the road, but it wasn't over noisy, given this is a city! The room had a fridge, air con, coffee/tea. Not a great deal of cupboard space or shelving. No drawers. Bathroom was modernized, no tub, but very large shower. Good pressure, plenty of hot water. Large flat screen TV with plenty of programming choice. There is the ability to switch to English on certain shows, but it is a bit cumbersome. Efficient housekeeping.\nWi-Fi: Free for as many devices as you like. Measured at up to 30 Mbs/sec. Fantastic.\nBreakfast: Is served in the cellar restaurant. It was priced at a special of 10 euros. Fair enough, with juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, potato, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, cheeses and cold meat options.\nOverall condition: Hotel is bright, well maintained and clean.\nOther: There is a computer and printer for guest use.\nRecommendation: Rooms are pretty small and basic, but great value for money. We'd definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:29:01.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
