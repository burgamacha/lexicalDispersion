This hotel is amazing! Warm friendly lifestyle team, amazing rooms thar cater for everything.\nWe got off the plane and they were kind enough to let us check in early.\nThe beds, kitchenette, sofas, everything is bright, warm, thoughtful and efficient.\nYou are truly made to feel like an honoured guest.\nCompared to the Armani in Milan where we subsequently checked in, the lifestyle team's warmness and genuine staff at the Portrait Roma beats them by a huge huge margin. (See my separate review of the armani milan).\nWe truly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a fantastic pampering stay.\nYou will not be disappointed.\nThis hotel is THE HOTEL to stay in Rome.\n5 stars do not do this hotel justice.\nIt deserves 10 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:10:07.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
