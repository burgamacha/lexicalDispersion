The hotel was amazing. Location couldn't be more ideal near Paddington with many busses passing all the time near Lancaster gate. Moreover, Hyde Park was around the corner 2 minutes walking. The room was clean and nice. You get served everyday a vase with chocolate cookies and two bottles of water at your room free of charge. The only drawback that I believe it could be improved is the breakfast served. Even though there was some selection of cereals, fruits and youghurt, the buffet lacked of variety of pastries. However, you can par near 10 pounds and get an English breakfast with eggs and bacon etc at the hotel. I would say you could get more by going out and have a breakfast at any restaurant. Nevertheless, this didn't change my mind about the hotel. The people at the reception will always be willing to help you in anything you need. In fact many of them, speak a variety of languages like Spanish, French and so on, thus making you feel like home far from home. At my arrival at the hotel which was approx 11:30 am , the room was already prepared. As a person working in the tourism industry in Greece, I always aim to read trip advisor reviews and make some research about the hotels that I'm about to stay. The Royal Park didn't dissapoint me at all. All above my expectations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:47:34.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
