They loved it so I thought that I would give it a try. The room was lovely. The food was excellent and the dining service team was beyond professional. My daughter lives in NYC and we had dinner in the restaurant. Everything was perfection. I also had lunch there the next day and my experience and service was perfection. What I truly want to share is that a few hours after I checked out I was on the train back to Philadelphia when I realized that I left a very expensive ring on the counter in the bathroom. I immediately called the hotel and was connected to Sal in Security. I explained what happened and he told me he would go to the room himself and check. Within 10 minutes he called me back and said that he had the ring in his possession and that housekeeping had retrieved and secured the ring. I was so grateful for the honesty of housekeeping and Sal's quick reaction and response. I posted this story on Facebook and Instagram. I appreciate, more than you know of my positive experience at The Archer. I will be back again. Thank you Best, BMS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:16:07.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
