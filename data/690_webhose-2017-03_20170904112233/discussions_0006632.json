It's in a great location, was well priced when booking early. We have 2 children and trying to find a hotel that doesn't put them on a sofa bed in our room or have to pay full price for 2 rooms and be worried about them opening the door to anyone. This was ideal. The suite consists of two rooms with one entrance, therefore safe for the kids, and more pleasant for the parents. It took just over an hour to get from Charles de Gaulle Airport. Rather than a taxi (circa 80 euros) we used the RER Train to a Metro station, two changes later a 3 minute walk from La Tour Maubourg Metro Station we were checked in and away to visit the city. The Eiffel tower was a good 30 min walk and Notre Dame we used the Metro. The hotel room light fittings are old and in need of replacement but the bed was super comfy, the towels smelt great and were very soft. The en-suite was nicely done with good quality materials. The breakfast was adequately priced and their was enough choice for a good continental breakfast. Wifi was good and the coffee machine made excellent coffee. (Bean to Cup) All in all I would recommend this hotel and the suites for families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:45.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
