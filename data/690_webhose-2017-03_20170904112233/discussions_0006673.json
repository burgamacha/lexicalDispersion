We liked the character of the interior. From the hotel you can easily walk to Southwark Cathedral, Borougmarket and the Shard. There are plenty of possibilities to dine out in the neighborhood of the hotel. Many monuments are on walking distance. WE also like the possibility to take the boat from Tate Modern into the city and especially to Tate Brittain.\nBreakfast was very also good.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with view on The Shard. It's wonderful at night. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:46:18.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
