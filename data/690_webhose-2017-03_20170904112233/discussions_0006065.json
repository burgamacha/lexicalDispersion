It's my go-to place in NYC when I need to stay in Midtown. I stay at this hotel around 2-3 times a year. I'm an Accor Platinum member and have always been received well at this hotel. This definitely is a step above any other Novotel I've stayed in and definitely is the flagship hotel of Novotel. I usually stay at the more upscale Accor properties such as Sofitel or Pullman but this hotel definitely impresses.\nThe beds are very very comfortable and fluffy and you honestly just want to lie in them all day. The rooms are spacious enough and the room is spotlessly clean. The breakfast at the hotel offers a big spread (which is kind of rare for NYC) which definitely will satisfy all palates.\nThe two things holding this hotel from a 5-star review is the nickel and diming practices they have: they charge you $2 for each package received at the hotel and $1 per bag to hold your bags. I've stayed in tons of hotels in NYC and never experienced this and dislike this kind of business practice. The second thing is the water pressure, it's honestly awful at times here.\nBut.. this place can be really well priced if you get in at the right time and it's great value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:57:12.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
