There is a reason that this hotel has been rated #1 in Rome. A very hospitable host, Maurizio is so proud of his city and he wants all his guests to love it as much as he does so his recommendations are very good. The accommodation is clean and comfortable with lots of amenities. Beautiful grounds and very quiet. We loved our stay in Rome and it was made even better because we stayed at Appia Antica. I recommend it to everyone when we talk about future travel to Italy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:42:08.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
