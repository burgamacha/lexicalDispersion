Our room on a river cruise was much larger. But it's an attractive room, with decor that neatly straddles the current age and the past, and it has everything we need. Some of the concessions to the lack of space are quite clever: tucked behind a door in the wood panelling is a mini-fridge, a room safe and several shelves. The clear glass in the double-hung window in the bathroom has been replaced with a mirror. Most important, we can perfectly adjust the heat and light level, and the room is high enough off the street that the noises of the city do not seriously intrude. There is a restaurant on site, but the atmosphere at night is rather disco-ish and probably won't appeal much to anyone over 45. The place is within walking distance of Lincoln Center and Times Square, so what's to complain?\nRoom Tip: Bring ear plugs.
