Room is spotlessly clean and had enough space. Mini bar was well supplied.\nWe did not experience any noise even though we were situated next to the courtyard. Weather was awful so maybe this helped with noise as no one would want to sit out in the rain.\nThe reception staff was very friendly and it was manned 24 hours a day.\nHotel was ideally located. We flew into CDG and got on the RER train into Chatellet des Halles. Only took 45 minutes. We then took metro to Charles de Gaile - Etoile. The view as we walked up the stairs and the Arc de Truimphe was right in front of us was perfect.\nOnly a 15 min walked down Ave Kleber and hotel was on a side street.\nWe will definitely return. We only paid Â£100 per night through Booking.com. Great value.\nTrocadero and Eiffel Tower only 15 min walk.\nPlenty of nice restaurants on Avenue Kleber.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:20:58.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
