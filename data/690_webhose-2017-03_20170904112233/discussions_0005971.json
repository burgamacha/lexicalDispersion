It is convenient to multiple metro stops and an easy connection to various train stations. We arrived late at night after the train ride from London and checked into our rooms without problem. We were told of the hotel services, honor bar in the lobby as well as the coffee / tea / snacks. The following morning - after a brief stop at the breakfast in the lobby complete with bread / cheese / juice / fruit etc and pastries - we were given perfect directions to the correct metro stop to connect to the train station for our day trip to Normandy. Finally on our last day, we were able to store our luggage, they called for a taxi and were very helpful on suggestions of places to go / visit. This may all sound routine for a top notch hotel, but it was a nice experience for my family after a long trip.\nIn terms of accommodations the hotel was perfect. The shower was the best shower i had during my 10 day trip to Europe and probably better than mine at home. There was plenty of L'Occitane shampoo / conditioner / body wash etc for our stay. The bed was very comfortable and in fact most of us wanted to stay asleep our last day instead of touring the city. A grocery store is right next door, a cheese shop a few stores down and several restaurant options right around the corner.\nWould highly recommend staying here if you get the chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:39:26.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
