Given that we have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, it is sometimes difficult to impress us, but we certainly were this time! The suite was absolutely stunning with 2 beautiful top floor balconies overlooking the best area in Mayfair. The vast sitting room with its double-height ceiling had a real WOW factor. The service and hospitality were world class. I would have to say I would rank this as the best hotel in London and that is no mean feat given the choice. Thanks for a wonderful stay and memories that will last a life time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:20:49.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
