I was completely impressed with the personal attention and friendliness of the hotel reception staff both for checkin and checkout. On checkin, the reception agent took the time to personally explain my Marriott rewards benefits, show me the restaurant/bar areas and elevators. On checkout, there was a mistake made with my form of payment (Marriott gift card). They promised everything would be corrected within the hour and sure enough, it was when I checked the card balance from the airport. Kudos to Emily and Bryan for their \"can do\" attitude and friendly smiles.\nI had stayed at another nearby hotel the previous night whose rooms did not feel comfortable. My stay at the Courtyard was completely relaxing. I got a good night sleep. And, I liked the roominess of the bathroom compared to my previous hotel. I would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Ice machines are on 3,5,7, and 9.
