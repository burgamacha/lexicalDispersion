The security at the gate is to make sure that the hotel is not a target like the one in Mumbai. I was impressed with the warm welcome I received, and found the same enthusiasm when I checked in at 3:00 AM on January 1, 2017. My hotel room was extremely clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Shuttle service is excellent, and very dependable, even at the wee hours. The food department does a good job with the food presentation. You can expect freshness, as well as a variety of what is offered on the menu. Great ice cream. The restaurant is large enough, and they have tables outside facing Lake Victoria. This hotel has a modern elevator, and the WiFi is free\nand moderately fast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:59:26.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
