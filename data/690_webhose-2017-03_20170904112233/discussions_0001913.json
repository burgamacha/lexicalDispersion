Right in the heart of Time Square/Theater District yet set back enough to provide quiet from the hustle and bustle. The room was clean had everything one would need & affordable. They even had a tasty continental breakfast. There was no view but then again the wall of the Bldg next door shielded the hotel from any possible time square noise. Highly recommended for a few night stay in the city!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:17:55.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
