The two ladies that checked us in were so personable and were more than helpful when we asked questions. We were talking and my mom had told them she had not been having a very good past couple weeks and really needed a vacation. When we got to our room, Britany Claribel sent up champagne with a very sweet card for my mom. It's the little things that make all the difference, and it made my mom feel so special. We stayed there for six days and had no complaints. If you needed something, they were so quick to bring it to you and make sure you were taken care of. The location is perfect because it is walking distance to so much, but is still on a quiet street. It felt peaceful and relaxing. Our room had beautiful views of the city and the room was very nice and clean. We loved this hotel and will be staying here on our next visit to New York City!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:25:34.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
