That's the only way to describe this hotel. I'd read mixed reviews so was interested to see for myself how good or bad it was. I booked because of the location, right by the London Eye and overlooking Westminster Bridge and Big Ben. In fact you'll see from the photos that if I stretched my arm out the window, I'd actually touch one of the Eye pods! Okay, slight exaggeration but that's how close we were.\nI am a regular to Marriott Hotels as a Gold Member but regardless of this, I always ask for a high room, this time also asking if we can face the river. I asked again on check-in and was pleased we got a room on the 4th floor with great views. Room was comfortable, super comfy bed, pleasantly decorated with all that one needs.(see photos) We had no problem connecting to wi-fi and this was the case throughout our stay. We had access to a private lounge area with free drinks, tea, coffee, beverages etc. The pool area and changing rooms were clean, lockers had keys and lounge chairs around the pool, which was slightly heated. Nice comfy area overall in which to relax and chill out.\nGillray's Steakhouse & Bar. We had a table booked for 8pm on a Saturday night and went for the 3 course and a cocktail option for Â£29 each.\nThe bar area was quite loud so we were grateful that we were seated way down near the end of the restaurant.\nAlthough it was busy, we were served drinks in no time at all. We then received a complimentary, 'yorkshire pudding with cheese' out of nowhere.\nStaff were attentive, helpful and polite all evening. Seats and restaurant area all comfortably furnished and the food, really tasty.\nWhat was nice is that we weren't rushed and there was a comfortable gap between servings. In all we spent two and a half hours and it was a thoroughly enjoying, relaxing evening.\nGot a good nights sleep as I found the bed really comfortable. Breakfast was in the private lounge area and it was a small choice for a full English or buffet, whichever you preferred. Small plates but you could go up as often as you want. Overall, great stay. Not cheap but we spent the Saturday night there and for me, it was perfect. Highly recommend.
