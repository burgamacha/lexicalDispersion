On arrival we were upgraded to a huge suite which was possibly the largest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The hotel is very well maintained and house keeping was excellent. The one observation I would make about the rooms is that the mattresses are very firm - this is my preference but if you like a bed you're going to sink into, you'll be disappointed. All the staff we interacted with spoke good English and the breakfast buffet offered a wide selection of international options- although the standard of breakfast food was only average.\nThe hotel is walking distance to Tiananmen Square, The forbidden palace and the Temple of Heavenly Peace, as well as a number of large shopping malls and restaurants. It's about 12 minutes walk to the nearest metro station (and the Beijing metro system is super cheap and very easy to navigate).\nThe hotel arranged an airport pick up for us which was helpful but extremely expensive- it cost RMB550 where as our taxi to the airport upon departure only cost RMB130- so I would recommend making alternative transport arrangements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:27:09.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
