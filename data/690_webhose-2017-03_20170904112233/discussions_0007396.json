The main lobby, bar and breakfast area is a really nice place to spend time. The staff are excellent! The rooms are typical Ibis, which is a bit of a shame but it was very quiet and comfortable. My only criticism is th 'new reception' idea - no desks just staff hovering with iPads, which is fine if there aren't many people by when there are, people get frustrated as i did as there is not 'order' of first come first served, what was wrong with a desk reception (with the nice projections behind) . I always try to stay at this hotel when I'm in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:31:46.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
