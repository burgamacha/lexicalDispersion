It is, hands down, perhaps the most welcoming, warm, delightful, and comfortable boutique hotels - or any hotel, come to think of it - I've experienced in the world. This may sound like an absurd statement, but as a long-time TripAdvisor contributor, I rarely make such claims. From the array of treats in the lobby at all times (including delicious strawberry shortcake at tea-time) to the extraordinary breakfasts, to the special fights at turn-down every night (and a little candle lit in the bathroom) I honestly can't imagine any way to augment a stay there. The rooms are incredibly well-appointed and comfortable - as well as quiet, which is of utmost importance to me. I spent a lot of time in my room during my recent 8-night stay, not only because I was working, but because I LOVED being in it. I don't think I've ever been so reluctant to leave my cocoon.\nIt's also incredibly convenient, located between two tube stops, with steps of the Victoria and Albert museum, Harrod's, an array of stylish restaurants, and a flower-stall. Ok I must stop - this is beginning to sound like an ad! But I promise you will not - can not - be disappointed. The staff is incomparable.\nRoom Tip: I've stayed in several rooms over the years - they are all wonderful!
