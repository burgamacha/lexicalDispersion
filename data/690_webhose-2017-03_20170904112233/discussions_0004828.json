The staff then couldn't do enough to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. The hotel is intimate and friendly with a perfect and quiet setting, just off the main road. It has a perfectly laid out dinning room/bar and lounge area and couldn't have been more appropriate. How delighted were we to come back this year, (2016) for my 57th birthday with two friends. We weren't disappointed, as it was exactly as we remembered with helpful, knowledgable and friendly staff. Excellent service and our friends agreed it was the perfect location for our weekend in Paris. Thank you Villa Beaumarchais. You are a great team. We will be back again! Room 408.
