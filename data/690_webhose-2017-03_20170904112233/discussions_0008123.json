I managed to find the official website from the TripAdvisor advert which takes you straight to their website. I also read the many reviews where people book basic rooms instead of standard rooms thinking that they all have private bathrooms. After reading and researching tons of websites its quite a common mistake. The other mistake people make is they miss the free English Breakfast when booking with them directly. The manager Darren at the reception who checked us in was extremely prompt and personal. He provided us with maps for the area and loads of useful information. We had to call from our room to the reception when we were ready for breakfast and they made me sure the table was prepared for us which was amazing. The girls that worked in the breakfast room where also very nice and the freshly cooked English Breakfast made to order was something you would get at a nice quality restaurant. None of this buffet eat as much as you want nonsense which I can't stand. I noticed the staff/customer ration was quite high which is quite unusual for a small outfit. Maybe that's why they do so well. The nice walk to Camden Town via Ganary Square was great on the amazing Sunny days we had while in London. Brilliant hotel and must say well done to all.\nRoom Tip: rooms are spacious and clean See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:36:01.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
