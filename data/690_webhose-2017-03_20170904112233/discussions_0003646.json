The hotel is on an almost private street with other hotels that you dont hear the noise of busy streets, but just 100 yards from the main street which was very convenient. The location of the hotel is also quite close to all the places youll want to see, especially by Metro, which is just around the corner. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the staff at the Corona Opera Hotel was very courteous and accommodating. Our thanks to Jerome, Horacio and the staff for making our experience so comfortable! I highly recommend a stay here and well be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:35:56.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
