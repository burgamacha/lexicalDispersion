The staff are very helpful and the breakfast is good too. The only thing I would say is the location is central in terms of getting to places but is located in a narrow and strange alleyway. It's not a touristic area which I guess can be a good thing. The Subway is a ten minute walk away. They also have shadow art performances free for guests three nights a week. Good value for money I would say.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:00:20.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
