Although the room I stayed in was on the small side it was very clean and comfortable with all the amenities one could require. I had breakfast in the restaurant and it was excellent with fresh croissant, and pastries plus bacon eggs cheese and everything that you would expect. The staff were courteous and helpful with the bartender up for special mention for his personality and good service. The main plus is the location , my colleague (who has previously lived in Paris) took me on a walk from the hotel that took in many sights all within easy distance from the hotel. My final note is the nice touch of the manager putting a hand written note under the door thanking me for staying. I will return with my wife for a vacation trip at some point soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:52:05.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
