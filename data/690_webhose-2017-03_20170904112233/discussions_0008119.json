The hotel is in a good, albeit rather soulless location (near the Wellington Barracks and the Ministry of Justice), however there are a number of redeeming features. The Edwardian architecture of the building is lovely, the interior is well-appointed, the room was quiet on the weekend - thankfully (a building is being erected behind the hotel, so there was a lot of noise on Friday afternoon). The furniture in the room is a little tired (faux-classic and rather damaged), and the bed far too soft for my liking. The bedlinen however, is lovely, and attention to detail very good. I didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel this time, but will do in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:30:45.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
