As we were staying in the city for quite a while, we wanted to stay at a reputable hotel with good facilities and one that was close to the metro/RER trains (Raspail/Port Royal) for easy transport and also in a good location for restaurants. If this is also what you require, this hotel is for you!\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We stayed in the cosy double room and although it was small in comparison with other rooms, it was more than enough and really felt homely. Our bed was comfortable, the windows soundproofed with blackout curtains (I'm a very light sleeper so this really helped) and the air conditioning was a good bonus. Another good point of the room is the safety deposit box, kettle and tea and mini fridge. The room service and cleanliness was at a top standard and the free wifi throughout the hotel was very strong.\nThere is also breakfast served here and we really enjoyed the buffet. Food was delicious and the gentleman who served us was very smiley and friendly. The staff in the hotel in general are really lovely and helpful... We can't fault the service at all.\nOverall we had a lovely stay at the hotel and very happy with the service we received. Merci beaucoup Hotel Aiglon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:31:43.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
