The staff was very friendly. The room was very small, but we were in Europe after all and sizes are a bit different than in the US. The room was at a very reasonable price, given the excellent location and the cleanness (I looked even behind the toilet- not a spec of dust anywhere). We had a view of the Tower, we would keep the window open for a while and it was pretty quiet, the room was overlooking the court. We loved the neighborhood- young crowd, trendy restaurants near by (Les Cocottes- a must), walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, metro station. We loved our stay!\nRoom Tip: rooms overlooking the court yard are quiet, view of Eiffel Tower is Great See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:17:42.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
