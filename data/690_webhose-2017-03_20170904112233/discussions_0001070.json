Hotel lobby is good and can accommodate quite a lot people. Room rent is bit higher compare to other properties. Parking cost you a heavy toll to your pocket as it is paid one but which is applicable to most of the SFO hotels. breakfast is good and healthy but less variety if you have a plan for more than 1 week. Evening social is good and enjoyable. Rooms are bit cozy especially Queen bed room where I used to stay. Room service is not so good. Need to poke you at front desk then only they do. Kitchen has a kind of stuffs starting from hover, fridge, micro oven, dish washer, pots, pans, plates, coffee maker, toaster, etc. View is nice and added advantage. They only have airport shuttle which is actually problematic if you don't have a car as there is not a single restaurant are grocery nearby at walking distance.\nRoom Tip: Don't go for Bay view rooms. As this will cost you an extra bucks but not so fruitful.
