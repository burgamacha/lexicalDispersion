My requests are always honored and whenever possible they automatically upgrade me. Some of the rooms can be spacious, but all are very clean and comfortable. Keep in mind this IS New York City, so don't go to any hotel expecting lots of room unless you reserve a suite. The staff is always efficient and courteous (especially when I speak directly with reservations). The guests who stay here tend to be more respectful and mature. I have never experienced loud (drunken) talking or behavior in the hallways. It is very quiet. This is a boutique hotel located in an excellent UWS neighborhood. You are only 2 blocks from the 1 train and there are tons of restaurants and cafes and shops all within minutes. Central Park West is only three blocks away. There are several boutique hotels in the area, but I greatly favor Hotel Belleclaire for both price and quality. I cannot say the same for NYLO located across Broadway. After 11 years there as a VIP I received horrific service (multiple ways) on one visit and received nothing more than a token, oh, we're so sorry. Check out Hotel Belleclaire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:16:02.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
