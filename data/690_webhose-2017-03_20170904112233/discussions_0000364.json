Our room was small but very cosy and clean and it was cleaned daily. Beds were so comfy! Reception staff were helpful and helped instruct us how to get to Disney Land by giving us a map. Amazing location, metro around the corner, bars and restaurants everywhere, Eiffel Tower is a 10 minute walk away (we walked there on our first night when we arrived at about 11pm, it's easy to find if you follow the light!)\nOverall a great hotel and I would definitely recommend and will be coming back to stay in the future! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:57:56.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
