The location is perfect, and the hotel is within a stones throw of some great restaurants, patisseries, and local shops. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and very kind to put up with my poor attempts to speak French (I've only recently started learning!).\nThe rooms are quite small but this is standard in big cities where space comes at a premium. Our room was clean and well-presented, if a little tired (reason for 4 circles instead of 5). A fresh coat of paint would easily fix that though. We couldn't get the air-con to work but not sure if that was a user error or a genuine problem. We were so busy out and about in the wonderful city that we forgot to mention it to staff and it certainly didn't impact on our enjoyment of the hotel.\nWe would definitely stay here if visiting Paris again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:45:54.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
