Please consider this is an older hotel. If you look closer there are items that need attention, such as, some of the carpet should be cleaned, the pool had Alge growing on the walls, some of ceilings needed a little touch up paint, picture had loose fabric (which could easily be glued on). These are just a few things, which did not bother me, but might not sweeten your day.\nThe breakfast buffet was super - fantastic selection for every taste. I did not have breakfast included, but did not mind paying 200 (including tip)...as I said super delicious.\nThis hotel has the most wonderful location - you are walking distance from shopping and the palace and forbidden city.\nI had a massage - bring cash if you want to get one - the spa is a little bit more difficult to find - it's in the basement of the adjacent building. The spa itself was super nice - massage was great.\nOverall loved the hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:20:27.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
