I travel to NYC frequently, and need to be in the Times Square area, and for the price you will not find many comparable hotels. Yes, the hotel is dated - no shiny new kitchenette or bathroom fixtures - but it is convenient, clean, very roomy for NYC, and the staff is helpful and responsive. I had a deluxe king at the end of one of the corridors, and found the hotel to be quiet, without much noise from the hallway traffic or neighboring rooms. The elevator does take its time, depending on when you are coming/going, but overall was a very nice stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:58:45.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
