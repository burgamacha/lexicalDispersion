This is becoming my favorite place to stay when I come into the city for business thanks to the amazing service of the staff. Especially Renata Zablocka who works at the front desk and goes out of her way to make sure my stay is above and beyond exceptional. It's customer service like this that brings me back and makes me a loyal customer. As someone who has built a career and brand on travel, these special stays are always remembered and very much appreciated.
