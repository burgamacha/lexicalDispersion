The entrance is small and can be busy with people checking in and out at busy times. We were early and our room was not ready but we were able to leave our bags and get out on the town. We returned and checked in flawlessly and our bags were delivered to our room within 5 minutes of getting into the room.\nThe room was great and suited our needs perfectly. Breakfast on the 7th floor terrace is very good for a charge and we only used it one morning preferring to take our chances outside in local deli etc.\nStorm Stella hit on the Tue which curtailed our activities that day and all flights on the Tue were cancelled so we were worried about getting back to the UK on the Wed 15 Mar. But all worked well.\nI would definitely stay here again for its location on West 51 between 5th and 6th Avenues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:35:20.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
