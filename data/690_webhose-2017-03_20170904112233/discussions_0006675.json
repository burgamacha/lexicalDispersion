Small and modern and really trendy only minutes from Leicester Square. Friendly check in and I was super impressed with the plentiful cheese and wine that is FREE between 6 and 8pm if I remember correctly! Superb breakfast too that you had to pay for but again it was good value with lots of fresh produce on offer including cute mini bacon butties! The bathrooms have glass walls in the rooms so perhaps not the best bet if you are not very intimate with someone! Quiet though considering it is in the centre of London and while not cheap it is very good value in comparison with other London hotels I have stayed it. I would definitely recommend it for couples exploring London or enjoying a theatre break - as I was at the time. Just don't bring a big suitcase!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:15:41.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
