It's very hectic the minute you step out the front door, but is a great location to explore the city. There's lots of great street food around, as well as many sights, the subway and a nice park (can't recall the name... just about 10 minutes away) Beijing was not my favorite city, but BDBH was a nice place to come back to after exploring the city in the Beijing heat. There are many bars on the main street and a nice common area to relax on the first floor/basement of the hostel. Some rooms didn't have windows, but the AC is nice. Also, the comp breakfast next door is a nice touch. Enjoy! Get centralized in Beijing! Make sure to right your name on the wall!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:19:53.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
