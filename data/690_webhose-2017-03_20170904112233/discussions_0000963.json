The rooms are fantastic, the staff are so helpful and friendly and it is great value considering the location. And the all inclusive continental breakfast and wine / cheese tastings are an added bonus. A special mention for Gene, one of the doormen. Very helpful and a very nice guy. My daughter and I enjoyed our 9 night stay at Casablanca and look forward to returning in the not too distant future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:04:56.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
