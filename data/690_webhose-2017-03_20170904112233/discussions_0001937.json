It is a lovely little hotel on the first floor of an old building in via Margutta. The rooms were compact and so were the showers, but comfortable, and well decorated. Very convenient for central Rome. Plenty of shops and only 2 minutes from the Spanish Steps. Ideal if you want to spend time out, and sightseeing, but comfortable when you get back. Very clean and the staff extremely kind and ready to help. Nice continental breakfast, and they are happy to make you a cup of tea or coffee if you are there during the day. No lounge as such, as the hotel is very small, with only 18 rooms, but you can sit in the breakfast room. Claudio, the concierge and not sure if also manager, was delightful and could not have been nicer and more helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:19:50.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
