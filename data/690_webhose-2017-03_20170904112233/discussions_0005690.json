First, the location is so convenient to most everything one would want to do in NY especially going to the theater and eating in great restauants. Secondly, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful doormen, desk staff, bar staff and maids. The only drawback my friend and I encountered was the elevator....only one and very slow! We were told a second elevator would be installed soon and hopefully that is true. We were on 4th floor, so most times I walked the stairs and not a problem for me. My friend on the other hand, had a bad knee and could not do stairs. I suggest that if you are able to do stairs, don't get a room above the fifth floor. I am not a young person, but I love a challenge and recorded lots of steps while in New York. Also, rooms are beautifully decorated and the pillows are the best I have ever had in a hotel. I will return and stay here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:11:43.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
