But the quality of service, the homey ambiance and the perfect location of the St. Jacques Hotel has shown me that not all Paris hotels are the same.\nI travel alone, and I felt safe in this neighborhood at night. There are terrific restaurants within minutes (I'm a chef) of the hotel. And the professional and extremely helpful staff are the best I have encountered during my many years of travel. And it is central to most of the sights of Paris.\nI highly recommend staying at this lovely hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:28:32.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
