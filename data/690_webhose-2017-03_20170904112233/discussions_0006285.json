However the food was very good and we ate there on a number of occasions. Having said that we did miss the option of a fine dining restaurant and so ate out more frequently than in earlier years simply in the interests of variety.\nThe staff have always been exceptional at the Marine and 2017 was no exception with Letitia and Regina standing out. Thanks too to Claudia and her colleagues on the Travel Desk for making all those restaurant bookings for us. Annemie, the General Manager, was very professional with an eye for detail and could not have done more to make our stay any more sublime.\nWe will be back !\nRoom Tip: Always try for a sea view room on the 1st floor.
