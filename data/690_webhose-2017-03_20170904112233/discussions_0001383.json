Before we arrived I arranged a surprise for my wife to be in our room as it was her birthday and the hotel were very accommodating and helpful. Location wise it is great just off one of the major roads in Via Nationale and no more than 10 minutes walk from the start of the tourist sites.\nThe room was very clean and well maintained and the hotel overall had a nice ambiance- we intended to use it merely as a base for exploring the city and as such didn't need the extra amenities you might expect in a higher starred hotel- it was the perfect hotel for our trip.\nThe breakfast was simple but we loved it- fully fuelled us up for the day ahead and all the staff were friendly and welcoming (particularly Anna).\nWe will stay here next time we visit Rome (if available) as having found what we wanted we don't need to look anywhere else and value for money for a hotel in a major city we found it great value", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:31:57.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
