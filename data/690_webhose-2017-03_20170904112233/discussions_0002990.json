The hotel is amazing! Friendly and courteous staff, clean and spacious rooms and the breakfast on the terrace is a great way to start the day exploring. Would highly recommend eating in a local trattoria near to the hotel for authentic Italian food. The location is perfect for exploring Rome, 5 minutes walk to the colosseum. Would definitely stay here again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:52:31.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
