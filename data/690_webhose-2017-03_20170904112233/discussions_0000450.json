The wood panelled dining area and the charming courtyard gives this 19th century's building its elegance and charm. It is perfectly situated to explore some landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Rodin museum is just round the corner. All the staff is friendly and it is worth asking them for recommendations in terms of restaurants. We discovered a little gem 5 minutes walking away. Breakfast is served at your table and for 15 euros includes a fresh juice, yogurt and a full basket of fresh bread and pastries. Warmly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:42:20.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
