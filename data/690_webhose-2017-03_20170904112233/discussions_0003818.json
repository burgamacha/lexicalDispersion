Just a reception with really pleasant staff. Who always said morning, welcome back. Even asked if we wanted a map. We were shown to our room. Standard double and it had a card, chocolate and wine courtesy of the hotel. This was a lovely surprise.\nThe rooms have a little kitchen in them which includes a coffee machine, microwave and cutlery. Although we didn't use the microwave the coffee machine was a great touch. The shower/bathroom was a really good size and modern.\nThe bed was comfortable although due to the layout is very little room on one side. But I knew this looking at other reviews.\nThe hotel is close to Victoria station and we walked to Covent Garden area in about 35-45mins and that was strolling.\nOverall clean, modern hotel quiet hotel with friendly staff. That served our stay well.\nWe will be coming back and also check out other hotels. Especially on the deals we got.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:59:57.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
