It has been our go-to spot in Paris for years and the remodel did not disappoint. While the rooms are on the small side by US standards - they in no way feel cramped. The modern furnishings are beautiful and integrate stylishly with the historic features of the property. The new bathrooms are luxe and I love that they now have hardwood floors in the rooms. But the real star at The Montalembert is the service. Everyone who works there - from the doormen to the people in the restaurant - are friendly and so on top of their game. We stay there a few times a year and I am always pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name by almost every employee. As an indication of their commitment to excellent service - when we were checking out at 5:00 am I told the man at the front desk that I thought the elevator was stuck on the third floor where my colleague was trying to load her things. He literally sprinted up the 3 flights, fixed the issue, loaded her and her things, raced back down the stairs to me and loaded all of our things in a taxi - all of this with a smile on his face. Wow! The location is superb with all the Left Bank offers and the Louvre just ten minutes away by foot as well. I highly recommend the Montalembert. We travel frequently all over the world and this hotel is a standout. I can not wait to go back for our next trip in the fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:54:11.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
