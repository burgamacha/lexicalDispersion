To open the entrance door is a trick! The signs say to push and pull? And you do just that. The receptionist was friendly and helpful. Our apartment was large, light and clean, although the walls could do with a fresh lick of paint. Air conditioning was very efficient (no doubt essential in the spring /summer) good sized bathroom (for a city hotel) but the shower-head points straight at the cubicle door (water on the floor as you get in) The bed and sofa-bed are at oposite ends of the apartment affording some privacy. The hotel location is really good, most of the main attractions (and the metro) within walking distance (especially good if you want to make an early start before the crowds) All in all this is a lovely, clean, friendly place to stay", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:01:17.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
