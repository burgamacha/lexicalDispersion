It is beautifully decorated and maintained, the attention to detail with the interior design and decor creates a warm and homely atmosphere in a uniquely Parisian way.\nThe rooms aren't huge but they are very nice and feature a comfortable bed and every mod con you could need is included. Not to mention a mini bar crammed with premium French wines and champagne.\nIn the salon they serve a free afternoon tea daily which is a nice touch and mirrors the friendly atmosphere of the staff who are available 24/7 and very welcoming and friendly.\nI booked through Egencia which included an express breakfast, which is delightful and includes 2 freshly baked croissants and a hot drink of your choice. You can take this in the salon or even indulge in breakfast in bed at no extra cost.\nOverall a great stay, you are a short walk from the Louvre, galleries La Fayette and the Champs Elysees and a taxi or metro ride away from many other sites.\nI plan to book direct next time as I think it will be cheaper but this would now be my go to hotel in Paris and I'll definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:26:04.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
