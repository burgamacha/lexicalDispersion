You're in SF for business. Need a car for meetings on the peninsula, east bay, wherever. Can't stay downtown (traffic, parking). Airport hotels are where it's at. The Marriott is the best I've had. (Hyatt is also good). Very professional staff, awesome M Club (pay for it if you don't have the status). Great shoe shine. Good bar, very good (but overpriced) restaurant. Rooms are basic Marriott...clean, functional, not awe inspiring. Walk across the street to the New England Lobster Company. Sit on a picnic table and have awesome lobster and dungeness crab.\nRoom Tip: Face north for closest to elevator. Most bay facing rooms require a hike...not worth it to me. See more room tips Green Features: Reusable glass water bottles in the club. Not ideal for travel but a nice touch for hotel use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:25:38.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
