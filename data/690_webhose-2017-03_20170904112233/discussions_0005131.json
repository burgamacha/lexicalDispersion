The room is not big but the high ceiling makes it more spacious than it actually is. The breakfast was really good and had everything you could wish for, the decor is nice but the best thing is the location!! It's in the middle of the trendiest area in Paris with a lot of nice restaurants and cool boutiques. I would definitely stay there the next time I come to Paris!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:39:04.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
