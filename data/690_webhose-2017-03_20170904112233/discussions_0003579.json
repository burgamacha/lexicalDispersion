Overall it was pretty good. The room was clean and comfortable for the most part though both my husband and I found it a little too warm to sleep despite turning off the heat and opening the balcony door for a little while before bed. We mostly solved this by asking for a single flat sheet which we used North American style instead of sleeping under the duvet. The room overlooked a busy street where cars are honking and there is fairly constant traffic noise (we were on an upper floor in a privilege room) that was heard even when the door was closed. If you are not used to downtown city noise this may be an issue for sleep (it bothered my husband much more than I). The front desk staff were very helpful and printed out our tickets for the Louvre/Versailles etc when the self service printer was out of service. A few small drawbacks to the hotel though that may or may not be a problem for others. I'm 5'9\" tall and had to bend my knees to fit under the rain head shower. Yes, there was a hand held that I could have used but I'm not sure the ceiling was more than 6' over the bath tub (which was quite large) so I'm not sure it would have been much easier. We opted to have breakfast included as I have nut and selfish allergies and know from previously being in Paris that that combination can be difficult for finding food at breakfast. We sent an email with our reservation to alert them to the allergy and they were able to show me a spread sheet with each breakfast item along with the allergens that they contained. This was excellent and very much appreciated. Sadly, when we looked at the tree nut line the only thing left from the breads/pastries was the plain white toast. There was a variety of meats/cheeses/yogurts to choose from though so that was ok. The location was only a few minutes walk from the metro and RER B and C lines and there were plenty of places to eat near by.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:35:16.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
