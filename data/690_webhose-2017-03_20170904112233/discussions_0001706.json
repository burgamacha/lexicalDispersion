Breakfast is a variety of everything you need and there are little treats and coffee that is complimentary throughout the day!\nThis was by far the best service we have received from any hotel that we've stayed at. Hedi and his team made our weekend away in Paris a truly special and memorable one.\nMostafa was especially helpful and welcoming during our stay - please extend our thanks to him and the rest of the team!\nFrom a very happy and grateful trio from London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:41:12.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
