We were greeted each time we arrived and left the hotel. We were acknowledged as Hilton Honors members at check-in.\nThe rooms are a decent size, with a good size bathroom, refrigerators, microwaves and coffee makers.\nThe front desk staff is very polite.\nOverall a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:30:02.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
