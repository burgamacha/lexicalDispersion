When looking for accommodation I was seeking a good location and a high quality Hotel. When researching this I constantly returned to reviews about the Artemide which seemed to stand out from the rest. I booked the reservation based on Trip Advisor recommendations and was not disappointed. The Hotel itself is lovely. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room overlooking the busy Via Nazionale and my Wife was presented with special Gifts to recognise the occasion. We soon found out that the Hotel was perfectly situated within walking distance of all major Attractions although we used a 'Hop On Hop Off ' Bus Trip to visit the Vatican which is an approximate 45 minute walk away. However, what stood out above everything was the friendly and professional attitude of the Team in all areas of the Hotel. The Breakfast is amazing and we were constantly offered different choices away from the beautifully presented and perfectly prepared Buffet. We enjoyed a relaxing meal in the Restaurant after a drink on the Roof Top Terrace and were offered a complimentary visit to the relaxing Spa after a busy day touring the City. Without being repetitive, this review of mine and reviews which persuaded me to book this Hotel initially are totally true and I would recommend the Hotel Artemide to anyone. Thank you.\nRoom Tip: Sirens and impatient local drivers make the ambience at the front of the Hotel lively See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:28:31.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
