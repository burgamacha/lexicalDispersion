Two people might feel a bit cramped but it's definitely enough room for a single person. The front desk staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great - it's a very short walk to Central Park, Lincoln Centre etc.\nI was a little disappointed by the breakfast - it was overpriced and mediocre. We also visited the Library Bar which was beautifully decorated but has very limited seating. With so many other options nearby it doesn't make sense to eat/drink at the hotel itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:52:13.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
