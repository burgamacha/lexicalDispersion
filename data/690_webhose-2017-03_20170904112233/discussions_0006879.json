Rooms are a little smaller than normal, but that is true anywhere in NYC. Room was modern, clean and well decorated. The fitness center was very good for a hotel with resistance equipment in addition to cardio. Great location, only a five minute walk to the subway (Q line) that takes you right to Times Square and from there you can find any subway line you need. It's relatively close to LaGuardia so cab ride runs $30-40 with tip. I priced other options and this hotel was a good value. My only recommendation for management is to secure the in-room safe. Ours was in the armoire and it wasn't attached to anything, so you could walk out with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:48:03.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
