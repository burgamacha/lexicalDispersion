I spent 5 days and 4 nights at The Kensington. Let me first say that you won't find a better neighborhood. The tube station is a short, five minute walk from the hotel. Several museums and restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel. I had breakfast at Town House, the hotel's restaurant, on three occasions and found it delicious. The hotel's common areas are wonderfully posh.\nMy deluxe room (209) was spacious with lots of storage. The room had outlets from all continents. If you didn't have an adaptor, it was no problem. It was awesome to relax under the rainfall shower head after a long day of sightseeing. The staff is what makes The Kensington extremely special. From the front desk associates, bellman, valet, concierge and wait staff, they went above and beyond during my entire stay. On the day that I checked out, I accidentally left behind one of my bags without realizing it. While in route to the airport, the concierge phoned me. Luckily, we were only a few minutes away and my driver was able to quickly return to the hotel. I am so grateful to the concierge for his quick thinking. I will most certainly return to The Kensington!\nRoom Tip: Room with king beds tend to be larger.
