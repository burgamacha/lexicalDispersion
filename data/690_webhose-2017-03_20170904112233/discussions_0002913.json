Spotlessly clean with comfy beds. The staff are just so lovely, multi lingual and cant help you enough. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice. Yes, the area is not the best but the hotel and staff certainly make up for that. They really look after your every need. Literally a 3 min walk to the nearest Metro at La Chapelle, ideal for sightseeing.\nWe had the best time and would not hesitate in returning to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:52:09.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
