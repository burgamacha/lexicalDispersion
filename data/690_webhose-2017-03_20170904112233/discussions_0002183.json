The staff at the reception was very friendly and welcoming. The room was quite small and without daylight, but the open bathroom had enough daylight. More important to me was that the room was very clean, with modern furniture, and the beds were very comfortable. It was quiet, although you are in the midst of Paris very close to the Arc de Triomphe. The location is great and the metro station, tourist attractions and many restaurants are within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again on a next trip to this great city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:53:38.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
