Hotel Basss was my first choice of hotels in this area. We received a very friendly welcome at check-in and they let us in our room early. The location is amazing, perfectly positioned in Montemarte. You can walk out the front door and have a range of delicious and fresh food, restaurants and bars. We didn't even have a chance to try it all. I also did all my souvenir shopping a few blocks away from the hotel, there were tons of great shops.\nI would definitely come back here again! Thanks so much for having us.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:40:17.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
