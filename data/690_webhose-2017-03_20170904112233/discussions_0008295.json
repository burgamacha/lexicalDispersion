I generally stay at the Holiday Inn within the Westfield. However this was full so I was booked into the Travel Lodge. Not heard good things about the place so was dreading it. Ok check in, all ok, quick and efficient. The room was clean and basic, the bed was comfortable. We were late checking in and decided we couldn't doing with the walk to the central Stratford area and would see what the cafe bar had to offer. My experience of Travel Lodge's food offers hasn't been good. Terrible in fact so wasn't looking forward to it. But how wrong I was, the food was spot on, good value for money and well presented. The manager was on duty (Blonde Lady) and she was the heart of the place. Service was quick and efficient and the bar prices were fair too. Breakfast included and again good. I have had worse in some high end hotels so would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:25:17.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
