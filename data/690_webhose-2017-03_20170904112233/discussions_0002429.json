What a kind, gentle, amazing individual he is!\nHe checked us in around 1:30 PM or so and provided an excellent customer service. Unfortunately, our room was not ready, so we went for a walk around the area. When we came back, we were told that our room was still not ready. We were in a pickle as we needed to have access to our room to change our clothes. We were attending a show which started at 5 PM.\nAfter few calls between him and housekeeping, Justin told us that our room on the 33rd floor was not going to be ready for another 15mn at least. By this time, it was almost 4:20 and we were late for the show. He offered us a similar room on the 29th floor and also credited our account for $75.00 for the inconvenience. He handle the entire situation with kindness and grace and I was really impressed with his personality and his outstanding customer service skills.\nAnyway, kudos for management for hiring such a kind individual! we understand how important it is to have outstanding employees. They are the face of any business and they can destroy your reputation or make it. Justin is certainly a great asset to your property.\nThe entire staff had a wonderful, joyful attitude and the bell men, door men, concierge were all very helpful.\nThere are no shortage of restaurants in Time Square yet we eat 3 times at your Dos Caminos restaurant...yes, this is how much we loved the food there and the staff were also phenomenal.\nWe certainly enjoyed our stay! Thank you.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors to avoid street noise, which is no fault of the hotel. Time Square is loud.
