Staff were wonderful and made us feel welcome. Rooms I agree are very small! but it was not a problem for us as we were hardly in the room and out exploring all the time. Good location for Rome as you can walk almost everywhere and we found it was the best way to get to see the real Rome. Breakfast was fantastic and we looked forward to it every morning.
