Each time I arrive, I am welcomed by by name by the doorman, usually Carl who is great. The reception staff is equally welcoming, normally also remembering my name. I prefer the new section and regularly get the same room on the first floor. Everything is first rate save for the bar in the back of the hotel. It is a stark contrast to the English refinement of the rest of the facility. Thankfully, the bar in the front is more traditional. While the Mayfair location may not be convenient to the City, the Connaught will always be my home in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:41:25.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
