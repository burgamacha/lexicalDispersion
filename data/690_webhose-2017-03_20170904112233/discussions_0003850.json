This time our stay was on the 43rd floor which looked over New York city. The room was big and comfy rather disappointed we had no coffee maker in the room or bottled water. I did pay extra for the executive lounge access which did provide bottled water, soda, juice and coffee all day also a breakfast and hors d'oeuvre in the afternoon but that was on the main level and we were on the 43rd. floor which was rather a long walk. We were given plenty of towels for our daily routine and we had an overall great stay, both front desk and housekeeping were very friendly to. This hotel is so close to so many things from Times Square to Central Park. Would I stay here again absolutely!\nRoom Tip: The top floors have the best views.
