After a short walk from Paddington Station we entered the hotel, to be greeted by a very pleasant receptionist. As we had arrived from Sydney on an early flight, the room was unavailable, so we left the luggage, and went out exploring the city. Upon returning, we went to our room (which was spacious and very nice) The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the shower great. Breakfast was included, and served in the basement. This included a great range of cereal, breads, fruit, and all followed by a Full English Breakfast.\nIts a great hotel, and will definately stay there when next in London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:50:42.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
