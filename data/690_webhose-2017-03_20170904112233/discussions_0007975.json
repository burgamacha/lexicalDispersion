Great if you are a foreign visitor as it will save you on roaming charges for data on your mobile/cell phone. It lets you browse and make calls for free and on the move. GREAT IDEA FOR TOURISTS.\nDownsides are that rooms are small, only have a shower and you can hear the noise from the trucks, police and buses on the main road if your room is facing it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:49:23.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
