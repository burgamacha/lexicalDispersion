It was beautiful, comfortable and spacious. The location was great, we had the train station a minute away and The Louvre museum 10 minutes away. Breakfast was great. The overall decoration was beautiful. We really felt we where in Paris. The staff were very cordial and kind always willing to help. The only thing I did not like was the restaurant recommendation from the front desk. DO NOT go to L\"Ardoise restaurant if you have kids. You will regret it!!\nRoom Tip: If you have kids, choose the junior suite See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:38:26.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
