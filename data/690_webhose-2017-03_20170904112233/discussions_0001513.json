From the minute we arrived to valet our car we were greeted very warmly by the doormen! We proceeded into the lobby of the most beautiful architecture that I have ever seen. My husband and I travel a lot and have stayed in some fine hotels but nothing like this. The front desk covered in tapestry was simply beautiful as we were warmly welcomed by Scott! As we entered the elevator area we saw the lounge with the incredible atrium as we looked up!! Wow just incredible!!! Our room was on the 6th floor. As we stepped off the elevator we looked down to the lounge where we had just been and it was breathtaking. I didn't know where to look first. We walked into our room followed by Joseph who brought our bags and saw a welcome with our name on the TV!! We felt like royalty. The room was gorgeous with a beautiful lamp with fringe and the bathroom was amazing!! My husband was intrigued by the sliding door to the bathroom! The bed was super comfy and that is something we are very picky about!!! We had drinks in the bar and then our girls went off to explore the city while my husband and I had the most spectacular meal at the hotel! The service was impeccable and we were catered to like royalty!! The food was out of this world with every mouth watering bite we devoured! This hotel located in Manhatten is an absolute must see and experience that should be on everyone's list! We can't wait to visit it again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:39:47.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
