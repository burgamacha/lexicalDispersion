Booked an access room which was all that was left to be honest but had plenty of space. Great nights sleeps in the bed! Coffee & tea making facility but if you are fussy, bring your own. Combined shower gel / hair wash supplied but the same rule applies. Hairdryer in room, which really has such a weak blow, it could take you a while to have fancy London hair!\nLocated less than 5 minuets walk from Monument station, right past a couple of pubs - see my other reviews - which was handy. Easy walk to Tower & London Bridge.\nAll staff we dealt with were great, really friendly and helpful - allowed us to leave our cases at the hotel until later in the day.\nWe had breakfast & dinner both were good for us. Bar service was fine.\nWe asked to use an iron and board when required, all good.\nAll in all a great stay and would use again.\nIf you want room with a view don't stay here - we were about 20ft away from people working in offices but this didn't bother us.... we were on holiday!\nWell recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:42:08.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
