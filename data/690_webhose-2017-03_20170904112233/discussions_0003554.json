The location is great and is a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Being located adjacent to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History you really couldn't ask for a better location. Our room, although a little on the small side, was very comfortable. Front desk staff were very polite and accommodating and were always happy to offer assistance. We did find the buffet breakfast a bit underwhelming with the hot food being lukewarm at best. Plenty of extremely satisfying dining options available around the Hotel. All in all a good stay for a couple of nights but probably wouldn't want to stay any longer than that.\nRoom Tip: Higher floor would be best option See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:47:56.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
