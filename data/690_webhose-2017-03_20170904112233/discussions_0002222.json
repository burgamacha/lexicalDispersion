Rooms are small, as all are in NYC but so well designed and organised i never felt claustrophobic as i have in other places. Windows to see NYC are great and iPad to control the room and tv is a great touch.\nThe beds were so comfortable - i think i had the best sleep in any hotel\nCan't wait to go back again.\nRoom Tip: South side have great views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:17:24.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
