Clean, Friendly, Warm, Spacious, Welcoming! Stayed 2 night in February on a girls weekend in the city and absolutely loved it. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were nice and spacious (especially in comparison to other hotels in NY where the rooms are tiny, like The Hudson for example....). Amazing location across the street from some fabulous restaurants and a walking distance to Columbus Circle. Would definitely come back next time.\nRoom Tip: Go have a fabulous brunch with a view at Landmarc at Columbus Circle.
