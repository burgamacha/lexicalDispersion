I have travelled extensively and have to say that this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. We booked through the hotel's own website and received an upgrade at check-in - not sure if this was linked or if this was because we were both celebrating birthdays over our trip - either way, we were very grateful. We were given the most incredible apartment in the annex, right next door. Our own little bolthole in Rome, except that it wasn't so little! The apartment was over two floors - two double bedrooms, two bathrooms, a huge living room and kitchen, and a view over the rooftops to the Forum. I didn't want to leave! Everything was perfect - the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and we both slept exceptionally well, with no street sound. We actually preferred being out of the main hotel.\nWe walked miles and miles, using the Metro only when arriving in from the airport. The hotel is a short walk to the Colosseum and a shorter walk to the Roman Forum and the Capitoline Museums. We also walked to/from the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona and Borghese Gallery and thought the location was just perfect - lots of lovely bars and restaurants nearby without the maddening crowds of some of the larger squares.\nSpecial mention has to be made about the lovely ladies who brought us our breakfast. My husband is coeliac and has to follow a strict gluten free diet. Both Valentina and Barbara were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful, with Barbara going above and beyond the call of duty. As a coeliac herself, she was wonderful - recommending restaurants and even bringing gluten free bread from home to make my husband 'safe' French toast. As someone who is struggling with the diagnosis and is wary about eating food away from home and at the mercy of others, we were both highly reassured and grateful for her kindness and thoughtfulness.\nI loved everything about this hotel and can't recommend it highly enough. If I'm ever lucky enough to go back to Rome, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Couldn't get near the Trevi Fountain, though, to throw a coin in though, so hoping that particular superstition isn't true ....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:03.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
