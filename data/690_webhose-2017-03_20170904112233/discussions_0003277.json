She finally agreed to try out the hotel. To her surprise we thought the hotel was up to the times, had everything one needed for a hotel stay to be satisfied, and most of all pure fun! The rooms are European style. They know how to relax. The bed was very comfortable and the electronics were extremely easy to use. The staff was extremely happy and all seemed to like their jobs. I don't know how family friendly the hotel is but I would definitely recommend it for couples to get away or for travelers.\nRoom Tip: Make sure you put your luggage under the bed. Saves on room.
