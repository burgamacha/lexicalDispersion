The hotel is a close walk about 10 minutes from the subway station and it was perfect for me who did not want to live in the most hectic part of London. The room was great and so was the breakfast. My only complaint is that I booked the room via Booking.com and the hotel reserved the total cost for the stay from my card about a week before, which was totally fine! But when I checked in, I had to pay AGAIN to \"reserve\" the amount, despite telling the staff that the amount had actually been drawn. When I later checked out, I had to PAY the total room charge, and had not yet received the reserved money back so I was out almost Â£400 for almost a month. Such a small detail that could be solved easily by the hotel, but is incredibly annoying for the guest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:03:39.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
