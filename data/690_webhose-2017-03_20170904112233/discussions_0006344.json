It is a great location, right in the heart of the Financial District, mere steps from the New York Stock Exchange and also very close to the NEW World Trade Center building. Upon check-in, Raymond was extremely helpful and friendly. LOVE the check-in method here. It's not like anything I have seen anywhere else. Instead of going to a Front Desk when I checked in, I was greeted by a guy with an iPad who approached me and he really simplified the check-in process and had me in my room in no time. And what a room it was very comfortable, modern, big, and spacious. Topping this all off, they offered complimentary snacks and fruits, We will certainly be returning to this wonderful place,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:01:19.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
