We stayed here on a Saturday. The staff was consistently friendly and helpful. Our rooms were roomie (which can't be said in every NYC hotel) with a king sized bed. The bathroom was spacious as well. It was in a great central location. We had the breakfast in the morning, which was a little more amped up from a typical Hilton Garden, but still fine for the convenience of just going downstairs to eat. We parked in the associated ICON 24 garage and it only cost us $47 for 24 hours of parking - which again is a bargain. I'd definitely stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:29:26.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
