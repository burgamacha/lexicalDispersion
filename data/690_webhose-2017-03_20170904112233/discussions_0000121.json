The experience was top notch - great rooms, fabulous bedding, bathrooms luxurious and the staff is over the top - they want you to enjoy your stay. I found out this is one of the last remaining family-owned hotels and you can certainly see that the family who owns The Goring takes care of their impeccable staff. The tea room is so enjoyable and filled with many interesting \"locals\". Best hotel experience!\nRoom Tip: My room - a king -- was quiet, extremely clean and I slept great.
