The eiffel tower based rooms are excellent and its quiet a view to lie down in bed and watch the tower glitter up every hour. The room was neat and clean with all basic amenities. If one does not want to spend money eating out, they can cook in the room itself. The sunday market right infront of the hotel gives the sight and pleasure of local eating.Breakfast food variety can be improved. No of english TV channels can be increased.The location is fabulous, right infront of Picquet de la Motte metro station. The place is filled with cafes, brasseries and boulangeries within 100m.\nRoom Tip: Choose the Eiffel tower view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:44:07.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
