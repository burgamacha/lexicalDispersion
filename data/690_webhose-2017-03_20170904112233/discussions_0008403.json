We cannot say enough about the staff at the hotel, they were amazing and answered my mountain of questions in advance of our stay quickly, even arranging a private tour of Hamley's, which was perfect for our 11-year old. From reservations, to reception to the dining areas, we have nothing but compliments and highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a smaller boutique hotel. We felt completely at home and safe here, walking to Paddington in minutes, Marble Arch in about 15 minutes and even a delicious pub was only minutes away as well. Truly cannot give this hotel and it's staff enough compliments, they were incredible!\nRoom Tip: Would recommend higher floors, with neighborhood view, very quiet, except for a few squeaky floors...
