It is situated about a 10 minute walk from north Behai station which is ok in the morning but a huge effort after a day of sightseeing. We felt safe walking at night in the hutong district. The hotel itself is clean and very charming. The WiFi works well throughout the hotel. Also, they store luggage if needed after checkout. The staff are very helpful and friendly. My only criticism was that the shower has very low water pressure and the breakfast is quite limited. Please note that the hotel has two floors and no elevator. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. Excellent value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:04:33.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
