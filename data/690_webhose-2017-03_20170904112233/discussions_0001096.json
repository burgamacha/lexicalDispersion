Free soft drinks in the room! (Room 502)\nBreakfast was good and we did like the open bar during the day and night.\nThe hotel is also in a great position near Pigalle and St George metro station;\nFrom the hotel you can reach with just a ten minutes stroll Montmartre/Sacre Coeur with lots of bars and restaurants or you can reach Opera' and La fayette Magasins on the opposite side.\nWe would highly recommend this hotel for the excellent quality/price ratio.\nRoom Tip: Room 502 , really nice and quiet at night See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:58:28.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
