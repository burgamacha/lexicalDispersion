Across the road from Penn station and Madison square again, next to a subway entrance. Unfortunately it's next to Macy's so the cards took a hammering thanks to my better half. The food in both the diner and trattoria attached to the hotel is very good,it is expensive but that's New York for you. Room was clean and comfortable,had a view of the Hudson River, which was a bonus. Staff were very efficient and friendly, would use again.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have a better view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:43:46.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
