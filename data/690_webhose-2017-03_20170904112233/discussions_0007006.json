Walk up hill towards Sacre Coure to the best areas. The hotel is in a very lively, bustling area, not for the prim, proper or naive amongst you. Lots of Restaurants bars & clubs within a mile & the Metro is a 5 minute walk.\nOnly criticism, no milk or teabags to make tea in the room when we arrived but when we asked it was supplied.\nClean room & bathroom, comfortable beds. Enjoyed our stay& would return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:51:25.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
