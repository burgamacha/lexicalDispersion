This was my 3rd visit to New York & my favourite hotel so far. Positives - I felt very safe in the hotel & the area it's located in. Location was fantastic....15 min walk to Time Square & 25 mins to Central Park. Hotel room was great....big for New York standards. Bed was huge & very comfortable. Best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Bathroom was big & modern. Shower was fab...again big & powerful. Staff were friendly & helpful. Negatives - I felt the carpet could have been cleaner. The hair dryer cord was so short that you could only use the socket in the bathroom & it was difficult to dry your hair. I would recommend lady travellers to bring their own hair dryer. The hotel bar didn't open during the day which was inconvenient - it would have been nice to have chilled there with a coffee / drink on arrival. Overall a great hotel & highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:58:01.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
