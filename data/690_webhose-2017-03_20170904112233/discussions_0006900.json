They upgraded us to a larger room which was a nice surprise and greatly appreciated. The room was just a little \"tired\" but lovely all the same and a great value considering the great location within walking distance to Notra Dame and the Place des Vosges. There is a wonderful Boulangerie a few doors down where we had a late lunch when we arrived - my sister and I agreed it was the best quiche ever and was served with a lovely crisp salad and of course we had a glass of wine with it. The staff spoke English and we're all very helpful, especially Benjamin. The clientele appeared to be very international which was nice. Our room was very quiet and clean - perfect for a good nights rest. I would definitely go there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:30:19.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
