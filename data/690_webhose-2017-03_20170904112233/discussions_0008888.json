We returned home a couple of days ago, just missed St Patricks parade unfortunately. Having just read some of the reviews on here I do feel that a bit of context is needed and some people want the world for a penny. I loved the Hotel! Yes I have stayed in better equipped ones but for what amounts to a city break why would I want a hotel with lots of spa type amenities and frills when I am here to explore the city, not the hotel! From the minute we arrived the staff could not have been more helpful, they made great recommendations for places to eat and tips on getting about the city. I even had a drink in the great little bar and a good natured political conversation with a couple of them on one night. Didn't get to see as much of NY as we wanted owing to the other visitor to the city (Storm Stella) so we are planning to go back as soon as we can. We will definitely be staying in the Distrikt, thanks to the team there!\nRoom Tip: Go high and check your view is facing the right way See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:28:31.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
