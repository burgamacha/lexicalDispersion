Very clean spacious bathroom, with fab showers & some hotel complimentary toiletries. Staff extremely nice and friendly. The breakfast was decent if you do not wish to venture out the hotel. we ordered room service and it was quick and delicious not badly priced either. Location great for the Eiffel tower otherwise a little far out from other tourist attractions. About a hour walk to the Louvre & arc de triumph champs elysee. Heating in the room was great especially after a cold day up the Eiffel tower.\nOverall i would recommend to anyone, however be prepared to walk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:58:39.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
