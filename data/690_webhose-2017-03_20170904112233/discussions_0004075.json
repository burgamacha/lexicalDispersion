We had a great view of Times Square and I loved having a 2 room suite with a family of 5. Short walk to Top of the Rock. We didn't make it to Central Park but hoping to go back soon! The hotel was very clean and updated nicely. We were high enough that the noise from Times Square didn't bother us at all. We drove in and valet parking was a nice perk and very easy. No wait at all. Highly recommend!\nRoom Tip: We paid extra for a room on a higher floor with a good view of Times Square.
