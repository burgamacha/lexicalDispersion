This hotel is in the heart of Paris and close to a lot of Paris attractions, namely the Eiffel Tower. It was a great base for our daily romps through the Paris. The rooms were small true to all of the other reviews with barely room to move around the bed. Between me an my husbands luggage it took up all of the spare space available. But, when you go to Paris it is not to stay in the room and when you are in the room the bed is all the space you need. I loved our stay at the Londres Eiffel, I loved the neighborhood, I loved the morning coffee and croissants with ham and jams and a fussy french woman who I never understood, the tiny elevator that barely held me, my husband and our luggage, I loved the Patisserie just a few doors down with hot tea and wonderful pastries, I loved the entire experience and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:46:14.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
