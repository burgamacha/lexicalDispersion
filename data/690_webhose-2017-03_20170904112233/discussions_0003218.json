The Holiday Inn Express Manhattan West lived up to my expectations for the two days that I stayed there recently. Even though we arrived hours before check in time, Josie at reception was able to get us a room immediately and even upgraded us to a higher floor. Our room wasn't the largest but it was clean and had all the necessary amenities. We had a lovely view of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline...thanks Josie! The hotel itself is situated in a quiet neighbourhood in Midtown West/Hells Kitchen within walking distance of restaurants, shops and a subway station. We loved the close proximity to Broadway, Times Square and Central Park. I would definitely stay here again and do recommend this hotel to others!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:47:45.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
