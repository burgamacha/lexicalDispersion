Found this hotel to be great in all aspects.\nLocation- Great for an airport stay. Very close to airport and free shuttle. Also great for a visit to San Francisco. It's a quick 10 minute drive up the freeway unless there is traffic. Then it's closer to 30 minutes. Set in a business park so it's very quiet. Also right on the bay with a nice hiking trail next to the property.\nRooms- Nicely appointed and clean. Fully equipped kitchen and full size fridge. Separate sitting area with sofa bed and desk. Furniture is not ultra modern but also not dated. Queen bed very comfortable.\nGeneral- Free parking. We often stay in South San Francisco and Brisbane and free parking used to be common. Lately we've noticed more hotels her charging. In the city it's ridiculous and $70 a night for parking is why we rarely stay in the city.\nNice breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, bagels, pastries, fruit, oatmeal and waffle machine.\nThere is also a light dinner with beer and wine included. We did not have a chance to check this out since we've been out. Free wifi.\nHighly recommend this property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:51:55.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
