Reception staff very friendly helpful and attentive. Room for two was spacious and clean. I always check under a bed for dustballs and this room was spotless. Breakfast had something for everyone. Roof terrace was a massive bonus and a lovely view to look out from, especially in the sun. The position of the hotel is fantastic. The rooms are soundproof and although there is some noise from the vechicles on via nacionale, we felt this added to the vibe of Rome and didn't concern us. Prosseco is of very good quality, which I feel shows the true reflection of the hotel it's all about quality. We would definitely return again. Please don't change a thing Rome Glam hotel â˜º free wifi excellent throughout the whole hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:42:54.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
