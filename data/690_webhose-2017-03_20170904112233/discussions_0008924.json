It is only a block from the tube and Brick Lane.\nThe rooms have an espresso machine and a mini fridge. There was a large walk in shower in the bathroom The only thing I found as a short (5'1') woman wrong was that the sink was quite high and awkward to use. The room was comfortable and quiet but for some reason there was a bluish nightlight by the front door that didn't seem to have a way to shut off. So if a completely dark room is necessary for sleep maybe they have rooms without that feature. We only stayed one night so didn't ask.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:48:04.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
