I really looked forward to returning to our room! Room was pretty spacious as NYC hotels go and the addition of a refrigerator, microwave is a nice feature. It is also a good value. My only suggestion is to raise the lights in the lobby just a bit. We appreciated the way the desk staff worked with us during the recent snow storm- allowing us to cancel an added night when it turned out we were able to catch a flight home was greatly appreciated! I rate sleep quality lower, because our room was on a low floor and dumpsters from construction across the street were bring emptied in the middle of the night. I would have liked the ability to request a room on a higher floor when making our reservation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:35:08.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
