I asked for a high floor so I could look out of the windows at the wonderful rooftops of Paris. What a way to awake - to open the window and see Paris all around! I asked for breakfast in my room and each day they brought it promptly on a nice tray with all of my requests fulfilled. Comfortable bed and comforter, very clean room, helpful day and night staff - all in all a great visit! I would definitely stay there again. And I do love that they send the pre-visit survey asking your needs. When I arrived they said \"Madame, all of your requests have been satisfied.\" They were correct. Thanks for everything!\nRoom Tip: I asked for a renovated room and it was very nicely done with a very modern bath.
