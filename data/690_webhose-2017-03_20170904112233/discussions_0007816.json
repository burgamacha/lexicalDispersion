Room om the 1st floor was very modern, very clean + quiet. The whole hotel is very modern + clean. Only 1 slight niggle was even with the temperature at 28 (highest) it was a little chilly for me. Lovely hot showers, tea + coffee in the room. Beds super comfy + lovely fluffy towels. I didn't go to the pool personally, but my partner said it was a bit cold for him.\nDespite being a little chilly, the hotel is in a fantastic location; literally a minute walk from Lambeth North tube station + 5 minutes walk from Westminster Bridge (Parliament, Big Ben, Dungeons, London Eye). I would definitely return to this hotel in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:25:23.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
