Price was excellent considering the time of year, and proximity to MSG.\nThis is one of Apple Cores remakes of an old building, remodeled into a quaint, cramped section of NYC. The rooms are a bit small, but redone quite nicely. Water pressure is excellent, the shower could remove bark from a tree.\nBed was super comfortable, breakfast was just okay (toast, fruit and yogurt) and staff were extremely accommodating and helpful.\nOnly downside is the noise. Construction noise begins bright and early from adjoining properties, and the doors slam shut quite loudly. Of course, if inconsiderate guests would keep them from slamming, it would be a non-issue.\nI don't believe any of the rooms has a decent view of the city, at least mine did not.\nRoom Tip: Choose a room in the wings of the building, NOT in the main section near the elevators.
