It's beautiful inside (the lobbies and our room we stayed in!) The bathroom in our room was gorgeous and stocked with high end soaps and shampoos. And the bed was comfortable and cozy. Only complaint would be a loud heating and cooling system that rattled very loudly in our room, but the hotel did provide earplugs which I was able to use to drown out the sounds. Overall, the loud noises didn't badly impact our stay and I'd stay here again. The location is fantastic. Right around the corner from Chelsea Market and a short train ride to the theater district where we went to two shows!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:03:55.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
