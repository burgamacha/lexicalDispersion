Perfect for the places we wanted to explore, close to tub and right outside are plenty of bus stops to jump on your bus tours. Great for some major tourist spots, westminister, big ben, london eye....\nRooms are gorgeous, very modern, clean and spacious, some views better than others but this will be our go to choice when visiting london again.\nThe breakfast was really good, staff very attentive upon our arrival, very friendly especially the main host, he was lovely. Food was always warm and loads on offer, kids helped themselves as much as they wanted on both mornings.\nWe used the swimming pool every day we were there, the kids loved it. Its no the best location in that you need to leave the health suite to get to it and they use codes which we always forgot because they changed them daily! But pool area was kept clean and tidy.\nAll in all, had a blast and will certainly visit this hotel again as a couple and as a family of five!\nRoom Tip: ask for room closer to reception as some corridors are very long!
