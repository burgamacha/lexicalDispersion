This doesn't really change anything, except that there's no hotel 'ambience' in the lobby. It is a work site during the day. But overall I had a great stay here. Considering the price I paid I actually think this place was an amazing value.\nCheckin: The check in area was tiny. If this were more then a 3* hotel I would've been disappointed. But the service was quick and excellent. I showed up at around 2pm and no room was available. But they guarantee checkin for 3pm, and by the time I returned(at 302pm) the room was ready.\nRoom: Not fancy. But it was clean, surprisingly large for Manhattan, and well equipped. It had a flat screen tv(that I never turned on), a kitchenette that had a stove/microwave/full fridge, and most important, a Hilton bed. I love how the 3* Candlewood has the same beds as any 5* Hilton anywhere in the world. What a great sleep.\nMy room was completely unaffected by the construction.\nnote: my reservation(via expedia) did read a Queen bed. We only ever received a double. But I didn't care much and by the time I was ready to do something about it my wife had already unpacked her clothing. this didn't effect my rating of the hotel as I never gave them a chance to do anything and it may very well be expedia's fault.\nLocation: Amazing. A few blocks off Times Square. I actually loved that in the other direction there's a number of non-tourist restaurants and grocery places less then a block away.\nServices: None\nOverall: Great stay. Unaffected by construction. Would absolutely stay again and would recommend to anyone that doesn't need fancy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:41:19.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
