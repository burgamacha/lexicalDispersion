The location, just two blocks from the Piazza Pocolo and the subway system, was perfect, placing us in excellent location close to the Spanish Steps, the two stop subway ride to St. Peter's, and easy access to the coliseum and meeting spots for the daily tours we enjoyed.\nThe hotel staff were most helpful, the breakfasts excellent, and the daily happy hour in the bar a pleasant way to finish our long days of site seeing.\nThe rooms are typically European and thus smaller than American standards but we were very comfortable and satisfied. The main benefit, though, is the hotel's location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:05.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
