A wonderful place, very quirky. Our room was fantastic. The bed was huge and the bath in the bedroom was luxurious. The hotel staff were incredibly kind, helpful and knowledgeable. The district is just fantastic - great atmosphere. A huge flea market popped up right outside on the weekend - which was amazing Transport links were second to none. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We would love to return soon. Can't recommend enough!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:46:52.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
