There were only four rooms on our floor. We were on the eighth floor, overlooking the park with a beautiful view of the Freedom Tower. The room was small, but had everything we needed and everything was clean. The bed was pretty comfortable, but the room never really cooled down to where we wanted it. Stephen worked the desk at night and was so helpful in recommending restaurants and giving us directions in Chinatown. Nice guy, and didn't steer us wrong once- thank you! The free breakfast in the morning was four doors down at MaMa. Comp. breakfast customers get a very limited menu, and the food wasn't that great. Three mornings in a row they didn't have hash browns, so they gave you french fries! However, the hotel is great! Perfect location, quiet neighborhood, quiet room. Heard no traffic noise in the room. Would love to stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:15:05.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
