I have stayed in quite a few Hampton Inns but this was the most pleasant visit. It all started with our friendly greeting by Carmel at the front desk. She smiled and was very helpful - not something one expects in New York City!\nOur room was very comfortable and the bathroom was surprisingly large for NYCity standards. We had a closet, drawers, an extra fridge and a desk area. Even though our room faced 24th street it was surprisingly quiet. There were only 8 rooms per floor.\nThe entire staff was always pleasant and greeted us with a \"good morning\" every time. The breakfast was good - with yummy NY bagels! My only complaint was that there wasn't always room to sit down!\nTransportation is nearby with many subway stations a block or 2 away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:22:03.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
