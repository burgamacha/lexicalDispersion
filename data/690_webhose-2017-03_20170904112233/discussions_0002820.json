The area wasn't the nicest because of the construction and just the area in general, but we never felt unsafe or actually saw any shady individuals hanging around. The breakfast that we had included was surprisingly good! Our room was small, but it was expected, we were hardly there so it did the job. The front door would be locked at night when we would come back, you just had to knock to get in. I would probably stay here again because of the location to the metro and reasonable price! It wasn't THAT far from the city either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:56:14.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
