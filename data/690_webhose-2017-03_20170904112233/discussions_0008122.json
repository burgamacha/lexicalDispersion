This was our first(of many to come) stay at The Renwick. We were impressed from the moment we entered. Had a little hiccup on arrival since all systems were down and we had a very long day waiting on our room. We were however upgraded to a studio, so no complaints!\nWe were very comfortable and felt quite at home.\nI would like to throw out several kudos to this amazing staff starting at the top with Rich, so kind, so helpful, so personable. The front desk staff, Nellie, Judy, and Jasmine--- you're great and thanks for dinner recommendation (Prime). Yum\nYour two doormen we dealt with, Nick----loved Rossini---very helpful on checkin too, and James--- thanks for heads up on transportation to airport. You're both great\nAnd of coarse I must mention the staff at Bedford &Co. We are such creatures of habit, we sat at same table every morning. All the staff was very accommodating, but I must give special mention to our very sweet, attentive favorite----Lisette!!\nAlso to Dawn, enjoyed our time chatting with you\nLast but not least----Tommy the head bartender. Great guy. Perfect for that job.\nAll this being said", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:48:13.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
