This is right in the midst of the flower district, a working, mid-town area. I gave it 5 stars, not because it was the most posh, but because it was exactly what I was looking for and they delivered.\nThis little hotel is about 5 short blocks from Penn Sta and Madison square garden. Good walking distance from all the shopping on 5th ave, etc. Short cab rides from almost everywhere in town, except the higher up East or West, of course.\nStaff is friendly, nice casual place for breakfast. rooms not large but clean. Comfy bed with lots of pillows. This is a great place for the value if you are not planning to hang out here all day... but in NYC, why would you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:03:29.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
