What a treat. The staff are wonderful, so pleasant and friendly without being intrusive. The bar is cozy and the service was the best. The room is a little on the small side but the amenities are good.\nI think what makes this hotel so enjoyable are the staff. The buffet breakfast is plentiful and the menu items offer a good variety. All things considered a great stay and a very convenient location very close to Green Park underground.\nThis is my third visit, would continue coming back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:14:17.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
