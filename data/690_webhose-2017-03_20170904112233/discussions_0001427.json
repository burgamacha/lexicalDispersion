I came to the hotel with the intention of proposing to my girlfriend, and the entire staff was more than happy to accommodate us in any way. Beyond this kindness, the hotel is magnificent in every way.\nLocation: The Property is located a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées and all the main attractions in the city.\nStaff: The staff are remarkably attentive, helpful, friendly and the true stars of the experience.\nHotel Quality: The rooms are modern, well designed, technologically advanced and spacious. The facilities, from the common areas, to the large fitness center, to the pool, were top quality.\nF&B Outlets: The main F&B dining room was elegant, with small concerts in the afternoon. The rooftop terrace was lovely and I hope to experience it in the summer when sitting outside would be viable.\nThe Peninsula Paris will occupy a special place for me, especially since she said yes. I look forward to returning on a honeymoon. It is worth every penny, and more.\nRoom Tip: You can't go wrong.
