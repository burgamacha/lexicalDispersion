Especially for the hourly Eiffel Tower sparkles. The food at the hotel was also delicious. We ordered room service and had the breakfast buffet. I recommend both, although they are pricey $$$$. I believe breakfast was $50 USD for two of us.\nOur room was comfortable and clean. We did have one problem with the shower leaking onto the bathroom floor, which we should have brought up. There was also a wedding happening one night with blasting music until 12am. Not horrible, but also a bit inconvenient when paying $250+ per night.\nOverall I would recommend this hotel. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodations were good. The views are just magical!!\nRoom Tip: View of Eiffel tower is a MUST See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:59:50.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
