The hotel was clean and the front desk service was impeccable. The recommendations given for restaurants was spot on. The location was ideal. A 5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and a 2 minute walk to Ecole Miltiare metro stop as well as 1 block walk to Les Invalides. Mauricio was so helpful the entire trip and arrange car service to Charles de Gaulle for us. I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were very nice. Like Most of Europe we needed 2 rooms for the 4 of us but the furnishings were modern. The hotel provided each room with a cellphone with free data and phone calls while in France which let us communicate easily and navigate directions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:26:42.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
