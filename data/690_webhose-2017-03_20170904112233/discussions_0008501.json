It's withing walking distance of Notre Dame and the museums and was a great base for a romantic weekend in Paris. The room was beautifully decorated, and surprising quiet considering how close we were to the centre of town. There are numerous fantastic restaurants close by and the closeness of various parks made the stay very peaceful when we needed to get away from the noise and bright lights of the more tourist areas. We would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:28:16.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
