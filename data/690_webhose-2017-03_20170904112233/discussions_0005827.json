I was a little hesitant due to the distance and transportation to the main areas however having a metro station in the corner and others at 1 or 2 blocks was a plus and it was not an issue. When we hanged out until very late we took an Uber from Notre Dame to the hotel and was around 12-15 Euros. The surrounds were nice, different options of restaurants, a good boulangerie in the corner (coffee/bread shop) and in general the area looked safe. Very good service in the front desk, small rooms (as many in Paris), very clean/modern style restroom, very small elevator (2 persons capacity top-no luggage) but it was not an issue. In general a good place to stay - have the basics- if your plan is to have a place to sleep in a clean and nice area.\nRoom Tip: the high floors See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:35:03.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
