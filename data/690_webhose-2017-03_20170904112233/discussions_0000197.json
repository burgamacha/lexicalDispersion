From the moment we entered we were greeted warmly and treated to professional topnotch service throughout our stay. We enjoyed a spacious junior suite that exceeded our expectations in comfort and style. Our room was furnished with a variety of classic and contemporary biographies; would have loved to stay another day and read in the room or in the homey second floor area. Breakfast snacks and coffee were appreciated in the morning; an ideal arrangement of snacks and wine were perfect for our pre-Broadway evening excursions. The rooftop lounge is an inviting space that we look forward to visiting when we visit in warmer weather.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:33:49.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
