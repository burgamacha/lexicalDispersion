Traveling to NYC with our last teen this was the smallest HS we have been in - very compact and a bit too small for 5 nights and luggage but we made it work. No managers reception but cookies around 4pm. Breakfast was standard and if early enough space not a problem but it is during the rush. Easy walk to subway and times square but tough to find a cab. Quiet if not on the street side and great views from the 22 floor. Friendly front desk staff. We'd stay again for the location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:19:11.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
