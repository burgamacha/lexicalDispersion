The hotel is old and out dated but it's still a relatively nice hotel, bed is really comfy and room is spacious! We stayed here for the location and not the luxury.\nThere is WIFI in the hotel which does cost but you get really good signal and speeds for the price. You will also get billed $100 deposit when you arrive for any extras you get.\nMy only negative about the hotel is the fact that the heating comes on for only 20 minutes then it is off for 30 minutes and when it gets turned on it sounds horrendous, the loud noise of the pipes and other noises that it sounds like there is animals living in the walls. My other is the shower head, they could be replaced for more updated shower heads... they're like prison shower heads.\nOther than that, I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it if you ain't bothered about luxury. We would stay again if the price was still good.\nAlso worth noting, the bar is way expensive. $32 for a double whiskey and coke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:32:03.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
