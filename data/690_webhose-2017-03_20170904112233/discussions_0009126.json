We got a good room rate and we added a parking package on which was $10.00 a day to park your car. The hotel has been updated, so the room had great beds and a nice bathroom. The room was cleaned in a timely fashion. The common areas of the hotel were very nice. Staff was informative and answered all our questions. The internet service was great. There is a hotel service fee that is added to your bill that includes internet along with other services.\nThat being said, when my daughter arrived home, she found clothing items missing from her bag. I called the next day and spoke to the head of security. He was very polite and said he would speak with the staff. I realize my daughter will not get back her clothing items , but I wanted the hotel to be aware of the actions that took place. My recommendation would be to not only use the safe for valuables , which is provide by the hotel in your room, but to also lock your suitcases when you leave.\nTo conclude, I would stay here again. It was a great hotel , with a great location ! And we had a great time in NYC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:26:38.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
