The location is perfect for tourists because it's walking distance to everything you'd like to see (Time Square, Central Park, Moma Museum, Met Museum) and if you'd like to visit anything else the concierge will organise it in a heartbeat. We went to a lovely Asian Fusian restaurant around the corner from the hotel as well as a breakfast diner, both recommended by the staff and we enjoyed both meals very much. As I mentioned before it's pricey to stay at the Four Seasons - especially in New York, but it was well worth the money we paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:00:36.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
