First of all, the location is perfect. You are a step away from the tube, and in the heart of adorable South Kensington, with bus lines and bike shares right outside your door. For us the location was perfect, as we spent a good amount of time in Chelsea, as well as the Soho-Covent Garden area, so we were right in the middle! The angel check in lady allowed us to check into our room at 9am after an overnight flight. A 2 hour nap is a MUST after a short red-eye. The room was on the ground level, but it was the only one available, so she offered for us to change room to a higher floor the following day, which we declined. The room was fine, though it lacked privacy when the drapes were pulled. The standouts at the Ampersand were the 1) free non-alcoholic mini bar (which was replenished every day!), 2) heated bathroom floors, and 3) the free cell phone they give you to use around the city. The phone itself was a little clunky and slow, but it was great for us, as i had an international plan, but could give the phone to my boyfriend when he would inevitably get lost! We unfortunately didn't get a chance to eat or drink at the hotel, but it will most definitely be our choice next time in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:27:01.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
