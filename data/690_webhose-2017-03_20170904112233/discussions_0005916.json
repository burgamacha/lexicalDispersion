I thoroughly enjoyed our beautifully appointed room and the lovely breakfast's that were included in the rate. Sadly, I doubt that I'll ever convince my husband to return due to the size of our room.. Upon arrival we were advised we had been \"upgraded\", however, when we opened the door we actually laughed out loud - the room was MINUTE! Barely enough space to move around the bed, let alone open 2 suitcases. While the other aspects made up for it for me, the cramped space was too unbearable for my hubby. Will definitely pop into the cozy bar area for a drink should we ever return to the area!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:54:39.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
