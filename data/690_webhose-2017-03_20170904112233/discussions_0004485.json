The main floor staff were always available for questions without issue (where to go?, what to do?; the standard basic tourist questions from someone new to Beijing). The room was always clean and stocked when I returned in the afternoon from wandering the city. When used, the food in the executive lounge was fresh and the selections diverse. When we walked in, the staff always welcomed us with a smile and asked if we would like a drink (water, soda, wine, etc.). Always available and extremely attentive! All in all, everyone at the Hilton Beijing Wangfujing made my stay in Beijing the expected experience I was looking for in a vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:10:31.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
