The location is great....very near the Gloucester Rd. tube stop (Piccadilly Line) which gets you anywhere in London very easily. The rooms are very small, as is typical of European hotel rooms, but have everything you need including a kettle and items to make tea. The breakfast was great....many choices and good service. The price is also very, very good for what you get. The only real negatives were that the rooms are a bit noisy....Cromwell Rd. is a fairly busy road and also we had a hard time controlling heat in our room was too hot so we resorted to opening the windows which only made it more noisy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel though as the negatives are very minor.\nRoom Tip: Rooms away from Cromwell Rd. would be quieter.
