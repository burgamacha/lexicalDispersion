As you approach the hotel, the front of the building does not give a good first impression which is a pity because once inside, although looking a little dated, the place is spotlessly clean with attentive professional staff.\nOur room was on the top floor of five and overlooking the street. It was a reasonable size with a comfortable bed and good wardrobe and drawer space. Although the front of the hotel is on quite a busy street, the room was quiet and we had a good night's sleep.\nThe bathroom was modern and had a shower over the bath. There were good quality bathrobes and slippers. Tea and coffee making facilities are available in the rooms.\nThe continental breakfast is good with a hot option at a modest extra charge if you require it.\nIf you are on a budget but still want a comfortable decent quality mid range hotel in a central London location, this is a good choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:16:44.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
