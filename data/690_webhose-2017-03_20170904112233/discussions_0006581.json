It wasn’t perfect, but there really was little to complain about. We were in room 107, a junior suite at the front of the hotel with a fantastic view across the square and the Pantheon right next door.\nThe suite was a little smaller than I was expecting. There were no bedside drawers, and there was no point in opening the side windows as they looked straight out at the walls opposite across the lane. The square is very busy, with many tourists, buskers, beggars etc. I normally use earplugs to sleep at night, but didn’t bother there and didn’t find the noise intrusive. In fact it was good to hear the buzz of the city.\nThe position of the hotel is so good in many ways. Walking is easy to many sites, and you are only minutes away from churches with Caravaggios and Rafaels on the walls. The staff pointed us to some great restaurants, one only 30 seconds round the corner. Staff also booked transport from and to the airport. The day we arrived, there was a taxi strike. The booking staff, (Laura) went out of her way to describe other transport options in the minutest detail, and at the last minute managed to get a car for us.\nIn spite of the warm weather for March, the terrace bar on the roof was not open. We could sit up there but not order a drink. The hotel bar itself opened at 1730. In fact we only found out there was a roof bar after three days by seeing the note in the small folder containing our room keys. What surprised us was that there was no hotel directory in the room. There was no information available about hotel services. Whilst the reception staff were great at answering our questions, it would have been nice to be able to read about the place and what they did or didn’t offer.\nThe hotel does not have a restaurant, so there is no room service either, but we had read that on the website.\nThere were plenty of options for breakfast - but don’t go expecting a full English breakfast! Toast can be made on an interminably slow toaster, and there is scrambled egg and also bacon. Plenty of cereals, yoghurts, cheeses, cold meats, croissants, fruit and rolls though.\nWould we stay again, and would we recommend it? The answer is ‘yes’ to the first question and ‘we already have’ to the second.\nRoom Tip: Book a suite at the front overlooking the square. The hotel faces west, so there is evening sun.
