We could not have been happier with the service received. A week before arriving I was checking out the reviews on here which seemed to be very hit or miss, as me and my partner work in the hotel industry we emailed the hotel expressing our concerns. We arrived at the hotel around 2pm and check in wasn't until 4pm, the staff at the front desk were very friendly and told us that our room wasn't ready yet but they had upgraded our room to a suite, we we're both so pleased with this as we had only booked a standard one bed room. We we're asked to come back at 4pm ready for check in where our room would be ready.\nThe room we we're given was room 1026 which was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING we could honestly not pick a fault with it, it was spacious, clean and modern. A spacious living area, 2 wardrobes, a Tv a fridge and a freezer and the room had 2 BATHROOMS!! The bedroom was great too with a comfortable bed and another TV! Not that you'd sit and watch TV it NYC anyway! On the second night when we arrived back at our room we we're pleasantly surprised too see a bottle of champagne and a tray of strawberrys dipped in chocolate had been delivered up to our room complimentary! What a lovely little touch!\nDuring our 4 night stay we got caught up in the snow blizzard, which was expected to be 'very bad' we had a letter under our door from the hotel explaining to us that due to the snow storm the hotel may be short on staff so if the room wasn't cleaned on this day they do send their apologises. This was completely understandable but again what a nice touch from the hotel re-assuring us! Apart from this one day our room was cleaned every day too a good standard.\nThe hotel lobby is amazing, it is very dark but we loved it, we found it very relaxing and the scented candles they have in the lobby are fantastic.\nThere is also a room to leave your luggage when arriving early for check in which is free, however when you check out, if you need to leave your luggage at the hotel they do charge you... I think it was like $2.00 per bag not a lot.\nThe hotel is also situated right next to Times Square it is like a 2 minute walk to the left of the hotel, PERFECT LOCATION! At night it's not noisey and your away from the bright lights of Times Square.\nA HUGE THANK YOU to the paramount hotel for making our stay in NYC extra special we will definitely be recommending yourselves to other people!!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:04:22.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
