We were in our Honeymoon and he gave us the best possible view, we could see the Memorial and one of the avenues going up to the Midtown. The room was amazing, very cozy and clean, the sidewall was totally made of glass, meaning glass windows or some sort of that. The kitchen save us from a lot of challenges regarding food in NYC, nicely covered with dishes and stuff. One drawback was the noise coming from the closing doors of our neighbors, either the americans like to hit doors or the acoustic wasn't that great. Free refilling to our bottles with fresh water, free snacks, Soda and M&M's to the guests, man... Amazing!! Easy check-out, easy check-in, nice and beautiful staff, great location, even the voice in the elevator was gorgeous! For sure worth the money in a good range for NYC, best option to go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:23:31.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
