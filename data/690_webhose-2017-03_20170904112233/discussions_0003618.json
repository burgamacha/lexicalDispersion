The hotel is brilliantly located being across the road from the Metro and not too far from Gare du Nord which is where we arrive in Paris.\nWe had a lovely comfortable room with a separate kitchen which for our two night stay we didn't use, but would have been good to have, were we staying for longer. The room was bigger than you often find in Paris hotels of a similar rating. We also had a spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower.\nThe hotel is not in one of the most charming streets in Paris, but within walking distance there were some great restaurants and good shopping. There are lots of interesting places you can walk to from the hotel and with the station just across the road travelling to other areas is easy. So all in all it met our needs perfectly.\nRoom Tip: Worth paying extra for view of Eiffel Tower See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:24:41.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
