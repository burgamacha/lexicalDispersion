The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the historical Marais, yet in a very quiet street. A small hotel - less than a dozen rooms - it is very cosy and has a lot of style (each room or suite that I have occupied was decorated differently and had a different character). As important if not more, the people are lovely and always dedicated to to make sure your stay is perfect. In a nutshell, every time I visit the DS I feel at home. Wherever you come from, do not hesitate, the DS will do a lot towards making your Paris stay a dream...\nRoom Tip: The room and suite on the top floor are smaller but very intimate See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:33:33.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
