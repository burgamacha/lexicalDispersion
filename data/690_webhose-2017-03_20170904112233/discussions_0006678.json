We moved to London for work and needed to stay in hotels while waiting for our house. We chose the Royal park while we explored Kensington- So happy we did! The Royal Park hotel is a gorgeous hidden gem in Kensington. Great location a short walk from the beautiful italian gardens and plenty of restaurants. The hotel itself is lovely. There is a small bar with a great menu. The staff went above and beyond- Very professional and extememly nice. We brought our small dog and everyone was very sweet to our pet. We were given a fruit basket and note upon arrival and departure. You are also delivered fresh baked cookies in a cookie jar in your room with glass bottles of cold water everynight. Wonderful little surprises everywhere reminds me of the service that you would find at the Four Seasons Hotel. I also noticed how clean our rooms were after house keeping. Most hotels do a quick clean- not the Royal park, they wiped down tables, vacuumed and smelled clean. We have stayed in many hotels and have not seen anything quite like it. We were very pleased with everything! Thank you again :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:46:23.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
