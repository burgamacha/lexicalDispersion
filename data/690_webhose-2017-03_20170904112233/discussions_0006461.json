Looking at the various opportunities, I decided to book Pulman Hotel St. Pancras for my stay. The reviews on this hotel were positive, and after my experience, I can definitely confirm it. I checked in quite late in the evening, and I was kindly welcomed by a lady that gave me full explanation on the hotel facilities. Regarding the room and the hotel services: the bad was awesome , the breakfast rich and delicious, the restaurant staff always smiling and friendly. Sunday morning for the check out, I have been assisted by a front desk agent, whose name was Alim, that was behaving in a very professional way, and looked really concerned about my satisfaction. I received the invoice via e-mail, so no waste of time and paper. I suggest Pulman Hotel for both business and leisure stays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:44:14.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
