My 13 yr old daughter and I arrived very early from our overnight flight on a rainy morning. They immediately said they would have a room ready in 30 min - well before check-in time. From that moment until our last, the staff was friendly, courteous, and sincerely interested in ensuring we had a wonderful trip. The facility is very small but perfect for us. It is very modern, clean, and well equipped. The location is outstanding if you want a true Parisian experience. It is nestled in a quiet neighborhood a short walk from many iconic sites. We got our fresh squeezed orange juice from the market below, our cafe au lait from the restaurant across the street and anything else we needed with a few doors down along the cobblestone street. It is well positioned near a couple metro stops for quick access to the entire city. We absolutely loved the experience!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:48:50.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
