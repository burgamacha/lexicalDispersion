Had very much enjoyed a previous stay here 4 years ago, on that occasion daily housekeeping was included, not so this time, it was an extra cost of Â£15 per day, which was a little disappointing.\nHad a lovely studio room overlooking the street. Room was a good size with a good kitchenette and a good sized fridge.\nBathroom has plenty of room to put own things, but could do with a grab rail for safety as shower is over a somewhat deep and narrow bath.\nA couple of coat hooks near the door for cold weather coats would be helpful. Could also use a light to illuminate the clothes cupboard as it is very dark inside even in daylight.\nOverall a very pleasant stay. Will definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:18:14.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
