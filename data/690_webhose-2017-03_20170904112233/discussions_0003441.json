This was very nice hotel close to Central Park. Stayed here for my husband's 30th birthday along with seven other parties and we all enjoyed our stay here. Lobby has a great \"wow\" factor with the decor. Rooms were cute and very clean, small but unless you're planning on staying in all the time, not sure why anyone would, then they're perfect. The staff was great and made sure everyone in our party was taken care of. Jade, front desk, was superb, friendly and provided excellent customer service; Jade really took care of us. The property is super close to all major tourist attractions in NYC and within walking distance to all the subway stations. Central park was literally two blocks away. Multiple restaurants/Starbucks near by as well. The hotel had two restaurants and several lounges to choose from for food and drinks, all had good food and drinks. The only con would be that the walls in the hallways are super thin and you can seriously hear everything other guests are doing so don't be too loud when handling your business...just saying. Elevators were fast and never waited more than a minute. Wifi was pretty fast and free.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have better room views, bring air freshner as rooms do not have ventilation.
