On arriving at the hotel you are unaware how close to Times Square you actually are. When we got to our room we had a fantastic view of the new year ball on the top of times square. We stayed in a King room with city view, the room was very spacious and had a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. There was also a good sized safe in the room for locking away personal items. The bathroom had a large walk in shower which was very clean, we had plenty of towels and complimentary toiletries were replenished every day. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the room was a nice even temperature. There are 3 lifts which are controlled by your room key which gives extra security in the hotel as you can only get as far as the reception if you dont scan your key. The hotel location was just round the corner from Times Square and was very central for most shops and attractions. Would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Room 2405 gave you a view of the times square ball.
