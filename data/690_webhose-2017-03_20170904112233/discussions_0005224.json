Yes, the rooms are very small, smaller than NYC but I think that is to be expected at this price in Paris. The staff was very friendly and the location is great. It is very close to the station which goes straight to the airport but is also on a side street so away from the noise of the hustle and bustle. It was a short stay for us but would recommend if you don't plan to spend much time in the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:00:12.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
