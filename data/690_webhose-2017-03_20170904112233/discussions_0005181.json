This overall was the nicest hotel we stayed in so far.\nIt has what I think is the best location. Right opposite Tullieres. The rooms are nice, not incredible but smart & comfortable. But the view from your window from our executive room was just to die to for. The Louvre to the left, Eiffel Tower to the right, just unbeatable. Staff are incredibly friendly. Breakfast was nice too. Would've given a 5 star, but we found check in and check out very slow. Arrived at 1.45, room was not ready for 40 mins. Then check out took forever. Almost missed our trip because of it. Word of advice guys, have more staff on desk between 12-3pm. It is the busiest time for Hotels! However, I would certainly go back and so do recommend.\nRoom Tip: Get an Executive room, it's worth the extra See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:45:54.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
