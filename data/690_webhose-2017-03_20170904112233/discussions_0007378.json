The room was great, and on the bigger side compared to some of the places I have stayed in London. The hallway like entrance to the room was basically an amazing walk in closet. My room faced the street, and unfortunately there seemed to be loud drunk young people out on the street every night, but that isn't the fault of the hotel. The staff did their best to get me into a room when I showed up earlier than the check in time of 2 pm. On the whole, I was happy with this hotel and would gladly stay here again. It's a short, safe walk to the subway too.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:40:18.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
