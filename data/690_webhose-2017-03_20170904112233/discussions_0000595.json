The staff were super friendly, there is ample parking, it's easy to find, amenities (gas, dining, Walgreens) near by and the the rooms are recently renovated. I was a bit wary having a room on the 1st floor so close to the lobby but it was surprisingly quiet!\nMy only complaint was the air freshener in the room...FAR TOO MUCH! I had to open the window for 30 minutes to try and air it out a bit. Otherwise, I enjoyed my one night stay here and would recommend if you are passing through or flying into/out of SFO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:42:11.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
