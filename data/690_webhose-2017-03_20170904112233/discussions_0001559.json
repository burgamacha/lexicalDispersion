It's modern and comfortable, with free espresso in the lobby and happy hour snacks and beer. Our standard room was bit small, but not many rooms in Paris are big, and had all the amenities you would expect from an American hotel. The breakfast buffet had the same offerings every day, but it was a nice option to have. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Saint Martin Canal and Republique - which are much quieter areas than further south by the River Seine. We enjoyed walking these areas during our downtime when we were not sightseeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:27:44.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
