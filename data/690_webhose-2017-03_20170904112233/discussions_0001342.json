They were well situated on 6th Avenue, near some great shopping and lots to do within walking distance. They are close to the Empire State building, Madison Avenue and 10 minutes walk to Times Square.\nOverall, was satisfied with the hotel, however, I did not like the beer they had in the bar, they only had craft beers, I tried every single one and could not find one I liked. I would suggest they carry at least one or two of the better known or international beers for guests that do not like craft beers. I normally enjoy most beers, so was extremely surprised that I did not like one of the 5 I tried. We ended up going to a pub down the street to find some European beer.\nAll in all, an ok stay. If you are going to get a tour, I suggest you do it with the vendors on the street and not at the hotel. The hotel prices are not accurate, they are from last year, and the people at the tour companies lose out on their commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:45:09.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
