I emailed the hotel in advance to advise and they kindly gave us a complimentary room upgrade.\nWe stayed in room 1008 and it was huge! Nice, comfortable double bed and bathroom with bath and separate shower. 2 windows with 1 having a view of the street below and the other looked across to the other side of the hotel. Room was nice and warm and cleaned every day with fresh towel. Maids were fantastic!\nThe hotel has a wonderful, grand lobby with marble floor and a Starbucks, bar and gift shop on lobby level. There are around 5 or 6 lifts to get you to your room and s concierge service to look after your suitcases on the last day. It is easy to get a taxi from the front of the hotel also and there are staff members at the front of the hotel waiting to help you book taxis.\nThe location is perfect! Turn right from the front of the hotel and walk for 3 minutes straight down and you are at Times Square! Or turn left out of the hotel and then take a right and you're a 10-15 minute walk from Empire State!\nWould highly recommend this hotel. Some of the decor is a bit dated but the location and rate for the hotel is second to none! Will definitely be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:40:33.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
