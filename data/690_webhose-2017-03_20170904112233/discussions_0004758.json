The location is between second and third Avenue on 44 street and the rooms are fit for a business traveler. I say this because the rooms are equipped with fitness equipment which is quite unusual for any hotel in New York, along with great wifi and plenty of outlets at the desk.\nThe rooms are on the small side, however the hotel is very new and worth a look. For the price, amenities and service I gave this hotel at five star. If you're a business traveler I would definitely say you should check this one out as it has plenty of tables and couches in the lobby area that allow you to have a private meeting.\nThe rooms are equipped with mood lights that allows u to change the lighting in the room based upon ur mood never saw that before! In the gym right off the lobby is fully equipped for a great workout.\nI would definitely stay here again.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:15:33.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
