Good closet space, mini fridge, desk, lots of places to charge things. The bathroom was nice but you had to literally turn sideways to get past the sink to the loo and the shower. Otherwise, nice large soaking tub and housekeeping excellent. The lobby, restaurants, outdoor space is amazing! Lovely, comfortable, and never too crowded. Good location to walk to St James's Park tube station (0.2 miles) and to Victoria Station (0.4 miles). Safe area, food cafes, always a cab available! Staff is very accomodating.\nRoom Tip: Get a room with a window! If you nap during the day, the school side has recess~LOUD but truly fun...
