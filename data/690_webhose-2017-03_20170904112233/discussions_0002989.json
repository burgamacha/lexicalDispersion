The rooms are clean, the breakfast is good and the location is as well. In walking distance from some good restaurants, these is also a mini market about 300 yards from the front door that even sells fresh vegetables & fruit. You are in walking distance (15 min) from some of the higher end Paris resturants as well. The Montparnasse train station is very close as well. The bar is expensive here so its worth talking a short walk in either direction for cheaper drinks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:05:08.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
