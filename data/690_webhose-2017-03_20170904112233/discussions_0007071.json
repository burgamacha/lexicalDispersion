The staff were friendly and after arriving into New York earlier than expected, they were able to check us in to our room early as it was already ready (bonus!) The room was lovely and clean. Big, comfortable bed and the bathroom was also a great size. Complimentary shampoo, conditioners and body lotions were a nice added touch. The location of the hotel was perfect for us.. close by to Times Square and Empire State Building was just across the road! As the hotel is located just off the main streets it meant that it was nice and quiet at night (to get some much needed rest and sleep). The price included breakfast and this was also brilliant! Great choice of food and drinks and the waffle machine was a definite favourite. Another plus side of staying here was that on check out day they were happy to keep our luggage until our transfer time to the airport which was really handy for us as our flight wasn't until 8pm. Absolutely loved this hotel, would 100% stay again and would 100% recommend!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:52:49.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
