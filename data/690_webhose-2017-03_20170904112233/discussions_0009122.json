Perfect location, decent size rooms by London standards, great staff could not be more helpful.\nThe only downside is the bathrooms are a tight squeeze but everything you need is there. Also the corridor can be a little noisy, every noise from the corridor travels into the room, luckily I'm an early riser but could be annoying for some.\nComplimentary Fresh fruit, Nespresso and water in the rooms, and the great free handy wifi phone perfect for overseas visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:33:41.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
