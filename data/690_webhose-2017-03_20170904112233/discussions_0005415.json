The breakfast was on point with everything needed to have a full breakfast with lovely pastries, small crepes and eggs. The service was exceptional with every request we had no matter what time. The hotel is perfectly located away from all the loudness of Paris as its behind the Eiffel tower, but you are still close to everything. The hotel provided us with amazing memories, I could not thank them more . 5 stars", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:19:41.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
