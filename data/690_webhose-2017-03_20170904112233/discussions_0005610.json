We walked out of the RER (metro train system) which was one direct train from the airport, so easy! And the hotel was probably less than 20 steps away from the station. The hotel is a stones throw away from Notre Dame. I would say that a good 2 miles around the hotel is full of bars restaurants and shops! Absolutely perfect! We were advised to get travel tickets For during the day getting around of the of main sightseeing places but we decided to walk it all. We walked approx 8 miles in one day covering Notre Dame, Lourve museum, champs eleesey, arc de triumph and Eiffel Tower! The hotel itself I found perfect for the location and great value for what we paid for it. Yes the rooms are quite small, but we hardly spent any time in there, only getting ready to go out and sleeping. I've read a few reviews that moaned about how small the lift was... I must say, it was obserdly small, but we used it a max of 4 times a day... Definitely not a deal breaker! The only thing I would say is there wasn't any English/music channels on the lovely TV in the bedroom, but again, not a deal breaker. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris for a city break! We loved it there and would love to go back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:28:35.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
