Booked with Premier Inn in Brixton as more central hotels were a whole lot more expensive, and I've previously visited Brixton so felt happy to go back.\nThe hotel is right around the corner from the tube station, so getting around is easy. It's next door to a big pub/club, and on a street of noisy venues, but we couldn't hear a single external noise from our room. We didn't eat in the hotel because there are so many great places nearby, but the menu looked okay and prices were reasonable enough for a London hotel. Staff were really friendly and helpful - easy to check in and out, and answered questions happily. The room was very clean, beds were very comfortable, and the air-con was easy to use to ensure we weren't too hot.\nOverall, a great experience, and will definitely be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:28:39.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
