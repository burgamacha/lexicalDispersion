It is a chain hotel, but very nice for 3 stars. This one is just around the corner of Big Ben or Waterloo station (5 min to both). However in the center of London and near two hospitals, it was very calm and rather quiet place to stay. Rooms are ok (there is tv, tea making complect, small table, hagers, hair dryer, extra pillows and blankets), staff very friendly, breakfast was ok (the choise not very big, but you can sure find something for yourself: I missed two things - cheese and fresh fruits.Bathroom was very clean with a bath tube (!). The only problem in bathroom - shower ir permanently fixed on the wall, not possible to move or take in a hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:27:21.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
