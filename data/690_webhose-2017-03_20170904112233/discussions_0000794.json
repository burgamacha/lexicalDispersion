It could have easily accommodated 4 people. Had a kitchen, large seating area with a large bedroom in a separate room and a walk in closet. You get the sense it was an apartment building in a prior life and it could use some updating. The bathroom had a window in the shower that was open and had no curtain even though there was hardware for it and the tiled shelf below the window was cracked which all seemed kind of 2star-ish. Once I closed and locked the window it was fine.. well warmer anyway.\nThe beds were comfortable and the staff that I ran into were all friendly. My rate for the night was $345. Slightly less than 4 star but I'll round up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:04:09.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
