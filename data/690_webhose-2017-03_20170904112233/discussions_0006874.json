We could have stayed in an apartment in NY but we decided to stay overnight at the Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Midtown on 48th and Lexington. Boy did we make the right decision! This hotel was great, and the hotel staff was even better!\nWe were treated to an upgrade in rooms. When we got to the room, there was a card from the staff wishing us a happy anniversary. There was also complimentary water and delicious cookies.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our weekend overnight at this Residence Inn and thank the entire staff for helping us make our anniversary a great one.\nI highly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:01:39.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
