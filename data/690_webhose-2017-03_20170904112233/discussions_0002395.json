The bed was large and comfortable but there was little room to move with both of us in the room. The breakfast was also basic and delivered to the room. We had no issues using the lift (we were on the fifth floor). It is a great location with the metro/station as well as sight seeing all in walking distance. The centro restaurant just a few doors to the left was amazing, served the best steak I've had (although steer clear of the cocktails!)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:23:27.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
