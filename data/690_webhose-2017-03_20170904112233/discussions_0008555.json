The location is excellent with lots of good restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance. The rooms were spacious and clean. The only thing that we didn't like was the low powered light bulbs. The room was dark even with the lights turned on.\nWe did have some difficulty understanding the concierge and having him understand us.\nBreakfast was great with lots of choices! We did some shopping in the hotel gift shop.\nWe would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:57:12.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
