The small room was as comfortable as could be, efficiently designed, and technologically up to the minute. Staff were all very warm and helpful, check-in was a breeze, common areas were inviting and very comfortable. The location is great: close to everything while still on a relatively quiet street.\nI did not eat at the restaurant but had a great martini at the lobby bar.although I had the urban queen room (lowest price point) I had a nice view of the Empire State Building. An unexpected added plus. The room was nice and quiet. Very little street noise despite being on the 7th floor and no noise at all from neighbors.\nThis place isn't for everyone. While I enjoyed the room's layout which let watch tv while I brushed my teeth, it does not offer much privacy if you are traveling as a couple. Also, there is a small desk area but if you need to spread out and do serious work from your room, this might not be the place for you. (There are quiet common areas with work tables available). For me though, this was the perfect home away from home in NYC.\nRoom Tip: Urban Queen Room was very nice and quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:58:00.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
