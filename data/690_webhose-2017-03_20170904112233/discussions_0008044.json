Queen deluxe room was very big and loads of space. Clean sheets and towels very comfortable bed. Perfect location in the centre of everything couldnt of picked a better location for sightseeing and the westend for theatre. I will definitely return the hotel staff were so kind and helpful even surprised my friend with a birthday card and some cake such a lovely gesture really made her stay feel more special. The only thing I could say that's anyway critical was maybe they could update there carpet from cream to a different colour because it looked a bit grubby but I checked the sheets towels etc spotless..I'd definitely recommend staying at the trafalgar we had a great stay", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:33:29.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
