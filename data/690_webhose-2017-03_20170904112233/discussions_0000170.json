Old world Paris with a modern twist. This little boutique hotel is perfect. Rooms are new, bed was amazing. If I wasn't in Paris would have stayed in it all day, so comfortable. Bath was modern with full size tub/shower. Free internet. Mini bar, safe and breakfast can be ordered and delivered to your room. It gets better. One block from the Siene at Pont Neuf. Walk next door to the Louvre. 15 Mins to D'orsay. 10 to Nortre Dame. Use thier private airport pickup. Great staff and can book tours also....Great find!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:34:28.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
