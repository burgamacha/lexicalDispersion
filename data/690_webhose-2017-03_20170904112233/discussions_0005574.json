We were met by wonderful front desk staff who checked us in promptly. We got upgraded to an executive room but it was not yet ready. They actually gave us a room to shower and change in so we can go out exploring. I have not experienced this in a long time and I travel for business and stay at various properties. Concierge staff was super helpful. Free mini fridge was just an added touch along with Nespresso coffee maker and other goodies. Our room was on a 6th floor and pretty quiet. The room size is definitely bigger than most hotels in England and Europe. We had breakfast included with our stay which was absolutely wonderful. Aside from the buffet, we ordered freshly made omelets and other goodies (delish). On the day of my birthday, one of the waitresses treated us to Buck's Fizz (mimosas). What a way to start a day. However, all of this is not even the best part. The best part is it's location. Located in Covent Garden and just steps away from Trafalgar Sq., it is so wonderfully situated that if you're coming in for a vacation, this Hotel's location cannot be beat. There were lots of transportation options (two underground lines, city buses and hop on hop off stops). You can easily walk to all main attractions and most are within a 10-15 minute walk.
