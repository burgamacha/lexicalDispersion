It was a little tired in places (a tiny tile missing from the shower, chipped plate and mug), but overall was good value. The complimentary cocktail in the evening is a nice touch, and breakfast was fab!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:35:26.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
