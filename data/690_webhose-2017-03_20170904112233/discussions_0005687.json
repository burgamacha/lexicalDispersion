What a true gem! Great value for money! It's not a huge sprawling hotel, whilst it might not be a flash and fancy as others, do not let her old world charm put you off.\nFantastic location, request a higher room 10 floor upward, facing Empire State Building...it's an awesome view!\nBeds are comfy, bedding ok, plenty of towels. Only disappointment was that our room had no tea/coffee making facilities. This was not a major fail as there is a joint Subway & Dunkin Donuts concession literally over the road where you can buy.\nThe location is second too none! Down the road from Madison Sq Garden, 5min walk. Empire State, is literally the same along with the Flat Iron building and Times Square! For the price you can spend on hotels in NYC, be it for location, etc this hotel ticks my boxes for sure!! The money you save will be more for your amazing stay ‚ù§", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:05:03.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
