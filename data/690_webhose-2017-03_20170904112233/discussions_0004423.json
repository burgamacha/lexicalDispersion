It's not been a problem for us in winter time but it might be during other, warmer seasons. Also, during our stay we thought of relocating to the room at the top (attic) floor but exhaust chimney next to it was very noise so we decided against the move.\nRoom Tip: high but not last floor, backyard facing See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:33:38.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
