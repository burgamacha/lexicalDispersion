This is quite a basic hotel with small bedrooms and shower rooms, but it is clean and comfortable with friendly staff and in an amazing location. We were there to celebrate my 50th birthday and requested a room with a view, and were therefore given a room right up on the top floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower. I suspect that not many of the rooms share this view and I am very grateful that they made the effort for me - it certainly was an added bonus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:40:29.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
