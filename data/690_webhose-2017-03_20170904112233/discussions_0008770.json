They provided a continental breakfast and there were friendly reception staff who couldn't do enough for you. There's a cute coffee shop next door who does lovely sandwiches and an amazing pizza place a few doors down. The hotel isn't in the centre but it's about â‚¬10 to get there. Honestly you will be out all day so I'd recommend this hotel for any future travellers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:00:20.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
