The hotel very nearly got the full 5 stars but was let down by 2 main points. Point 1 The mini bar is horrendously expensive charging up to 10 dollars for a bottled water but this seems the norm for most hotels now. Point 2 my stay was interrupted constantly by one guests uncontrollable children, they kept ringing the doorbell (even in privacy mode this cant be turned off) and the parents had so little respect for other guests that they allowed there noisy children to ring the bell and also run up and down the hotel corridor and be extremely noisy in there room. My recommendation to the hotel is to put young family's with noisy rude children in another part of the hotel away from people who wish to relax. Other than this it was great and will defiantly stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:52:27.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
