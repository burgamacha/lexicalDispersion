Had issues w my Canadian credit card at c/i, but was my banks faults not FD. The agents and I had a good laugh about it and even when I switched payment 24 hours later and got back my$200 usd cash deposit they were very friendly about it as I was apologizing profusely as the typical Canadian. NYPD at front doors at all times which made me feel very safe and K9 unit w adorable GS dog which they let me pet each time I went by. All staff and NYC'ers very helpful as I was extremely scared about wandering around by myself in a huge city. The view of the financial district from my room was incredible, and the bed and huge shower were great to rest in after a day of sight seeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:53:38.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
