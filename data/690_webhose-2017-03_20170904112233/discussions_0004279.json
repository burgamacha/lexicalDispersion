I actually had two other hotels booked that I've stayed at before (The Knickerbocher, and the Hilton) but for some reason this hotel caught my eye and I ended up cancelling the others. I'm excited to be in town for a yearly work convention at the Javitz, but even more excited that I'll be celebrating my 30th birthday with some of my childhood friends that live in NY (I live in SF) as well! Killing two birds with one stone! My only concern is that I'm seeing several reviews about how small the rooms are, but had to stay within my companies budget. It looks like the cleanliness & friendly staff makes up for that! Didn't see much comments about the views, so am crossing my fingers ill get something nice! Looking forward to experiencing this new gem I found, and to celebrate my birthday in one of my favorite cities!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:21:51.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
