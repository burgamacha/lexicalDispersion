I've been inspired to do so, by Valerie and her associate Rina. As rare as me writing a review, equally rare are the kindness, expertise and a genuine care exhibited by Valerie and Rina in today's hotel and hospitality industry. In particular, Valerie went the extra mile to transform a routine, impersonal hotel visit into one befitting the occasion, and did so by asking questions and making adjustments, and following-up. She broke the mold by caring and acting when she did not need to do so, and just when I thought she might be the only one left to act in such fashion, along came Rina acting in full support. I rate this hotel full five star solely because there are true and caring people like Valerie and Rina helping guests, truly caring and working to make a difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:07:17.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
