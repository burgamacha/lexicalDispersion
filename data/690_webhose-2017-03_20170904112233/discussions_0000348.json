Envision a sanctuary of greenery, where you really can unwind and repose, in the centre of historical centre of Paris on St.Honore, next to the Place Vendome. That is MO Paris!\nUnderstated but refined, stylised but soothing, the interior decor by Sybille de Margerie underlies the modern tone of the hotel. And those fine details in common areas, eg. crystal papillons hanging from the gleaming ceiling, mother of pearl parquetry on floor... connect to the sense of femininity without being too effeminate. Rooms are all spacious, ample in natural lighting, and well-appointed. Without too much decorations to cast the grandeur of Napoleon or boudoir of Madame Pompadour, the interior is inspired by the contemporary Parisian taste, with all the modern comforts can hardly be found in other Grande Dames. What else awaits guests are indulging toiletries & appliances, functioning air-con (amazing!), great light control, and posh vanity area. This is truly where you feel assured, attended, familiar, just like home.\nThe service and housekeeping at MO Paris are immaculate, matching the signature MO standard. These young, well-trained staffers really care about their guests. And it was truly a surprise to be recognised by my usual server in MO Taipei when he delivered breakfast into my suite. He was back in Paris... How can you not fall for MO?\nThe concierge was capable and efficient. Reservation at Yamtcha? Reserved. Luggage forgotten? Taxi with your belongings just dispatched for CDG. Do you need other help, sir? I can't ask for more (and I am so grateful).\nFor those who seek tranquility and decency in vibrant city of light, for those who need a respite after a lengthy day of work or meetings, for those who would like to experience to true Parisian living, for discerning travellers looking forward the sense of domesticity in Paris, and for MO fans worldwide, MANDARIN ORIENTAL PARIS is the choice. There may not be the usual regal opulence greeting you when you step in MO Paris, but absolutely the joie de vivire to be felt in the air, in the smile of valets, in the garden, and in your room.\nSpecial thanks to those who kindly made my stay in MO Paris memorable: Sarah, Gillaume, the whole concierge team (particularly Patric), Woodstock who used to work in Bencottto of MO Taipei, and the whole management team.MOM\nRoom Tip: upgrade to a SUITE!!
