It is very well located: 15 min walk (in a 'slow pace') to the Arc de La Defense and about 10 min walk to the nearest tube/metro station (esplanade) that leads to the Classic Arc. However, my second stay was a bit disappointing: the front desk wasn't so nice, the room was not so big...They did what they could and changed my room twice. Not what I was expecting. Then I was informed that my previous stay was a 'two single beds' joint together rather than one double bed. In this last room, believe me or not, there was a slight smell of weed pairing in the air right at the room's entrance. I thought that was my impression so I didn't report, but the mystery stays....So, I recommend you go there and request a room with two single beds and ask them to put them together. That was probably the best room experience you can have....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:27:03.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
