Good hot water on demand. Great location.\nCons: A little older thus smaller bathrooms. (not a problem for us but for larger people may be an issue) Lower floor rooms facing the street will hear street noise. I asked for an interior room higher up and it was much better. They were accommodating based on availability.\nOverall good, we would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:37:14.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
