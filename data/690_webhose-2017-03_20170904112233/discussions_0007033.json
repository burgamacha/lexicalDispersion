The location, right around the corner from Place des Vosges, is perfect for exploring the Marais. It is also very close to the bus and metro. The hotel is surrounded by fabulous restaurants, cafes and shopping.\nThe staff make the hotel a true home away from home. The concierge was happy to suggest dinner spots and make restaurants. Everyone working at the hotel is friendly and happy.\nOur room had twin beds which was perfect for my daughter and I. Hotel rooms in Paris are small and our room was no exception. It was cozy but impeccably decorated and taken care of. Comfortable beds, beautiful linens, a clean and modern bathroom, top notch toiletries provided.\nFor the location and quality of the hotel I think it is a tremendous value for the Marais. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:43:36.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
