Staff is very respectful and courteous, with a special mention to trainee concierge Zoey Zeng, who helped us with our taxis and always provided us with a smile and pleasant conversation.\nRooms are adequate to the price range, although the light sistem can be a little bit confusing. Very comfortable beds, and TV with international channels for foreigners. Good size bath and rain shower. Overall clean.\nBreakfast has a high choice range, both western and Chinese, although some plates at display were empty. Our waitress Tina was very helpful and engaging.\nPool area is also quite charming, as it is located on the 6th floor and has excellent views of Beijing's skyline. Water is a little bit cold for this time of year, but the pool sofas are comfortable and cozy.\nThe only complaint we would have would be that the IRD lunch chart that we ordered was left in our room for one consecutive day, despite calling reception several times to remove it. No big deal, as reception staff were very helpful at all times and always tried their best.\nHat off to all the staff of the Hilton who provided us with great service, will recommend this property to friends who are planning a trip to Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:08:22.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
