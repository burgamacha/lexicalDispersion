From the moment we arrived we were greeted by Arya the front desk manager with a bouquet of flowers to celebrate our occasion. We were upgraded to an Ambassador Suite which was a pleasant surprise. Dinner at Cai Yi Xuan and Mio were superb, including the service. Special thanks to Sharon Wu, the Cai Yi Xuan manager, and to Silvia and Seven, from Mio restaurant. In addition, Jessica Zhang was very attentive during our stay. All in all, fantastic experience. Incredible breakfast! Cant say enough about attention to detail. Thanks Four Seasons Beijing for a memorable 3rd year anniversary!\nRoom Tip: Corner suites are worth the upgrade See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:12:59.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
