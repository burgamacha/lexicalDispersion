A bit tired but clean, shower good, fridge, hair dryer and toiletries provided. Plenty of towels. Air con not great but not a problem for us. Leak in the shower fixed straight away. Lift dated but okay. Building is traditional with character and not an ultra modern box.\nReasonable price booked through booking.com and we feel good value for money\nThe best part of our stay at the Hotel was Raphael on reception. He was pleasant, polite and helpful all times. He is a credit to the hotel as his customer service is excellent. A refreshing change!\nWe would book here again and would recommend it. It is old style and typically Italian but welcoming and comfortable, ideal for a stay in Rome and sight seeing. Good customer service and we felt safe here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:52:19.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
