Breakfast very tasty and good, rooms very nice, reception service very fast and effective. Everything is near from the hotel we've never had to take public transport or taxi just to go at the airport which is normal. I will come back with great pleasure and will recommend ! If you don't know were to sleep in Roma do not hesitate anymore :) I'm working in a hotel in Paris and have nothing to say at all !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:13:06.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
