From check in to check out the hotel out performed our expectations. Our room overlooked the Opera House, we opened the window and listened to the street performers play American Rock and Roll. The bar makes incredible drinks and the restaurant has great service and food. They made sure we had the right wine paired with our brunch. Thanks to the entire staff for making our one night incredible.\nRoom Tip: Ask for an Opera House view.
