We were a 5 minute walk from the colosseum, 15 minutes from vatican city, and everything else was also walking distance if you're willing to walk. the hotel is small, the rooms are too however that doesnt take away from its charm. the staff are super nice and very accommodating. Anything you need, just ask. The food however in this establishment, is unimpressive... at least what we had for breakfast and a taste of dinner. I'd say enjoy the breakfast since it's included but go elsewhere for the dinner. There are plenty of restaurants (touristy) around the hotel. we enjoyed its location and we loved how charming this little hotel was. its a gem!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:31:54.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
