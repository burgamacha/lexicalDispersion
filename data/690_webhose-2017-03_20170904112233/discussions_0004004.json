The surprise was how pleasant the hotel was, very well appointed public areas, the rooms spacious and comfortable for the centre of Rome. We were on a B&B basis and breakfast was acceptable, covered most choices, hot food, cereal and cold meats, toast and pastries. The staff could not have been friendlier and helpful, with advice and recommendations for places to visit and eat. We would come back to this hotel and have no reservations to recommend or a short break to Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:24:41.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
