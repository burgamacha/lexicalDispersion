There are tons of nice places near the hotel and you can go by foot to Westminster to enjoy London fully.\n-Breakfast is the best thing ever. Not only it's yummy it's also cheap. The best value to spend a great day in London!\n-The staff was super nice! Especially the night staff: Champagne, Marius, Bintou, Majid ( and the guy who helped us with the USB cable). I do not remember everybody's name (sorry) but the team made a fantastic job and we'll definitely come back thanks to them :D\n-Being able to take a bath after walking all the day was very appreciated.\n-There are lots of parcs and playground in the area. Very nice time for kids.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:38:18.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
