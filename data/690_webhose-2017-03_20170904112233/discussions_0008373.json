The location was very good and hotel was very easy to find from the Charing Cross station. Staffs allowed us to be registered first, store our luggage and use the washrooms to freshen up. We then got back at 2pm to pick up our room keys. The room was clean with sufficient amenities. Though as expected, the space is quite small. There are lots of cafes and restos nearby so no need to worry where to get the next meal. Big Ben, Parliament house, National Arts Gallery and the West end are all at walking distance. Just need to take note that there's no drop off point and parking space for guests. During our check out, there was a big crowd at the lobby and entrance which seem to be from a tour group. There was no holding room, thus making the lobby too crowded. Overall, hotel was good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:18:52.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
