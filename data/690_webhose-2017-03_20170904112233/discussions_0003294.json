We have over the years stayed in some Fabulous hotels ( Cape Grace SA. Savoy London,+++) none of them go that extra mile that 41 goes to. nothing was too much trouble, we required an ice bucket, 2 minutes later it arrived. needed a reservation for dinner- sorted . The car was looked after very well(Valet Parking)\nThe stay was for my Birthday and there was a cake waiting for us in the room and Birthday wishes from the staff.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough 6 stars would not be enough, we chose the Hotel because of the Trip Advisor reviews and it turned out to be a very good decision.\nA huge thank you to all the staff who made our stay probably the best stay that we have had in London, well done everyone, hope we can stay again sometime.\nRoom Tip: I am sure that all the rooms are wonderful See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:40:30.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
