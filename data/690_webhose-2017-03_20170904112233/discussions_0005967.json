As you can see from the photographs the hotel oozes charisma, the map shows its perfect location and the reviews speak volumes for the service.\nThe hotel were extremely welcoming; assisting with bookings and 'extras' - all of the staff we dealt with were beyond perfection with great big smiles too. The room was a tidy and functional space (if a little small- I paid for a premium room but clearly got the smallest of the lot) and has built-in universal plug sockets as well as a multi-faceted USB charger besides the bed - a lovely touch. Skip the mini-bar and head to Monop' supermarket, just a 2 minute walk South (sorry, Ekta!) for better choice and prices.\nI'd highly recommend Ekta to others as well as consider a return myself - it simply ticks all the boxes. Location, comfort, staff, price, style. Ekta is a solid 3 star hotel though how it only has 3 is staggering.... I guess the 4 or 5 provide a more pompous service rather than Ekta's welcoming, comforting, warm, classy, modern reception. Get yourself a reservation whilst its hot!!\nRoom Tip: The elevator is very slow; stay on a low floor if possible.
