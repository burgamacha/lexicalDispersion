Amazing attention to details, very helpful and friendly staff. Good location and as advised and expected very small rooms. We had a deluxe king empire view (room 2104), bathroom was really nice. While room is super well equipped with everything you needs. Very comfy bed as well. We turned off the air con as we couldn't get to grips with it and it kept coming on at odd times but no problem as we like the window open. It was my 50th and the bottle of wine and homemade cookies were a really thoughtful touch. Roof top bar was cool as well. One small consideration if you are a light sleeper is that the lift vibrates the room as we where next to it and while the spyglass bar was open you could hear chairs being dragged constantly as it was above us but no biggy.\nOn consideration it was very pricy for the size of the room. We usually go for a suite hotel i.e. The Benjamin or Kimberly and they where cheaper but the Archer does do it's very best to make up for the small room with small classy touches.
