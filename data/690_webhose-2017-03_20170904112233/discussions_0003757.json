Consistently high quality. Always clean. All staff are friendly. Mgr. visits you in the breakfast room to say good morning and to see if you need more coffee or anything else. Breads for breakfast come fresh each morning from the bakery next door. No prepackaged breakfast items. Scrambled eggs, ham, breads, other pastries, fresh orange juice, hard boiled eggs, and more. Unbelievable coffee. Room size is slightly larger than a 'typical' Parisian room. Electric window blinds cuts out light. Noise from street isn't an issue at all, quiet street. View of Eiffel Tower from your room for $25 more. Good water pressure in showers. Many good cafes nearby. Best booking rates via Facebook.
