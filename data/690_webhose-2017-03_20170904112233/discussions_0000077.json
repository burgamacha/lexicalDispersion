The room was very spacious for 2 pax and our luggages. We had the room with an eiffel tower view which was reallyyy nice at night.\nThe room has a king size bed, a small kitchen area, utensils and microwave. So if you guys wanna save money for shopping and cook in the apartment, this is one of the aparthotel that i will recommend.\nMacdonalds is just at the bottom of the apartment. And metro station is just a seconds walk. Really convenient. To travel to Eiffel, Louvre, PSG stadium, Champ Elsees is accessible too.\nThere's a 24 hours convenient store about 2 minutes walk from the apartment to get your groceries.\nHighly recommended especially for girls who think of their safety while in Paris. 24hours receptionist also available. And to enter the apartment, you will need an access card.\nA highly recommended accomodation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:24:40.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
