Wifi is free and not limited to 30 mins like other chains. This Premier Inn also has a bit of character, being housed in a former maternity hospital. All in all this is now our first choice when visiting London as a family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:15:39.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
