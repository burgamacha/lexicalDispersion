It is only a couple of blocks from Central Park and Times Square. It is on a good side of Broadway so no worries walking back late at night, plus grab a slice of pizza from 99C Pizza across the street if it's late.\nRoom:\nClean, Small, Comfy, just what you need. Bathroom was up to date and had nice finishes. Room was on the top floor and although you can open the windows toward Broadway, other that the occasional police siren, it is very quiet, even during rush hours.\nHotel:\nAll staff very nice and helpful with all questions. Bellman does offer free luggage storage for late departures.\nGreat hotel. Definitely recommend.\nRoom Tip: Higher Floors are very quiet.
