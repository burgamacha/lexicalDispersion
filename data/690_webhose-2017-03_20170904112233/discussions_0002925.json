Firstly, the staff are attentive and sincere, helping to ensure that you are taken care of and providing with everything you need before you even have to ask. The EVEN ethos permeates your experience and provides a much needed respite in the hustle and bustle of the city. You feel at ease as soon as you walk through the door and all the amenities help facilitate that sense of calm (the beds certainly help - haven't slept that well in months). The location is obviously amazing but it's really the staff and atmosphere that makes this experience unique. Not staying anywhere else when I go back to NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:40:02.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
