It was a perfect location for us, as we wanted to be near Brick Lane for a curry in the evening with our son, who works close by.\nCheck-in was very efficient and friendly and our room was very quiet, clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, our bed did creak noisily on every turn, but one of us took to the spare bed and we both managed a very good night's sleep.\n(By the way we are very slight - so it wasn't a weight problem!!).\nWe would definitely use this Premier Inn again. Close to Aldgate and Liverpool St stations, enabling us to go easily to the V&A Museum the next day. Also good bus services. We caught the bus straight from Soho - pop in to The French House on Dean Street for a drink, if you are that way - through to Aldgate. Costa coffee shop nearby if you do not want breakfast in the restaurant and a Sainsbury a few minutes away for bottles of water or snacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:26:57.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
