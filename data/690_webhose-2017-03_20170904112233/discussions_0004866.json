Apart from that, the hotel is centrally located. A street above its street where the hotel is located, is the famous shopping street, St Honore.\nThe whole experience made me booked this hotel the second time and will definitely patronize this hotel in the future. The front desk staff are cheery and very helpful!\nOne of the staff even introduced me to a local restaurant called L'adoise! It is located just beside the hotel and the quality of the food is amazing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:31:40.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
