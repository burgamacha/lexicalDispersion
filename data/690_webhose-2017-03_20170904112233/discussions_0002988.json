The lobby is just gorgeous, friendly staff. Room is small but stylish and modern. Obviously the location is right in the middle of Times Square, close to all the restaurants, bars, etc. this hotel has its character, vibe and the ambiance is just amazing. The rooftop bar has an excellent view of the skyscrapers. Definitely worth your money. Breakfast is ok too.. will be back surely.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:35:38.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
