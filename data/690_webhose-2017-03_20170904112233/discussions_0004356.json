They then took the initiative to research the best and most affordable ways to go about our sightseeing, leisure activities, routes on where to walk around the city, bus/train routes and restaurants They helped my husband to find places to play poker and helped me to find the best way walk to get to my course at L'ecole Vancleef & Arpel. Having them google search for us in French made our trip so much more relaxing because it was less headache for us because then we didn't need to think about if we were making the most affordable and logical choice. Wonderful Staff!!!\nThe rooms were clean and tidy, nothing out of the ordinary spectacular but cozy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:30:18.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
