The room is very small, if you traveling with many big luggages it's quite inconvenient, but there is plenty of room to store your clothing in their shelf.\nAmenities are great- they provide plates and cutlery.\nWe stayed here for 6 nights and both had good rest overall.\nWe loved this hotel and if we go to London again we would stay here with no doubt.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:12:53.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
