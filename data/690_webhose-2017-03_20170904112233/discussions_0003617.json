Fantastic location and the staff were great (esp Francesco) nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are a decent size, modern and well equipped, beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and all 'mod cons', including a kitchenette. Security was good as well. Only minus points were that the view from our room was the brick wall and windows of the offices opposite and the fact that the bathroom lacked a bath for a nice soak after a hard days walking around the capital city. Maybe a little pricey and there were no dining facilities on site, but plenty to hand just around the corner.\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Rooms above the entrance foyer are best for a view of Soho Square See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:12:57.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
