When we told her we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne - we'd already been upgraded to a superior room. The bedroom exceeded our expectations and offers great value for money for a London hotel. We had a quality kitchenette, huge super king bed and most of all complete quiet to sleep in. It's just round the corner from Earl's Court tube station in a lovely area of Kensington but still very easy to get into central London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:09:55.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
