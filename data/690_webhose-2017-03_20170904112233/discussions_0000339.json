The inside is every bit as lovely as the outside, with a stunning staircase leading upstairs.\nWe stayed for one night and wish we could have stayed longer. If you want a special experience you will remember, then look no further. The rooms are stunning, and a simple description here does not do it justice. You need to see them!!\nThe staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them.\nIf you have time, try out the Champagne Bar, the selection they have is amazing and the ambience is just gorgeous.\nBe advised though that they operate a smart casual dress code so don't turn up in shorts and t shirt and expect to be let in! But if you're going to a hotel like this then you should be dressed appropriately anyway!\nWe absolutely loved it there and will be back next time we're down in London. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay one of the best we've ever had!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:19:38.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
