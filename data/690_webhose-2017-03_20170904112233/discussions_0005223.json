The hotel's proximity to Gare de Lyon train station made it a must for weary Traveller. The hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially Sophie. She give us directions how to go to Castle Versailles without incurring expensive tours. The hotel has a welcoming lobby and good rooms. The lift was very small but it served its purpose. The best trait for me was the shower. Easy to operate and the hot water comes very fast. You don't need to find the correct temperature by adjusting 2 knobs. The breakfast for 12 euros was very basic but it's ok. Another great find was the Chinese restaurant up front of the hotel, it was great for us rice eaters from the Philippines. Look for our friend Luisa. Try their Coreander chicken. Another gem is the convenience store nearby and the Pharmacy. Great location for a hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:44:16.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
