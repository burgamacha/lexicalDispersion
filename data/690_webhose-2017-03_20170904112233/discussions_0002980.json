We very much liked this hotel. It's a very short walk from the Metro station. The staff are helpful.\nOur room, 604, and the public areas of the hotel are all very clean. You can hear the rumble of the Metro inside the room but we didn't find it loud enough to be a disturbance. The bathroom is very compact and you need to be able to swivel around the door to get to the toilet - I suggest you don't try this if many months pregnant!\nThe kitchen provision is very convenient and particularly helpful if you're on a tight budget as you can easily make breakfast there - there are good supermarkets just across the road to stock up. We had the paid for breakfasts, the highlight of which for us was the 'boil your own eggs' machine. So nice to be able to have freshly cooked eggs just the way you like them! Across the road are a wide variety of good restaurants.\nAdjacent to the hotel is a very interesting science museum. Get there before noon to avoid the queues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:27:21.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
