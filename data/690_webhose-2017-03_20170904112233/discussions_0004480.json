I'm partial to boutique hotels in Paris they are so well done and beautiful there! This amazing boutique hotel is located in the latin quarter of Paris france. The rooms are amazing and luxe with all the amenities you will need and lovely balconies! It's located near the Luxembourg gardens and convienient to all the sites like the lourve and d'Orsay museum (You can purchase your ticket at the hotel and skip the lines). The staff is so friendly and helpful not at all the stereotype of Parisians we as Americans have come to expect(and in some cases have experienced). I found them over the top in the helpful and friendly department. The rooms were really nice! I'm very picky about rooms and especially bathrooms but everything here was on point! We stayed in a deluxe room one night and a suite the next. Both rooms were well lit, super clean, beautifully decorated, and well equipped. Additionally the area near the hotel has cute shops and really good restaurants. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a cool Paris experience in a non touristy area! Special shout out to the front desk manager Valentin who went above and beyond to make our stay special! Staying at Hotel Baume definitely enhanced our trip! All in all they have great facilities and amazing service! @travelbarbienoire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:03:51.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
