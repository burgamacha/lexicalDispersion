We loved the contemporary style and quirky decor in the reception, bar and dining room. Our bedroom was great too, pure white walls, full height windows and spacious bathroom. The multi-coloured mood lighting was a novelty too. Could not fault the staff, very professional and friendly.\nThe icing on the cake is the position of this hotel, lots of London attractions are easily accessible on foot not to mention the wide selection of quality restaurants nearby.\nAll in all a great experience.\nA special thank you to Daniele who went that \"extra mile\" for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:19:54.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
