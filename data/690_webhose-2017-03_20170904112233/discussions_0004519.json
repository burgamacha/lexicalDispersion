The hotel is in a great location near the Cadet metro in what feels like a safe and tidy part of Paris. The staff were wonderful and suggested an itinerary for us to follow to see as much of Paris as possible in the short time we were there. Their suggestions were perfect and we had a great day exploring. We had just got engaged before arriving in Paris and the hotel staff left us a delightful note in our room with some chocolates; a really lovely, thoughtful treat. The room was perfect; comfortable, clean and with super d√©cor. We didn't have time for breakfast due to an early start but were offered breakfast to take with us, another helpful touch. We will definitely return to Les Plumes next time we are in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:10:19.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
