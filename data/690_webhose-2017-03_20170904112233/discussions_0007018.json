Maybe I just never had any special needs or requests until now. No, that's not true, I remember asking for an extra chocolate chip cookie at the Doubletree Times Square and was made to feel like a fool for having the audacity to even ask. Ever since then I have been skeptical of reviews bragging on any hotel. I stand corrected. The Splendid Etoile Hotel in Paris has made me a believer in superior service and going beyond the call of duty. This is very important when you don't speak French and need to arrange for shipping luggage to another destination so you can travel light, in our case, by bicycle across the country. Speaking of bikes, we had also arranged to rent bikes instead of bringing our own and the concierge at Splendid Etoile was more than happy to receive the bikes and store them for us until we arrived. The staff took a genuine interest in our plans and went out of their way to serve us, even negotiating on our behalf to save us money. The rooms are small but the location is excellent just a block from the Etoile Champs Elysees Metro station, and the Arc de Triomphe. Breakfast at 4 star hotels is usually way over priced for what you get, but in this case, I was very pleased, in fact, I would say it was the best spread we saw during our 3-week tour of France and Italy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:53:43.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
