The staff is incredibly warm and helpful, and the space itself is beautifully designed. The food is great, the bed is comfortable - I slept very well.\nIt's centrally located, but not in the mess of Times Square - just north, which makes it easier to get around.\nRecommended for anyone who wants a beautiful space for work or pleasure, and doesn't want to be in the middle of the noise of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:24:07.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
