Plus it was very close (2 blocks walking distance) to Penn Station. We were all pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The rooms were small but plenty of room for the weekend. Very clean rooms and hotel spotless. Free continental breakfast was a plus. Every employee we met were more than accommodating. We would defiantly use this hotel again. Also convenient to the subways to all Manhattan locations 1/2 block away at Greeley Square Station.\nRoom Tip: Top floors have the best view. Back of the hotel has views of the empire state building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:44:12.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
