Easy, quick, early check-in. Room was a great size for NYC and I enjoyed having a small kitchen for early coffee before breakfast. Room was exceptional clean and had a wood-grained tile floor and not questionable carpeting. Asked for a quiet room and was assigned one at the back of the building and although the room backed up to an elevator, I DID NOT hear it until we had a very windy day, and the wind could be heard in the elevator shaft a bit at night. Their breakfast buffet comes with the room ( and didn't cost an additional $25-35 as in some bigger name hotels in town) and was greatly appreciated. Nothing out of the ordinary, but decent, fresh, nourishing food with enough selection for anyone's taste. Also offered walk-away fruit to enjoy later in the morning along with cookies in the lobby in the afternoon. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this Homewood Suites for anyone that needs a home away from home while in New York City. Thanks Homewood Suites for a great stay!\nGreen Features: Like many hotels, they offer you a choice of changing bed and bath linens daily or on-demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:20:22.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
