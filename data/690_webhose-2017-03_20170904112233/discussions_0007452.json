The room was comfortable and well-equipped - tea and coffee making facilities, well-equipped bathroom. The bed was as comfortable as the adverts say! The food in the restaurant was first-class. Conveniently situated close to the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and the various amusements at County Hall. Also handy for river trips from Westminster pier. Would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have a good close-up view of the London Eye See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:27:09.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
