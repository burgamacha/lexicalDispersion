The twin room was very comfortable and an excellent size, especially considering its location in London. All the amenities of a good hotel room with well-considered extras including a mini-fridge. The hotel itself is very well looked-after by the maintenance and service staff so please give them my praise! A very nice breakfast included which was another credit to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again if looking to stay in the Paddington or Hyde Park area. Thanks for a pleasant stay.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors are likely to be quieter.
