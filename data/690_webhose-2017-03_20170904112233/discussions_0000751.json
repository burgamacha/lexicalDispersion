After a day of exploring Times Square, site and show seeing, we checked in at the Muse and were surprised to find how relaxed it was being so close to the hustle and bustle. We have stayed at Kimpton hotels before and are no strangers to the wine hour, but it never disappoints. Our room was amazing, spacious and with plenty of amenities, but that's true for all the Kimpton locations. What really stood out was the customer service, Daniel Mitchell the Concierge in particular. While we were checking in we had a 5 minute exchange and he was able to gauge our interests and recommended amazing places to visit. We took his advice and went to the Knickerbocker Rooftop bar and sipped delicious cocktails while taking in the beautiful skyline. We were really impressed with how personable Daniel was and how he was able to recommend a place we'd love after such a short interaction. It's rare to find someone in customer service who is gracious and sunny, but Daniel was both, he went above and beyond for us. We will definitely be back and recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. Be sure to ask for Daniel!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:07:19.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
