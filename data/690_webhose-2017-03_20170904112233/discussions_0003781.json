We wanted to see the hotel first.\nOn arrival the hotel is beautiful. Wonderful neighbour, beautiful entrance. The gentleman on the reception desk was very helpful and friendly.\nWe checked in to our Superior room and we're delighted with a lovely classic French decor.\nAs per all Parisian boutique hotels, the rooms are very small. Our Superior room, which was one up from the Classic room, was tiny. But very charming.\nLovely coffee and tea making facilities. They have a Nespresso machine, and supply ample coffee and tea. A fully stocked minibar is also available. They supply lovely bathrobes and slippers, and thhe bathroom toiletries are luxurious and well stocked.\nThe beds are comfy and they have a separate air-condition unit in each room. A definite plus in Paris in summer.\nThis hotel is in a nice quiet neighbourhood, with only a short walk to the river Seine and 30 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. There are ample restaurants and coffee shops in the area.\nLooking forward to staying here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:42:07.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
