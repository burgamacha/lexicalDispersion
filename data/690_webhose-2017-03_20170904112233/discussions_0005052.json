I was pleasantly surprised and I am now planning on staying here with my wife in the summer. The best thing about this hotel is that the service is flawless the staff are super friendly super helpful. The rooms are trendy clean and large by Paris standards. I stayed in the club room on the 4th floor.\nIt's just refreshing to get a seven star service when you don't expect it. Furthermore the location is just perfect you are at a walking distance from the museums Notre Damme and all the art galaries and antiques shops. A lot of great cafes and restaurants around you as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:42:59.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
