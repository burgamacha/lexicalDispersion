Rooms are clean and staff is really helpful and gentle. The room is fully-equipped with TV, refrigerator, dishwasher, small oventop, coffee machine, with complete set of plates, pans, glasses, utensils and so on. There's also a washing machine for 5€ and dryers for 2.50€ that are really useful for long stays. Some people here are complaining about the fact that there's no cleaning in the room for some stay (under 1 week i think), but hey, who really need to have someone make his bed, clean the shower or change the towels/sheets everyday? If you are looking for an high-class hotel to stay after your shopping at Dior, Chanel or Cartier, it's not your type of hotel, but if you want a good place for your money, with great staff, great services and all accommodations, this is the place to be. My only disappointment was the speed and stability of the wifi, but hey, i was in vacation after all. I will recommend this place to friends and colleagues for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:41:38.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
