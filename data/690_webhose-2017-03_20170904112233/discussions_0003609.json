We were in room 706 which has an inner courtyard balcony window with Eiffel tower view. It was also next to the lift, and it's announcements of arrivals at floors 6 - 8 could be heard in the room. A blocked toilet was fixed whilst we were out, and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The buffet breakfast had lots of options and was good quality with plenty of tables. It's not at the heart of the the museum district, and whilst \"Sacre Coeur\" might seem like a romantic alternative be aware this very much in Pigalle rather than the Montmartre hill from which it takes its name. It's not next to a sex shop or anything, but it's only a short stroll away. Anvers is the nearest metro, but if you find yourself at Pigalle it's not worth changing lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:45:40.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
