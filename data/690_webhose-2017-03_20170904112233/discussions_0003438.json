A shout out to Jennifer, Vivek, Joana, Jessie, Jelani, Edwardo, Tasha and Ramona! Your kindness and welcoming made the circumstances which brought me to N.Y easier to manage.\nThe room was very sheltered and quiet, which meant no view, but it had a vibe about it. I moved from another room on the 10th floor which had a joint room. NEVER do that! You feel as if they are there beside you. Location was fantastic, very clean room (I'm O.C.D about cleanliness, especially in a N.Y hotel...) and a lovely bathroom.\nThe restaurant that provided our breakfast was pleasant to sit in and I loved the coffee/tea Keurig machine.\nIt was a great combination of a comfortable bed, a quiet room and VERY helpful and lovely staff.\nIt wasn't a financial bargain, but you get what you pay for, especially for Manhattan.\nI would stay there again in a heart beat if I find a good deal for June/ July.\nRoom Tip: I stayed in room 1221, which had no view but it had a great cocooned feeling and a spacious layout.
