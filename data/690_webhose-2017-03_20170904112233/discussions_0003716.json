We had a nice view onto rue Boulard from Room 104. Street noise would have been a problem in the evening but the white noise from the air con fan made for restful sleep and the bed was comfortable. Staff were very kind (English was well-spoken and they were respectful when we tried our French!). Nicolas who checked us in was particularly delightful. Breakfast was a nice selection of pastries and meats and the attendant in the breakfast room was quite efficient and accommodating. There was a bar, but we did not partake. The room had a safe and and minibar. The bathtub made for a nice soak in the evening. While the room could have used some minor touch ups, its location made up for any imperfections. Several Metro stops are close by and it was super easy to get to and from Charles de Gaulle airport using the RER stop at Denfert Rochereau. One street south (rue Daguerre) is a pedestrian-only street with food vendors, patisseries (you MUST visit Thevenin at number 14), cafes and restaurants. There is a sweet park across the street from the hotel for a nice place to eat your crepe or just sit and enjoy being in this glorious city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:59:25.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
