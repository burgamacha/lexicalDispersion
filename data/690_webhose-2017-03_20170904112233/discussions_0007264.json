The location is ideal for St Pancreas , all be it if you have luggage I would advise getting on the 205 bus and travelling the couple of stops rather than walking uphill for just over a mile.\nThe staff were extremely helpful and nothing appeared to be any bother.\nNice room, with good facilities and comfortable beds. It was nice to have a proper bed for my little boy , rather than a sofa bed.\nWe ate from the bar menu in the evening as the main restaurant was a bit to intimate for my 6 year old and we didn't want to disrupt the couples who were having a romantic evening.\nThe menu choice was good and the food was tastey and well priced for London.\nI would use this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:30:45.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
