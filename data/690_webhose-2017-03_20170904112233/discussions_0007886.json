It was plenty of space for our family of 4 (kids ages 8 and 10). This hotel was absolutely perfect for our long weekend visit to New York though. You literally cant beat the location and the price point. We were literally able to walk everywhere from the hotel. We walked to MSG for a basketball game, Time Square, Central Park and dinner every night. We would definitely stay here again for future visits to NY and I would highly recommend it to anyone just looking for convenient, reasonably priced hotel in the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:46:22.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
