The area is fantastic for shopping and has a great nightlife with bustling side streets of typically French bistros. Hotel has a lovely non chain feel about it and although our room could have done with a lick of paint it just added to the charm. Our room was a good size with a comfortable bed and the staff were very friendly (special mention to the night porter Laurent who was super helpful, funny, and enthusiastic about Paris). Have already recommended it to family & friends and will definitely be returning!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:48:11.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
