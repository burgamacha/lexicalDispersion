It was our first time in newyork city , we don't have a booking because we cannot go to lad Vegas as most airlines are fully booked . One of the busiest American summer school holiday . We managed to get a flight to New York and come across the hotel reservations desk . The lady managed to get us a good discount do we tried. Ohhh boy , the room was posh . You can see the Tall buildings and Manhattan mall and Times Square with billboards . Walking distance to most tourist area like Times Square , were you can watch Broadway show and walked to the Empire State Building. We don't want to meet as anything so we hope in tourist bus.

We really enjoyed our stay but I must admitted that I had blown my whole savings and payed my cards with interest . But oooohboy .
