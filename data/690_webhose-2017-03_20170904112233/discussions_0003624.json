Quiet but still very central and within walking distance to many sights and lots of cafe/bars. I would recommend for couples looking for a romantic getaway without the hustle and bustle of some parts of the city. (I was rather worried on the drive from the airport lol)\nThe staff were very friendly and welcoming, couldn't fault them at all! We had paid for a superior room and I had forgotten to ask for a room at the front of the hotel when booking but because they were very busy and didn't have one they offered me \"a very nice room\" as the man on the desk described it.\nIt was just that! (Room 57) I expected small rooms as it was Paris but if I'm honest, yes the room is smaller than others I have stayed in but it was very well laid out and was actually really nice! The bathroom was really nice also and was bigger than I expected but the real wow factor was the terrace... If only we had more time to enjoy it but there is just so much to see and do in this city that you just don't get time to spend in your room!\nMy only down point was that the lift was out of order at some points during our stay and when you have trekked around Paris all day the last thing you want to do is walk up 5 flights of stairs. However this was a minor inconvenience and didn't bother us at all!\nI'm not one for leaving reviews but felt compelled to leave feedback as we had a wonderful stay and this will definitely be the hotel we choose when back in Paris!\nThanks for a great stay!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:47:01.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
