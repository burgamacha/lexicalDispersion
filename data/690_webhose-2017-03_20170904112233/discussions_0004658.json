Every interaction with the staff was so pleasant, whether it was a quick \"Bonjour\" with a smile when we came through the front door, or help with tasks such as printing boarding passes and arranging taxis. The room was beautiful; we had a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower when we popped our heads out of the window, and the quiet neighborhood and comfortable beds helped us sleep well after long days of walking around the city. The room was very comfortable for two, the bathroom was much larger than I expected for a room in such a big city, and the decor created a peaceful hideaway in such a busy city. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!\nRoom Tip: It pays to be an SPG member; we were upgraded to a room with a beautiful view!
