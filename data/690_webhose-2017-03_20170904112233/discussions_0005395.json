This ended up being a really good decision, I was thoroughly impressed!\nWhen I was living in NYC, The Standard was always a fun place to hang out, but over the years it has continued to step up its game. There are so many facets to the property - whether you're there for a conference, indoor/outdoor drinking/dining, late night revelry, or even to go ice skating!\nWe were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Liberty Suite. It was insane. Very unique design and incredible views. There are some great sitting areas and all of the bar accessories you'd need to entertain a small group of friends. The shower is really nice, and the best part is probably the giant freestanding tub right next to the floor-to-ceiling window in the bedroom.\nTo top it off, the staff and service were excellent. In particular, Regina and Samantha were super cool and helpful, and made us feel totally at home. Wish I never had to leave!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:06:49.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
