Nice toiletries, with a very pleasant aroma, very natural not over powering like some.\nWe spent the evening at the Phantom of the Opera Show and in the hotel bar 'Brumus Bar' enjoying cocktails and bar snacks. I can highly recommend the Raspberry Cheese Cake cocktail and the Haymarker Cosmo.\nAll the bar staff very pleasant and attentive.\nWe enjoyed a beautifully cooked breakfast in our room.\nHighly recommend, a very high class establishment with out the pretentiousness of some of London's other highly rated hotels. You just feel at home here.\nRoom Tip: Room 5 is beautiful See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:14:44.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
