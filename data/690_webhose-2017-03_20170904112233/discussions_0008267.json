The room was clean and modern, the beds were comfortable. The staff were helpful and were happy to provide extra tea and milk for the room. The shower cubicle was spacious and the shower was good. Breakfast was to a very good standard, the staff were friendly and efficient. This is a great location only five minutes walk from the Tower of London. Not many restaurants close by for dinner though.\nRoom Tip: Rooms at the rear of the hotel are away from the road.
