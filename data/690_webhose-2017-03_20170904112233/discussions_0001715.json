Front desk service is excellent. The room was not very large but it was well equipped. Courtyard is probably fine when on a strict budget but this one is nice when you are able to treat yourself a little.\nSome rooms have nice views. Lovely bar and dining room. In house starbucks so no bad in-room coffee issues.I don't understand the glass bathroom door and a room with 2 King beds option would be nice. btw: There are no other restaurants or shopping in walking distance. You have to pay for parking and internet but we got those fees waived because we are marriot members (free).\nRoom Tip: If you can afford it, pay the extra 20 dollars for a room with a view. It was worth it. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:27:31.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
