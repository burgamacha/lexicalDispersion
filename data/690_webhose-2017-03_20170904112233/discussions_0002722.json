Very conveniently located, it is only a 2 minute walk to the subway and then only a 10 minute subway ride into the centre of Manhattan.\nIt never took long to get where we wanted to be.\nThe hotel and rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable and the power shower was also great after a long day walking around! The room had a fridge which meant we could buy some things from the supermarket down the road, but there was no kettle in the room. You do, however, have access to hot water in the lobby 24 hours a day from the water machine.\nNo complaints about the staff at all, they were all very friendly and helpful.\nThe only reason I haven't gone for a 5 star rating is due to the breakfast. I knew the choice wouldn't be varied and that didn't bother me, and the breakfast staff were also very friendly. My problems were that one morning my husband and I found multiple black hairs on our bagels (my husband and I are both blonde), another morning there were hard bits of egg shell in my scrambled egg and another morning the sausages and egg were freezing cold. I tended to stick to the cereal and fruit after that.\nMaybe it was just my bad luck that week but this did put me off the breakfast.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this hotel for its convenience and cleanliness, and I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:46:15.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
