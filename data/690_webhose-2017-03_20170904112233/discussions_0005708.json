Upon arrival, we were led to a small crypt(?) which is I think part of the charm of the hotel. while waiting to be check-in, they served us tiramisu and prosecco. I loved tiramisu so, it was a good way to wait. They also gave us a map of rome and showed where the hotel is located and the other top spots to visit.\nWe were upgraded next door to their 2 room apartment! It was huge! We really didn't need that big of a space but We will gladly take it! It had a living room, a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and even a washing machine (this one I am not sure). Each room had an aircondition unit plus television sets. The cable channels are in the hundreds! Although a lot of it were showing just the same. My guess is with different languages only. We love the Etro toiletries that they generously provided.\nBreakfast is served at the main hotel next door. I think this is the typical Italian style breakfast. Valentina and Barbara were great and very friendly! They served one of the best pastries in my opinion in the city. Fresh fruit juices, coffee and prosciutto just makes breakfast so much better!\nThis is a good value for money hotel. And if you would like to explore the old roman area part of Rome, this is definitely the hotel to stay at.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:05.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
