My husband and I definitely looked worse for wear after being on a flight for 12hrs and in comfy summer attire, regardless the staff welcomed us with a warm smile.\nDane and Paul were usually at the door to great us in the mornings or evenings and they were fantastic! Always friendly and genuinely interested in what we had planned each day. Made us feel like family and not outsiders. Our room was superb and tastefully decorated. We had a king room facing the street and loved it. I love architecture and waking up every morning to the beautiful buildings of London was such a blessing. The end was very comfortable and we loved the lighting feature throughout which allowed us to control how much or how little we needed. Funny enough our only issue was that our room didn't get cold enough so we just opened our windows to enjoy the cool air. And yes coming from people who live in Los Angeles it might sound weird! They had turn down service every evening and our rooms were cleaned and beds made every day. The front desk was even helpful enough to lend us universal plugs and a power converter so I could use my hair straightener and curling iron. I have never come across another hotel offering a converter, such a plus!\nWhen I was researching hotels I really wanted a quintessential British hotel with a lot of history and charm. We hit the jackpot with this hotel as it had everything and more. Wish we could have stayed longer as we had the best stay. Front desk, porters, doormen and lounge staff were always helpful and greeting us by name. With 69 rooms I can't imagine that being easy!!\nThe Goring has exceeded our expectations on every level and we can't wait to come back in the near future. Thank you for a wonderful time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:55:49.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
