Check in was easy and additional options were given to us with regards to WiFi and upgrades. Ended up on the 45th floor with amazing views.\nDidn't really use the hotel facilities very much in terms of the restaurant as we were happy to go out and find somewhere different to eat for breakfast and dinner. Bar was very nice though and stopped a couple of times in the evening after our night out.\nNow for the really exceptional side to this hotel. My husband was unfortunately taken ill during the night and sadly had to spend the night in a hospital. The front desk staff called 911 for us and when I arrived back to the hotel having been told my husband would be staying in the hospital, I was very pleasantly surprised by the cards of get well and thoughts from the Hotel Manager and front desk security. Also later in the evening a tray of cheese & biscuits, fruit and drink was delivered to the room. I was extremely touched by the gesture and cannot thank them enough for this.\nAll in all I would recommend this hotel, the location was perfect and the staff second to none.\nRoom Tip: Choose a room away from the elevator as they can be quite noisy.
