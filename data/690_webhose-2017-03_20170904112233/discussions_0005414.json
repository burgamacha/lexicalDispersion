Literally everything is within easy reach. I chose the hotel very carefully for this reason for an eight night stay, in addition to the 5* rating and whatever your interest, from the theatres in Times Square, 5th Avenue etc for all the shopping, to all the galleries, Guggenheim,The Met, The Frick, MOMA, Carnegie Hall, all the landmark buildings...close by.\nFrom the moment of arrival to my departure, the staff were incredibly welcoming, cheerful and efficient, from the doormen, front desk, concierge, nothing was a problem and they went out of their of their way to make the stay as memorable as possible. My room was superb, sleek, very well considered design, extremely comfortable bed, with all amenities you would expect. The room size was not an issue at all, when you bear in mind just 'where' you are staying. I had the most incredible view right across Central Park from an upper level room, with floor to ceiling windows, it was mesmerising to just look out of the window at different times of day, you really feel you are in the heart of the city. I will certainly look forward to returning and staying at the Viceroy in the future and highly recommend this hotel.
