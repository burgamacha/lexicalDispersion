When you leave the hotel for the day, the receptionist holds on to your room key. I really appreciated this concept. Also, the people at the desk were welcoming, sweet, and helpful with any questions we had. Entry to the metro is right around the corner. Quiet street, comfy bed, great wifi. Quick walk to the best kabob's in Paris. Above all, we stayed on the top floor & could see Sacre Coeur cathedral from our window.\nRoom Tip: Top floor for best view See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:32:17.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
