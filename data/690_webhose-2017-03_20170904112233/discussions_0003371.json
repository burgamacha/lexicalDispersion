The day of my arrival I corresponded via text messages with an actual employee at the front desk about any preferences, etc., the doormen were extremely friendly and everyone made me feel very welcome! The hotel also smells wonderful! The building is beautiful and has been meticulously restored. The rooms and the bathrooms were very comfortable and clean and nicely done. The decor is fun and appropriate for the hotel and even the glasses in the room are not your standard boring hotel glasses. I could keep writing, but all I can say is that you should stay here!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:40:21.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
