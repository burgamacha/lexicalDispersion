I have recommended this charming boutique hotel to friends as I luv it. As you would expect the rooms are small, but clean and nicely decorated. The hotel has a lift. The location is fantastic and close to metro station Ecole Militaire. There are supermarkets and restaurants and cafe's on Rue Cler. The hotel is walking distance to Eiffel Tower. Mo is so helpful and passionate about this beautiful city. Mo booked us on a night time cruise down the Seine and gave us tips on where to sit to get the best views. Mo is extremely helpful with tips, tourist and travel information and speaks excellent English. Wi Fi is good. I can't comment on breakfast as we ate breakfast at cafe on Rue Cler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:31:22.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
