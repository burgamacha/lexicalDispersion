Our room was nice, of course on the smaller side as is pretty standard in NYC hotels, but the fridge and microwave was a great perk (only in certain rooms), and we had a nice view. The wifi worked very well throughout our stay. Also liked the complimentary daily breakfast.\nOnly suggestion would be to look into possibly adding a 2nd elevator, although the wait was not too long since the hotel didn't seem to be at capacity during our stay. But I think that would be helpful. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:13.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
