The staff immediate greet you & do anything they can to make your stay more enjoyable. The hotel lobby is lively with a lovely bar & open lounge boasting a gorgeous lit fire to enjoy coffee or afternoon tea.\nThe room itself was tiny!!! But everything else in the hotel makes up for it - plus, when visited London you don't tend to spend a lot of time in the room anyway.\nWould definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:56:10.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
