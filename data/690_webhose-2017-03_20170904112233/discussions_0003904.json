Amenities are adequate and well-maintained, and the location makes for a short stroll either to the many attractions of Theater District, or further up 5th Avenue to the endless delights of museums such as the Frick and the Met.\nThe Lanterns Keep bar is jammed most evenings with younger and very animated locals, but the Triomphe restaurant offers a smallish bar of its own, which is much better suited most times for a nightcap and some quiet conversation.\nDon't overlook the Library room, which offers good coffee, newspapers and comfy furniture for a nice start to the day, or as a respite between sorties out into Manhattan's many attractions. Computers are also on-hand, for us dinosaurs who still prefer to check e-mail that way, instead of poking at the tiny screen on a cell-phone all day and night.\nThe staff and front desk were unfailingly pleasant and helpful during our stay, and quickly sorted out a problem we were having with charging our phones.\nIn sum, the Iroquois offers solid value and a great location as a base-camp while taking in the many delights of New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:08:43.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
