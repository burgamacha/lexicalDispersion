Family and friends will all be at the The Roger. The hotel, the staff and all involved went out of their way to make our stay perfect. The room are spotless and the beds and linens are the highest quality. The sound insulation from street noise is excellent (hard to do in NYC). The atmosphere is pleasnat and calming. Location is perfect for walking and easy subway access. Everyone there did their bwst to accomadate whtever we needed.
