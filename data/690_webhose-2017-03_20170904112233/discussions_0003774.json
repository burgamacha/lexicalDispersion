The staff were all great. No problem dropping off/leaving the bags on the first and last days. There was a happy hour in the lobby which gave us time for a quick relax to plan our evening meal. Nice restaurants nearby. It is certainly not a 4 or 5 star hotel but we spent most of our time visiting the city so it was exactly what we wanted. That said there is an outdoor area with nice chairs for the spring/summer. Breakfast was included for us, there were eggs and sausages too and kept it us going throughout the day. We stayed in a triple room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:27:55.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
