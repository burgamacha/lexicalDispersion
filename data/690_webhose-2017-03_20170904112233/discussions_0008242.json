We stayed for one night in mid-February for an early flight out of Heathrow and chose this hotel as it is on the Piccadilly Line. I love both the interior and exterior of the hotel. The room was compact but well-designed. Water was provided and staff left some small cookies for us. I must send my compliment to Andres at the front desk who checked us in. He was extremely nice and recognized my Marriott status. I will definitely stay here again when in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:16:14.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
