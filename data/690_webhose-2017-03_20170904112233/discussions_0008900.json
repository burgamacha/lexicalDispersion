Even accommodated a very early check after arriving at LCY early in the morning. This hotel has a very young, fresh, modern and relaxed feel about it. If this is the future of hotels, I like it. the polar opposite of a stuffy hotel.Friendly staff, immaculate rooms, modern facilities, very funky! Also, best sleep I've had in months. Right next to a DLR stop & 10 minutes walk from LCY. Great job guys, well done. Not only would I have no hesitation in going back, I'd positively seek it out. I see some reviews mentioning a request for photo ID, I was asked for it (partner wasn't), Not a problem, we were flying so prepared with that anyway.\nGreen Features: I noticed that if you hung a notice saying you didn't need your room cleaning or fresh towels, you can earn credit to spend in the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:32:06.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
