The rooms are small and compact as it clearly states on there website; however for us this was only a place to sleep as we were busy all day and out for dinner every night. If you are tall ask for a room with larger bed - this is complementary on request. Hotel is really clean, modern and comfortable.\nGreat location 2 minute walk from Columbus Circle subway station. Walking distance to central park & times square etc.\nWe booked through secret escapes and got a very good deal - maybe I wouldn't of been so happy if I had spent more.\nRoom Tip: If you're tall you can request rooms with larger size beds See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:00:27.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
