We didn't want to be right in Times Square, but not too far away to walk. So glad we picked this spot. Rooms were comfy and clean. Staff was amazing. All the ladies at the front desk were so kind and helpful! Just really nice personalities. The bellmen were super nice and very quick! Never had to wait too long even though the hotel was sold out. I will definitely stay there again. I would totally recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:59:13.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
