Modern efficient hotel. Nice room - eight floor upgraded to Deluxe plus. For plus you get a Nespresso machine with four pods and a half bottle of red wine.\nDownsides- terrible smell of drains in the bathroom, surprising given how new the hotel is but not uncommon in London hotels. Free newspaper did not turn up. Room service menu provided by Jamie's Italian - ok but a bit limited.\nOverall good for a weekend break near the sights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:00:49.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
