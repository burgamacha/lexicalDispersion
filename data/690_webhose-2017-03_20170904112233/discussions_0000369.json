If you're large, like a lot of space, bring a ton of luggage or have that American sense of sizing, you might not like this property.\nAll that aside, this is a perfect little boutique hotel in the middle of it all in Paris. The staff graciously checked me in a few hours early as I was looking haggard after a delayed transatlantic flight. They were able to communicate perfectly in English (my French from my school days is stored in some dusty, unused part of my brain.)\nThe location is great. You're steps from the RER so you can get to and from CDG with ease. The Louvre and Pompidou Centre are a quick walk and all the sites are easily accessible via foot or public transportation.\nThe design is gorgeous. Trendy with a Parisian flair, the designers get 5-stars as well.\nWould I stay here again? No doubt about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:19:43.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
