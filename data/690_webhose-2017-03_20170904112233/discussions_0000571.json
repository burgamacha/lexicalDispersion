There are several reasons why I keep on coming back-\n1) Location, location. A skip and a jump away from Eiffel Tower, what could be more charming and better? On line 8 of Metro - Ecole Militaire, which is an easy connection to 99% of places to see in Paris.\nNext to Rue Cler, a charming locals street with tons of restaurant, shops, fromagerie.\nNext block (short block) is a Carrefour (supermarket), bank, post office. Across is a pharmacy, boulanger. Super convenient!\nThe neighborhood is safe, although I've noticed a couple of homeless people on main street -\n2) The staff - the front desk super helpful and spoke perfect english. Always willing and available to help out.\n3) Clean rooms, basic amenities, great breakfast!\nThe junior suite (Room 104) is great! One big bed, one small and super spacious. Great for family of 3 or 4, although there was only me and my friend. Room 305 overlooks Rue Cler - another pretty one, Room 302, overlooks Rue Motte Picquet - both rooms are as charming as the hotel.\nThere are nice hotels on 7th District and all over Paris but Hotell Motte Picquet is my go to hotel. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:31:19.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
