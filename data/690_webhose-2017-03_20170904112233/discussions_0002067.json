We were booked into the Trevi Hotel for a three night stay - breakfast included. The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. The room we stayed in was clean, comfortable and serviced by a modern bathroom. There were no tea/coffee making facilities but we take our own so this wasn't an issue and there was a mini fridge to keep milk. We really enjoyed our stay here as we are walkers and the hotel is within walking distance to all the major sites. However, the breakfast room is on the top floor of the hotel and the lift stops on the floor below, so if you have mobility issues this could be a problem - as you will have to walk up a narrow steep winding staircase. The breakfast room is small by comparison to the number of rooms/guests and it was very crowded every morning, particularly in the servery anteroom. That said, the breakfast was lovely - plenty of fruit, cold meats, cereals, variety of breads and pastries and hot food if you wanted it. We ate at some lovely local restaurants - the food was delicious. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Trevi and definitely would return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:38:56.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
