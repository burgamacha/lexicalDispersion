This hotel is more attention to detail, very hands on and like to go to know their clientele.\nThe room was grand, and I also got a free upgrade upon arrival which made the stay even better.\nThe location is perfect, 5 minute walk from the Colosseum. It's on a very quiet street and I think Is the perfect place for a romantic city break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:43.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
