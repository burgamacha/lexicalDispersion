It was a medium sized room with comfortable queen bed and soft linens, adequate storage space and in-room safe, walk-in shower with rainhead and handheld nozzles, plus heated towel rack. The toilet is in a separate room across the living space from the shower and sink room, though. The wifi was free and pretty reliable.\nThe hotel is in a VERY quiet section of the 7th, within three blocks of the Tour Maubourg metro stop and an easy walk to Rue Cler and the Eiffel Tower. Most of the staff was helpful and kind, too. I would definitely stay here again!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:17.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
