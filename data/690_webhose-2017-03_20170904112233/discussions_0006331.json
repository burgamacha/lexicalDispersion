So this time, since I needed this location, I chose a full suite and got a junior suite for my kids. Mine was lovely with a good-sized bath, comfy king bed, big closet, and a very nice chaise. The heat from the radiators was iffy but otherwise the room was quite nice. The junior suite was much smaller, tiny bathroom but very comfortable. The package we bought included gift certificates to Eli's down the street so I could even say that one of our breakfasts was included.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:54:15.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
