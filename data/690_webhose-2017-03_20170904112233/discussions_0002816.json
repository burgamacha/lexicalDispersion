This is one of the landmark hotels in Montparnasse and you can see this hotel from Eiffel tower as well :). Do not forget to witness spectacular views of Eiffel tower from the end of the street where this hotel is located. I have searched lot of hotels near to Paris attractions and still walk able from railway station. Super markets and restaurants are just few meters away. Best part is the location and you can take either bus or train to visit the Paris attractions. Be prepared to have long walk if you wish to catch trains as it is a major junction with lot of underground train routes. The hotel staff are very friendly. The rooms are kept very clean. We had memorable experience in this hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Request for rooms in top floors where you can get good views of Paris attractions See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:05:03.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
