Was a bit dubious to be sharing a room with my mother in law, but when we arrived, we got a 1 bed room with a seperate living space which had the third bed in! Perfect!\nBathroom was lovely, the shower was amazing! After a long day of walking around, we were so excited to get home to a super hot power shower before bed!\nOur room had a little balcony too, we didn't have any views from it, but was lovely to have the doors open onto it for fresh air and feel the ambience of where we were!\nLocation is exactly where you need to be! Termini is 2 mins away, trevi fountain is 15 mins away, colesseum 20 mins away, Vatican about an hour away but can be walked to by passing other lovely sites!\nThe room also had a fridge which was fab, we bought a 12 pack of water so we had a bottle each for each day we were here and the fridge kept them cool! The breakfast, which was included, was also lovely! Cheese, ham, bread, cereal, yogurt, pastries, fruit, coffee and juice...plenty to keep you full until dinner!\nAll in all, it's the only hotel I will be staying at when I come back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:31:33.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
