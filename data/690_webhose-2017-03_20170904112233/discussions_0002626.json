Some of the furniture is showing its age, and there were not enough functional outlets in the room, but those were minor flaws. Hotel pool on the penthouse level had an incredible view, water was warm and relaxing, making for a nice end to a long day of walking through the city. Location is fantastic, a short walk to both Times Square and Central Park. Lots of great eats a block away on 9th Ave. Metro stop is a convenient two block walk. Staff was friendly and helpful. Wifi is free in the lobby, but a $2.95 charge per night per device in the room. Otherwise, very few complaints about this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:18:58.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
