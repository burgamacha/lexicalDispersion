We could see the Spanish Steps as soon as we stepped out. The Barberini square was not far and had a great choice of restaurants and was very close to the metro station. The hotel rooms were very spacious and a great view. The only downfall is the air conditioning did not work so we had to sleep with our windows open which on some nights was loud! Additional to this the breakfast was quite poor. We actually skipped it on the last day and went out to eat instead. Most of the staff were friendly, but some came across as arrogant (the lady who checked us in on the first day) and the hotel was clean. I would recommend that you stay here based on location and cleanliness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:30:23.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
