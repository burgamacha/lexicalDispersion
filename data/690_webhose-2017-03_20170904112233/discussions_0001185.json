And it was perfect for what we needed.\nThe hotel and its grounds are exceptionally lovely and well maintained. While its located right on the shores of Lake Victoria, the rough dirt road on which the located makes it feel like you've going to the wrong place. But rest assured, despite the dirt road in, the hotel is exceptionally modern and well maintained.\nThe pool and its surrounding areas are open and beautiful and the pool itself was an exceptionally nice place to hang out. We had dinner at the bar, which I liked, and the drinks/service were very good.\nOur room was of good size, with a nice balcony. Not much of a view, but having the open space was an asset. The bathroom is nice with good water pressure and very nice towels.\nThe staff was professional, friendly and available...all things that one would want in a hotel.\nOverall, the hotel was very nice, albeit a little generic without a lot of personality. This was not a hotel I would \"seek out\", but if my travels took me back to Kampala or Entebbe, I would be happy to stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:20:47.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
