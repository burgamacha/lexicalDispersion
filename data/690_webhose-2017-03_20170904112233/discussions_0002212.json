Best thing about hotel is location - extremely close to the eiffel tower and to metro stations that took us everywhere we needed to go. Takes just over an hour via public transport to get here from CDG airport.\nRooms were spotlessly clean, bedroom isn't massive but we didn't mind. Large bathroom with great shower.\nOnly downside would be the noise that came from both the street (we stayed in a room on rue saint-charles) and there was music played from the street until late into the late. Also, the hotel walls are extremely thin -you can hear everything that comes from the neighbouring rooms.\nHowever, overall I would recommend a stay in this hotel for a short visit to Paris\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room not on rue saint-charles See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:42:25.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
