What an enjoyable stay we had-this is an all inclusive hotel ( which for whatever reason we hadn't picked up) but having sone so had a most enjoyable stay. Depending upon your fellow guests dinner is rather like being at a dinner party at someone's house. It is nicely small so you do get a chance to chat to other guests without neccessarily having to have dinner with them. Dinner is probably the only time the staff look under strain as because of the above most people sit down for dinner at the same time. However this is a small point and doesn't distract from how good this hotel is.\nPerfectly positioned for walks along the cliffs the really special thing about this hotel is the staff who can't do enough for you-all staff had the same \"can do\" attitude.\nThe bedrooms are all super and quirky (we had to split our nights between rooms 2 and 9) My only small grouse is that the rooms rather than curtains have plantation shutters which allow quite a lot of light in early in the morning!\nHaving said all that a cracking hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:17:55.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
