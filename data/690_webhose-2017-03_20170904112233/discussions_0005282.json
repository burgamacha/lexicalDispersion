They are the same as seen in pictures\n- Rooms were very quiet. Didnt hear any noise from other rooms or outside (we stayed in room 203)\n- Bathroom is big. Shower had good water pressure.\n- Bed was comfortable\n- Good location with 2 subway stations within 5-10 mins walk. Close to walk to Brooklyn bridge, downtown and lower east side\n- Lots of good restaurants close by in China town\n- Staff were great! Very helpful and cheery\n- Cold / hot water is provided in basement which was good\nThe bad\n- nothing. Highly recommended and I would definitely stay here again\nRoom Tip: Stayed on second floor (room 203) which was a corner room and it was very quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:31:49.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
