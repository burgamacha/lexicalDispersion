My son and I took a last minute trip to NYC. We booked a 2 queen room at the Knickerbocker. The location was a 15 minute walk from penn station right down 7th Avenue. We were walking distance to so many stores and restaurants. We were initially given a wrong room type and were immediately upgraded when I questioned it. They even gave me a complimentary drink at the Rooftop bar. The hotel is brand new very clean with super friendly staff. Rooms have automatic room darkening shades. The bathroom was very large with everything you could need. All of the lights were on automatic dimmer switches. They even provided a notepad in the room with free wifi! We had a nice stay and I will definitely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:11.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
