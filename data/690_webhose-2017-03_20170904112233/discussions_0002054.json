You see, one of the upside/downside of this place is that they offer dormitory rooms, either female or mixed. A man in front of me was shocked, SHOCKED, that it was a shared room and left without checking in. I asked the lady at the desk if this was common and she said yes, often guests tried to explain that there was an error.\nThe upside is that you can bunk in NYC in a clean warm/cool place for around $60/night, the downside is that when I returned to my room at pseudo 4AM (Spring forward) after a show in Brooklyn a young lady was asleep in my allotted bed, which had my bag, some presents and my C-PAP set up under it. She was apologetic and moved fairly quickly, but if something like that would weird you out it might not be for you. Each bed has a towel, the bathroom was clean and had a shower with dispensers for soap and shampoo.\nThe downside, maybe, is that the room I was in, the \"Abbot and Costello Room\", had 7 small single/cot beds in it, ~30\" wide. I'm 6' and was able to be comfortable in it. Also, this room does not look like the dorms pictured, as the windows were small and started not 2' off the floor, but rather 4.5', making the room rather dark. There was a large dorm fridge and a smallish flat panel TV as well.\nThe neighborhood is gentrifying and felt safe and well occupied even in the wee small hours of the morning. The J & Z, B & D, and 4 & 6 trains (subway) are a short walk away, so all the City is close. Lots of bars and restaurants in the area with Little Italy and Chinatown short walks away.\nAll that having been said, if you want a place to crash in NYC on the cheap and you're not too squeamish this could be a good value. The room was full the night I was there and the 4 people I had a chance to meet were quite nice, even the one who didn't belong in my bed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:05:56.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
