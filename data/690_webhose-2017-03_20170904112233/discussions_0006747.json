Beautiful d√©cor, great atmosphere, and the rooms were clean, well appointed, and high quality. The value for money was very reasonable, and the overall property was situated very close to the Park, and also Times Square. A good starting point if you like to walk and explore.\nThe service was very good, the little \"breakfast\" vouchers were a nice touch, and I recommend this place to anyone I know going to the City. As with other reviewers, the only issue can be wait times at the elevators, so if at all possible - try to stagger the timing of your trips earlier than most (or later than most). It would be frustrating waiting for the small elevators if you were in a hurry to leave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:26:06.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
