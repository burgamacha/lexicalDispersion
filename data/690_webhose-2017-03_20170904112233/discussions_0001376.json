It is only about at 10 minute walk in the opposite direction to the metro station.\nWe only had breakfast during our stay which is very basic but was enough to put you on ! I think the breakfast is the norm for Beijing hotels, just don't expect too much.\nThe room was basic but adequate and kept very clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful.\nThe hotel is a good base for getting around for the tourist areas l would certainly stay there again if we returned to Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:03:26.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
