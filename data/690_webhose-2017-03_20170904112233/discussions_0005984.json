Expectations are high when you book a room with at any hilton hotel. This one exceeded our expectations. Our king, delux room was huge, with its own walk in closet area that kept the luggage out of the living space. The bedroom was large and spacious with a sitting and work area. The bathroom was also large. The room was very clean. The hotel was conveniently located. 40-50min by taxi from the airport (no traffic). 20min walk from the Forbidden City & Tiananemn Square. 10min walk to the subway. Rght next door is a large mall with very familiar, Western clothing stores & restaurants. Down the little alley is an authentic restaurant, popular among the locals, in which we had an amazing Peking Duck dinner. We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:08:31.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
