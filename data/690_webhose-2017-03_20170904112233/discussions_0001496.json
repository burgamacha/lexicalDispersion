We had a small room but it was adequate. Everything very clean. The dining area is quite small so you may have to wait for a table at breakfast, but the lady who looks after the dining room is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is both hot and cold. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a value for money stay in Rome. The location is ideal in my view.\nRoom Tip: Quieter rooms at the rear.
