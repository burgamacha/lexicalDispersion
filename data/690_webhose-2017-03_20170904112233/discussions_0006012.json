The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable and nothing is too much trouble. We got to Paris early morning and although we couldn't book into our rooms until early afternoon they were able to store and lock our luggage away while we went sightseeing. Croissants and coffee was given before we left and tips on the best place to find things. Very close to the metro and moulin rouge it's perfectly situated. Breakfast and soft drinks included in the price and even the bed was comfy. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone it's a little gem!
