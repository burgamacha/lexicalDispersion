The hospitality is fantastic and you are made to feel so comfortable and accommodated for. The service itself is exquisite and all staff members are so friendly and helpful. The location itself was great and we could walk to everywhere we wanted to get to. The room was beautiful and we would have happily just stayed in the room all weekend. We had the buffet breakfast one morning which had so much choice and was delicious, it set us up perfectly for the day. Would not hesitate to book again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:24:22.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
