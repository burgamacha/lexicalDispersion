The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly and the room was very well equipped with a really comfortable bed. The room was small but we expected this being in Manhattan, but it was extremely comfortable. The sound proofing to the outside was fantastic as we could not hear any noise at all from the surrounding busy roads, but the internal walls are sadly not so well proofed and we were very aware of the noise guests in the neighbouring room made at 5am one day. Overall a brilliant find and I'm sure we'll return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:18.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
