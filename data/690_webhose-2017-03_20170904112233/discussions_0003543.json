First impression its showing its age and it is clean and strategically situated near major shopping mall, grocery, convenience stores, restaurants and the Paris Metro. Novotel Paris La DÃ©fense is a great hotel with a good restaurant for breakfast and it is located in Paris' major business district (very good for business travellers). The accommodation that I got is good with a view of the neighbouring building/apartments. Bathroom is well-appointed and for the first time i stayed in a hotel the bath and the toiled is separate (very unusual for me). i had a pleasant time in this hotel and definitely will recommend to family and friends. See you again! Paris!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:16:51.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
