The room is super clean and very well maintained. Everything was upgraded and convenient. I love the location and it just close to everything I needed.\nI want to give a special shoutout to Moni, who was such a delight. Never have I seen an employee gone above and beyond to ensure their hotel guests receives the best customer service. She was so fun to talk to and full of joy. I saw her being able to be professional and more than help during difficult guests and rush hour. I would definitely come here again when I come back to New York again this summer.\nThis hotel and its services feels just like a 5-star hotel with 5-star customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:38:54.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
