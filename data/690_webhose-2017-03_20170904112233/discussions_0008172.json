The service was superb, and although it's not in the city center it's a short walk to the Metro Marconi. Our time here was for our week honeymoon in Rome. This place would be just as ideal for business men, solo travelers, or any couples traveling who like a little Italian style at a great value. Families could stay here as well although be aware there were not extra activities like a pool to keep them occupied beyond maybe tv and wifi [but then again you are in Rome why stay in your room or on wifi]. There is a hot tub on the roof open when weather is permitting.\nWe\nMy room with a balcony that opened to the street was quiet only with the glass door shut, but this wasn't an issue for me.\nThings to remember:\nThe Rome city tax is charged at the end of your stay. Save some euros for this.\nThere is a nearby Car\nPros:\nEager to help, professional, and pleasant staff.\nComplimentary Smartphone use during your stay with free wifi, calls, and convenient gps.\nClean, modern, and decent sized rooms [tv/ toiletries/ wifi/ ironing board and extra towels on request]\nBuffet breakfast package was plentiful and a good variety, definitely worth it.\nChic Italian style at a great value.\nSmall Carrefour within walking distance for reasonably priced necessities.\nPossible Cons: [If we are being picky I'd say these are the cons]\nNot as many options for dinning in the neighborhood as in city center [but hey the metro is right there so not a deal breaker]\nAsk for a higher room if you prefer a quiet area want to open your window away from street noise. This wasn't an deal breaker for me.\nProstitutes roam the streets at night, although they aren't threatening in the least again this wasn't an deal breaker for me. However, maybe not the best atmosphere for some families.\nYou might not be a dog person like me, be aware there is a hotel pet that lounges around. He minds his own business.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a higher room if you prefer quiet away from street noise.
