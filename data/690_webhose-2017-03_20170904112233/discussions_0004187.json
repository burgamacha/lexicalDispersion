On this trip like our previous one, the attention to detail is what makes staying here so enjoyable. From Marta G., who was the front desk person, (She remembered us from our previous visit) to the bellman who asked for the proper pronunciation of our name, and then made sure to address us by our name. The attention to detail by the housekeeping staff, who not only turn the bed for you, but make sure that the blinds are drawn and night slippers are set by your bed.\nThe linens are soft and comfortable, the beds are restful and the toiletries are what one would expect in a luxury hotel. We even purchased one of their bathrobes!\nWhat makes the Hotel Chandler so special are the people, who are friendly and welcoming. The spaces in the lobby to sit and connect with friends and the \"home-like\" ambiance in the midst of a bustling city. The hotel is quiet, comfortable, has all the amenities one would expect and is a gracious and relaxing space in which to visit New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:27:14.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
