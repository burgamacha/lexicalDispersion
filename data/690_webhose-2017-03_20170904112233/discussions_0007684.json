The hotel seems period from the outside but within the inside design and technology along with luxury are well detailed!\nThe room we stayed in had a huge modern bathroom an area with a sofa for TV and then as in a U shape you would enter to the sleeping area. It was so nicely appointed!\nThe restaurant was really good and you could access the hotel from two streets. You can also walk to nearby restaurants and tourist areas without having to use the underground.\nI loved this hotel and the service could not have been more exceptional.\nThere is a small lounge with refreshments, TV and a free buffet breakfast and all day snacks if you have some loyalty privileges. It was great to use and offered a great part to enjoy London!\nRoom Tip: Try the rooms in the adjoining tower, they are bigger rooms and have a different entry.
