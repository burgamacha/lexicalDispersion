When we came to check in way early, Massimo hooked us up with the huge apartment they own next door! It was vacant so we spent the first night there, then moved into our very cute room the next 2 nights. The entire staff couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. The breakfasts were simply awesome. Whether it was the buffet or to order, Barbara's team in the kitchen put out a beautiful spread. Francesco makes a superb martini in the evening, by the way. Also, thanks so much to the bellman Valerio, who was so friendly and helpful, always with a warm smile. The location of the Inn is ideal, just minutes from the Forum and Colosseum, with great restaurants if you head the other way into Monti. It was a bit of a splurge for us but worth every Euro. We loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:09.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
