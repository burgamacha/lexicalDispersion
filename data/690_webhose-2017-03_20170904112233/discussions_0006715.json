To me that's everything. Every employee we encountered was friendly, helpful, engaging, and courteous.\nProperty is well-located for points throughout Lower Manhattan and especially of course the ever interesting and ever improving Lower East Side. It also has very convenient access to Brooklyn and NJ. The nearby subway is your gateway to all boroughs.\nProperty is well-maintained. It's not pretentious, its purposeful. Things work in room, in fitness center, on lobby computers. Things are stocked. You can tell.\nHousekeeper showed real interest in helping us. Restaurant server engaged us. Maintenance people were cheerful. Front desk people always inquired of us when they were available as we passed. Happened to meet the GM. He sets the tone.\nNote: separate independent secure reasonable parking lot across the street is a huge benefit for travelers arriving by car. In years to come, check in advance as to the availability of that service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:17:13.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
