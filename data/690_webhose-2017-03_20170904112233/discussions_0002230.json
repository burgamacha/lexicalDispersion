The rooms are on the smaller size, but very clean with nice furnishings. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, with smooth check-in and check-out. There is a basic but perfectly serviceable breakfast. The Latin Quarter is a 5 minute walk away, and we also walked all around the 5th, 6th, and 4th. We would definitely recommend this place for couples on short Paris breaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:41:15.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
