If you book here check if construction has resumed as being on the east side of the hotel would be noisy.\nThe rooms are small which will give visitors to NYC an idea of what most apartments in NYC are like! Having said that the rooms have good facilities including TV, refrigerator, complimentary Wi-Fi.\nStrangly the bathroom and hallway had linoleum floors with fake wood pattern, and our room at least had a bathroom shower door that didn't close resulting in wet floor and wrinkled flooring. The staff are friends and helpful. During our four day stay there was a blizzard that resulted one evening with the lobby being full of attractive airline cabin crew waiting to check in!\nRoom Tip: West side would be away from construction site next door See more room tips Green Features: towels are encouraged to be reused however they don't dry in the bathrooms which remain cool", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:55:52.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
