We booked a deluxe double and had a large seating area in a very well appointed room. The room seemed brand new and it felt like there might have been some refurbishment recently.\nGreat weekend. Great value versus other London hotels. Good location.\nMy only minor issue- when we came back after dinner (around midnight) the bar was all set up for breakfast the following day meaning there was nowhere to sit & enjoy a night cap. The two couple in the bar were marooned on the last two non-breakfast tables! We took out drinks back to our room. Definitely something to change - get a few sofas maybe!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:17:22.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
