Going in, I was unsure what the small rooms would be like. But they are beautifully appointed with mostly stunning views. The online booking process was easy, and the rate was shockingly reasonable. When I go to New York, I'm rarely in my room, so I didn't miss having more space. Furthermore, there are really nice common areas and two different bars. I was in town for business, and I had meetings in a couple different locations. The staff was also super friendly, and they even upgraded me for one night. The only negative I could give it is that some of the artwork, in particular at the top of each elevator, feels a little homemade and doesn't quite go with the hotel. But overall this place is a winner.\nRoom Tip: Great views on upper floors See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:59:44.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
