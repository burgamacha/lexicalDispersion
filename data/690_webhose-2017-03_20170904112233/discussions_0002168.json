Spent an anniversary here in January and The Smyth did not fall short. The reservationist, the bellmen and the front desk attendants were warm, friendly and accommodating. Our room was spacious and even in the dead of winter the balcony offered too pretty a view to pass up. We were treated as if we were the only guests in the hotel and it seemed as though it was everyone's first priority to make our weekend one to remember. They turned a little weekend getaway into (what I hope will be) a new tradition and what definitely was a trip to remember. Thank you!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:03:06.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
