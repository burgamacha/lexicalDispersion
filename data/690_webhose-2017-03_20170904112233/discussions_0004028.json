Yet despite some teething problems -- staffing levels etc -- I would highly recommend this hotel. Great vibe, lovely and warm staff whose professionalism was truly tested during Snowstorm Stella when I was there. During the storm, most guests were confined to the hotel and the staff went out of their way to make sure everybody was comfortable and well-looked after. The emphasis on \"wellness' is lovely and the rooms are truly superb, clean, well-designed and incredibly comfortable coming complete with a yoga and a mini-workout station. They are still hiring which meant the staff was understandably overwhelmed at times (such as one person working as a server during breakfast which slowed things down) but the management assured me they were on to it. In addition, I would ask, given their international clientele being so close to the UN, that they have a better range of international TV news channels. No BBC World, France 24 etc. Anyway, special shout-out to manager Robyn, and Caroline from the front desk who literally walked nearly a block to find me a cab on a hectic Thursday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:16:40.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
