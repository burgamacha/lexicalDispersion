So amazing. After reading the reviews and then experiencing Hotel La Tamise for ourselves, no words can describe how exquisite and far better the experience was. The room was absolutely stunning and perfect size. We arrived at about 5:30 in the morning and even though our room was expectedly not ready yet, the extremely accommodating and friendly staff provided us with a huge breakfast much needed after a 10 hour flight from Africa! Not only was the staff extremely professional and friendly but they were tentative and were a huge help when we needed assistance with getting around and choosing places to eat. There recommendations were nothing short of amazing. They payed attention to the little luxuries and details which we really appreciated. For example, they even prepared a little bag full of pastries and fruit for our trip back to the airport after our stay. Thank you to ALL the wonderful staff at Hotel La Tamise. We cannot wait to go back!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:33:33.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
