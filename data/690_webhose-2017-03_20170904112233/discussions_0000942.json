Hotel is great with VERY comfortable big rooms, shower is Amazing . the shower drain was slow the first day, we called housekeeping, and the next day it was fixed. Breakfast was wonderful with made to order eggs and pancakes and had many choices, dinner at the buffet was good as well and we eat there twice.\nLocation of the hotel was great , you can get a taxi just in front of the hotel. I would 2nd another reviewer on the room temperature, the weather was freezing outside but the room temperature was very hot and we couldn't get the air conditioning to work, looked as if temperature was centrally controlled by the hotel.\nAll in all it was VERY happy with my stay at the New World Beijing Hotel and it is highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:26:21.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
