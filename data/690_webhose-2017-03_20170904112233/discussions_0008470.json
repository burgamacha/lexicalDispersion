This is especially true in NYC, with so many different options for hotels and such a variety in cost and quality. Most hotels I've stayed in in NYC have tiny rooms, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find the rooms here were large, with a decent sized bathroom, too. There was a coffee machine in the room which also made tea (essential for a Brit!), as well as a fridge and the usual things - safe, ironing board, iron, toiletries, hairdryer - and some other useful features such as lots of USB charging ports. There was even enough room for a desk and a comfy chair, with a foot rest. Staff were generally very friendly, however we were disappointed with the service from the \"market\" shop inside the hotel. We would stay here again though - clean, comfortable, good sized rooms, fantastic location and reasonable price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:47:17.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
