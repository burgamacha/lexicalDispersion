Despite reviews saying that the street noise was awful, we actually slept with the window (actually more like a door!) open all night and weren't really disturbed. We didn't bring this up with the hotel staff as it wasn't really a problem.\nOther tiny negatives were that we only got one small bottle of water in the room, for two guests, and the cups were paper.. They came with lids which is great if you want to take them out, but less useful if you want to make more than one cup whilst in the room.\nBreakfast was plentiful and fresh - Its served buffet style, and there was a choice of coffee machines (more standard or a lovely Nespresso).\nOverall I'd definitely stay here again, it was excellent value.\nGreen Features: Very good, notices in the room and towels/bedding not changed unnecessarily.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:34:02.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
