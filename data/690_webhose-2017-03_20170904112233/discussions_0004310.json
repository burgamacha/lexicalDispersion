WE chose it because we were going to the theatre near Montmartre and wanted a hotel within waliking distance. The hotel has been refurbished and, most important of all, the room size was very comfortable. In paris there are so many hotel in which the rooms are tiny and therefore uncomfortable. We had a large double bed, and a big bathroom. The cupboard was spacious enough for us.\nWe ate breakfast at the hotel and there was a well furnished buffet. The staff was very helpful. We paid 170 euros plus &รง euros per person for the breakfast. In our eyes it was very good value for money.\nIf you want to eat at an excellent restaurant in the area, go to La Cerisaie at 70 Boulevard Edgar Quinet. It is les than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. It serves south-west France cuisine and is delicious. It is a very small restaurant and so you have to book a table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:19:14.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
