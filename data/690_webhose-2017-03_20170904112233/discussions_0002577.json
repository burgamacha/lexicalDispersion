Very helpful and it felt like I was staying at a B&B. The staff went above and beyond to help me with packages I had for an event at UNESCO. The room was a good size and very clean. The only issue I had was that there was hardly any legroom to use the toilet, so I had to sit on it sideways just to get business done. Apart from that, it was all modern inside, very comfortable, and I'd be happy to stay here again just based on the staff alone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:39:36.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
