It is a very short walk away but far enough that you're away from the crowds.\nThe room was a decent size for a Manhattan hotel. There was a mini-fridge, safe and microwave. It had a desk and chair. There was no closet, no dresser and only drawer to put anything in. No iron, hair dryer, and suitcase stand. There's only 2 hooks to hang up anything on.\nThe room and hotel were very clean. Checkin was a breeze. It's a small hotel. But it does have a business centre to print boarding passes, etc. and a modest sized exercise room. It also has a little bar with a friendly waiter.\nThe decor is modern. Hallways have carpet but the rooms are hardwood.\nThey have breakfast but it is pricey. There a Dunkin Donuts a block or two away. They have a modest room service menu as well but I didn't try it. There is a small store with a good selection of snacks and drinks, including beer, for sale in the lobby.\nI didn't have any trouble with noise at all. Staff were all friendly and helpful.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:17:26.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
