Minutes away from The Louvre and approx. 20 minutes walk from Norte Dame. The staff are warm, friendly and have a good knowledge of the local area and therefore able to point you in the direction of restaurants etc. The only negative for us was that our room was small and we would have found it difficult to have room service had we wished it. We would have also liked tea and coffee making facilities. Despite that we enjoyed our stay and would stay at the hotel again.\nRoom Tip: Tea and coffee making facilities in the room please.
