What we didn't count on was the 56th floor room we had and the brilliant view of Manhattan - very special!\nThe room was spacious, well decked out and very comfortable for our nine night stay. Hotel restaurant facilities are fairly basic but there is so much to choose from close by that this is not an issue. No issues with service though you'd expect some greetings during an extended stay.. That said .. the price point is much cheaper than a Grand Hyatt or Park Hyatt so you can't expect the same service..\nGreat location, comfortable hotel and very good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:18:24.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
