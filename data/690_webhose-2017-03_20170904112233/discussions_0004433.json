The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was there for my birthday weekend and found a sweet note from the staff in my room! The location was PERFECT only five minutes from the Louvre and the train to the airport. They let us leave our luggage before check in which was a plus since the Louvre stopped allowing it. The decor was fun. The room was smallish but met all our needs. The bathroom was awesome - spacious and updated. However, we were on the 6th floor and the elevator broke while we were there. Yep. 6th floor. It sucked. We opted not to get the breakfast but I must say - they should have offered us free coffee for the inconvenience. The honesty bar costs 3 euros for a tiny cup of coffee so like I said - something for the inconvenience would have been nice. Otherwise it was a great experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:33:17.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
