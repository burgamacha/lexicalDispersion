I don't use the word \"perfect\" lightly -- it's that amazing. I want to stay places that are beautiful, convenient, and that leave me with a good feeling. This place was a 10 in all categories. They held my invitations for me, and even helped me get an early check in (with a bit of good luck). I can't imagine staying anywhere else.
