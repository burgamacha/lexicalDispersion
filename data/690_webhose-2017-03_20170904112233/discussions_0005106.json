Stayed for 2 nights with no problems. Rooms are on the small side, but clean. Full private bathroom in each room. There was a breakfast option to purchase, but we skipped that, since there are plenty of places nearby to get coffee and pastries in the morning. The Eiffel Tower is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. They contract with a car service to the airport, which was useful (cost is 18-20â‚¬ per person).\nWe would stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:48:33.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
