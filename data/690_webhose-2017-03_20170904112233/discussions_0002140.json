Gabrielle Mariano, a Westin Experience Specialist, contacted me before my trip to ask if there was anything she could do to make my stay more enjoyable. Well, let me tel you; she delivered in spades. My wife and I were treated to a fantastic high floor King suite and greeted with a bottle of wine and a cheese and fruit plate. When my sister and her husband checked in, they were upgraded to an executive corner King with amazing City and Hudson River views.\nAside from the fantastic hospitality, we could not have asked for a better location. We went to see Alan Doyle & the Beautiful Gypsies at the famous BB Kings on 42nd Street and we did not really even need to go outside as it is literally attached to the Westin. It was a cold weekend in NYC, so the proximity came in handy. The next night we went to the new Broadway musical smash, Come From Away. The theatre was located a short walk away on 45th Street.\nFor the foodies, Hell's Kitchen on 9th Avenue is a five minute walk away where there are literally hundreds of restaurants serving international cuisine. For the sports enthusiast, Madison Square Gardens is only about a dozen blocks away.\nThanks to Gabrielle and the team, it is hard to beat the Westin as your home base when visiting the New York on business or pleasure.
