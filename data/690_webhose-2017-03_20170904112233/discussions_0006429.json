This hotel hasn't been upgraded so still the older purple decor but still in good condition. Staff friendly and helpful. Only negative was the quality of the TV in the room was poor however we weren't in the room much so didn't affect us.\nWould stay again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:34:01.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
