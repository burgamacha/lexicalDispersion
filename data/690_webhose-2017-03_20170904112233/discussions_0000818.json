The rooms may be samll for some but suited our needs the only small critisism that I would have is that there were no faciliies in teh room to make your own tea or coffee but that is minor.\nThe breakfast is very good and the happy hour in the bar amazing, 3 Euros for a beer with free snacks is all anyone could ask. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:06.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
