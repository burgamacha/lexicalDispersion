This hotel should franchise their approach as it rivals many 5 star hotels including roof terrace, informal restaurant with very reasonably priced drinks and food, free still and sparkling water in the room fridge every day, sauna, really spacious rooms (we stayed in room 220 on 2nd floor), smart TV, great WiFi throughout, vending machines offering everything from prosecco to toothpaste and a breakfast to set you up for a day sightseeing in the Eternal city. We would recommend this hotel to people of any age. It is central, extremely modern, comfortable and quiet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:45:07.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
