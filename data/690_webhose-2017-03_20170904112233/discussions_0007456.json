That said, the hotel was lovely! Clean, chic, comfy and priced perfect for the value. Wifi advertised and it worked! Bathroom was exceptionally small, but clean with hot water and pressure perfect. Toiletries provided and good quality. First I've seen of this, but in order for lights/power to stay on in the room the room key card must stay inserted in a slot next to light switch. Interesting power conserving measure. Great location between Bayswater and Paddington close to Underground tube, pubs, and shopping.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:08:25.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
