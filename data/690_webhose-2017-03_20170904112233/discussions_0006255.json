Originally, my stay at this hotel was scheduled for 3 days, but I decided to extended it for 2 more days. I stayed in 2 different rooms and felt that the rooms were nicely decorated and I also enjoyed the different portraits featured in each room. Each member of the staff that I interacted with was very pleasant as well as helpful.
