It is positioned in an ideal location for visiting the city and an easy walk to the Colosseum and the hop on hop off bus stops. The staff where helpful and welcoming, we were given lots of information about the city, places to visit and they were able to book tours, which we did of the Colosseum and the Vatican. The room was spacious and well layed out. The sound proofing was good and we were not disturbed by other guests. My one criticism, I have to drink de-caffeinated coffee and asked for this in the restaurant for breakfast. This was provided, but Nescafe instant, which was rather a disappointment. Please have de-caf ground coffee available for those of us that need it. Great hotel, wonderful city, would certainly recommend.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:53:33.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
