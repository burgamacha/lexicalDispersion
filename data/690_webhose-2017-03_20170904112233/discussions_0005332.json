The location is perfect for sightseeing/business/dining, which is why we are there. The rooms are a fair size, even for NY hotels and the bathrooms are full size which is also nice for NY. There is no grand lobby, which we like, giving the hotel a boutique feel. There is a 'library' that always has coffee/tea for guests to grab and go. The staff is extremely accommodating. We look forward to staying there again.\nRoom Tip: It's small enough that every room is a decent one.
