They also arranged a car transfer to the airport in the morning for me.\nThat was a big deal because I had to get picked up at 4 AM...\nThis resort is located in the heart of the historical district close to the Trevi fountain and many more things within walking distance....\nMany wonderful restaurants and shops nearby. The room we had was on the minus one level. It was the last room they had but we were definitely not disappointed. Even had a kitchenette and a refrigerator! It felt like our own apartment... very private\nI would highly recommend this for anyone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:37:43.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
