Centrally located with most attractions within 15 minute walking distance. Upon a late evening arrival we got checked in very quickly and were welcomed with a fruit basket in our room. We had breakfast in the breakfast room every morning and were greeted by Pasquale with a smile and he got our cappuccino orders in right away. He also made sure our daughter had a baby seat each day. We organized a trip to Vatican City through the hotel and the front desk was so helpful. They answered our questions, gave us great restaurant ideas and truly made things easy with logistics. Last but not least, our daughter became ill while on the trip and we had to have a doctor come the hotel. We called the front desk and they had a doctor there in 25 minutes. What a relief it was to have someone there so quickly and to know that the hotel had someone they work with frequently. We missed breakfast that morning so the hotel sent up some breakfast and cappuccinos for us on the house. I couldn't believe the service and kindness we were shown. I can't say enough things about the staff and service at Hotel Artemide. You won't regret your decision to stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:28:12.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
