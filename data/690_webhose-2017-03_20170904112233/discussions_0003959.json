He advised he had been able to upgrade us to a king room which we were very pleased about but were not expecting how amazing our room and perks would actually be.\nOur room was on the 18th floor but the lifts are quick. We didn't get great views from this floor because Lexington Ave is quite a built up place but the room more than made up for it.\nNot only had we been upgraded to have a king bed, but we had a bottle of champagne and bottle of red, the most amazing looking fruit bowl, popcorn and sweets. There were two bathrooms in our room and a walk in wardrobe which made our stay even more comfortable.\nWe had a coffee machine and fridge in our room which was great as there is free water bottles in reception so it meant we could keep our drinks cold.\nAs an extra special touch, we had been given 4 drinks vouchers that we were able to use at the bar in the lobby, all 4 totalled $100 so we made good use of those!\nAll in all, the hotel is a great choice if you want somewhere accessible for sightseeing without the craziness of Times Square.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:28:58.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
