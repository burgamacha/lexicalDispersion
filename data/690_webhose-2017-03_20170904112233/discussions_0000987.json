We found the Hotel to be well located 1/2 block to the subway 10 - 15 min walk to Manhattan Mall and right in the flower district. We got caught in the recent snow storm (Stella) and had to extend our stay a extra night. The staff we extremely friendly, helpful and professional during this time even though they were also stuck at the Hotel and had to work overtime. Our room was clean and modern with a large flat screen TV, Mini fridge and microwave, with plenty of room to move around. The Hotel was quiet (we were on the 18th floor) and the elevators were quick and not crowded even though the hotel was full. I would also like to give a thanks to Chris at the front desk for the extra service he gave.\nRoom Tip: We found the 18 th floor to be quite for Manhattan.
