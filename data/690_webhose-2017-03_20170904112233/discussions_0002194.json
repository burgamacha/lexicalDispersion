Nice touch that the coffee is freshly made when you arrive at breakfast and is good coffee. Staff very efficient if a little short staffed at breakfast, a lot to do for the two ladies running it. Generally I liked the hotel, only down side no bar for when you return from town but the mini bar in the room is very good value .\nHarry's bar is literally 1 minute up the road, but avoid cafe veneto just down the road from Harry's bar .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:57:27.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
