Bruno at the reception desk was friendly and helpful and we checked in very quickly. The hotel is very colourful and spacious and our room had everything we could ask for. Wonderful King sized bed, a fridge, safe, powerful walk in shower, a desk, seating area and tea and coffee making facilities. We are both vegan and were delighted to find the hotel had an abundant supply of soya milk. One of the girls at breakfast time made sure our supply was plentiful. It really means a great deal to us and her friendliness, and work ethic ensured we had a great start to the day. Breakfast was fantastic with so many choices, I felt I had to thank the Chef and staff for being so attentive and personable . The hotel is linked to The Excel and DLR is only a minute away to ensure good transport links to the City. We were both very sorry to leave and think it was the best hotel we have stayed in. Thank you so much to each and every one of you for making our stay so memorable. We will definitely come back to The Aloft!!\nRoom Tip: All rooms are good but I imagine the higher up you are, the better the view.
