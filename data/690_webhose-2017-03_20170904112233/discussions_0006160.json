My room is tiny with en suite lavatory and basin the shower is next door and is shared. I didn't realyse this until after I booked and was a bit apprehensive.\nI arrived on a very early flight and enquired about early check in. They were not amenable and I booked an extra night.\nFrom my arrival the staff were lovely. I was on the 3rd floor and there is no lift but I'm relatively young and strong!\nThe shared bathroom is fine and the rooms are spotless.\nI ate at Le Bistro des Dames last night and it was good.\nThe position suited me well and it's a lovely walk down to many of the sites. The hotel is clean and pleasant but please don't expect George V - you certainly aren't paying for it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:09:07.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
