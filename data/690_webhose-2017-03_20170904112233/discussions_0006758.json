Overall, it is a comfortable and friendly place. This time, in mid-winter, the bed quilt was extremely thin and cold for the weather. It was impossible to switch up the heating system in the room, as it seemed to be on an automatic eco system. That is a good cause, but I prefer to be warm in the winter. We ordered Room Service breakfast one day to save time. Only toast and porridge. The porridge was cold and only just edible. The toast was stone cold and must have been made a good half hour before the coffee. I also noticed some Room Service being brought up in the Guest Lift, which means the staff had to queue up with the food trolley, taking a long time. I assume there is a Service Lift somewhere. The staff are very helpful and polite. When my wife complained about the cold food, the Reception staff immediately apologised and confirmed she would cancel the charge. As a HH Member, it was not made clear to us whether we could use the Members' breakfast room or HH Floor Generally, it is a welcoming hotel and good value for money", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:31:48.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
