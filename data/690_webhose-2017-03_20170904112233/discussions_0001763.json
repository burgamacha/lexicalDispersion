This did not disappoint. The staff did their best to have us in a room early, despite us arriving way before \"check-in\" time (which we were super grateful for as we were jet lagged and in need of a nap before exploring). Our views of the Eiffel tower, especially at night, were stunning and the accommodations generous space did not go unnoticed. The hotel lobby's coffee was delicious, and it's location in vicinity to shopping, dining and above all, the metro, truly made this a memorable and enjoyable vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:24:50.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
