Quiet, which is always good. Wonderful view from the 22nd floor patio (no furniture out there in winter but a great view of the Empire State Building). Right near the High Line and a short walk to Times Square, Bryant Park and many good tourist spot. My only gripe was that there was no cell service in my room--a quirk but very annoying. I had to go to the lobby to make or receive calls. The desk couldn't help other than offer for me to move to another room, at my inconvenience and no offer of any compensation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:24:32.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
