This property is new, having just opened in October 2016. We were not disappointed with any aspect of this hotel. From check-in to check-out the staff was very polite, friendly and helpful. It was great that they arranged a ride for us back to LGA, one less thing for us to worry about.\nYes, the rooms and bathroom are small, but very nice. The beds were comfortable, and the room is nicely decorated.\nWe paid extra for a \"city view\" and it didn't disappoint!\nThe free breakfast has a nice selection and was good. Breakfast staff was friendly and helpful, too.\nIts only a short walk to Columbus Circle, Central Park, and Carnegie Hall, and even the Ambassador Theater (where Chicago is showing) and Times Square are only a 15 to 20 minute walk.\nI would recommend this hotel to everyone.\nRoom Tip: be sure to spend a little more for a city view, or you won't see much at all See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:45:55.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
