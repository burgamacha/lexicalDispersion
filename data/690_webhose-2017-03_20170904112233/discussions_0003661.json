There is a supermarket just a stones throw away and on the corner not far from the hotel is a very pleasant bar.\nOur room (603) was very comfortable and a good size. It has a balcony and good views of the Seine.\nThere was plenty of choice for breakfast.\nThe staff are lovely, very pleasant, and nothing was too much trouble to them.\nWe will stay here when we visit Paris at any time in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:26:58.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
