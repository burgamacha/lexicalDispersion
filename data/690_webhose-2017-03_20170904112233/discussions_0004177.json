The hotel is situated in a perfect location at Columbus Circle: just across from Central Park, near Lincoln Center, and not far from Times Square. The service was excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very spacious, beautiful, comfortable, and clean. Can't say enough good things about this hotel and our experience there.
