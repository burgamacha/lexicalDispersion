We were not disappointed. We booked a deluxe room, with views over the city. The location of this hotel is perfect. Walking distance to Forbidden City, Hutongs, Beijing Mall, Shopping Centres, Supermarkets, Tea shops, subway etc all on your doorstep. Rooms are a little dated, but very clean, quiet, and a fabulous king size bed. We highly recommend this Hotel if visiting Beijing.\nRoom Tip: Deluxe Room, 9th Floor, large, sunny, overlooking the City See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:00:53.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
