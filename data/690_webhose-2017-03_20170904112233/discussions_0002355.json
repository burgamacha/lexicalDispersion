The room is lovely and has everything that you need for a short stay including mini fridge and safe. Lovely bathroom. Only thing was our air conditioning didn't work but luckily it wasn't too warm so not a massive problem. All of the staff were lovely and very helpful. Particularly the receptionist who was always there to give us any advice that we needed about the city. The breakfast is also very good. They offer cooked breakfast along with a selection of breads etc and lots of lovely jams! Although we had very wet weather, we enjoyed our stay greatly. Thanks again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:34:25.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
