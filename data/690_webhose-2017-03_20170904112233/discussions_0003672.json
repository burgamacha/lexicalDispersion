Staff are very friendly and accommodating. The hotel was decorated beautifully and was super clean. The cleaning staff always did a phenomenal job each day cleaning up the room and providing fresh sheets/ towels when needed. The hotel is on a side street so it was nice and quiet. Very close to the metro and has some excellent restaurants and bakeries in the area. The complimentary breakfast was perfect! All of the servers of the breakfast were very friendly and pleasant! Will definitely stay at this hotel again! Thank you for a wonderful and comfortable stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:05:37.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
