The lobby was beautifully decorated. The rooms were small but nice. Everything was very clean and well kept. The elevators were very slow, there were three operating at all times, but it was a busy place. Breakfast was very nice and actually very spacious I thought. There is NO parking aside from valet which was VERY expensive, $65.00 per 24 hours for my SUV. We really had no other option, but it worked out ok as we rode the subway to most all of our destinations. The hotel is also within walking distance to Times Square which was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:56:20.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
