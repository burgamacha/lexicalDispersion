This was my first ever afternoon tea and I'm afraid of going to any others as it won't ever be as good. The food was so fresh and tasted amazing, champagne was top notch, variety of teas was more then I could have hoped for and have to say my favourite was the Willy Wonka tea but try as many as you can. Nothing was ever a trouble for the staff, we had some allergies to work with and they were ever so accommodating and changed what we had to fit our needs. Getting a golden envelope that you can't open at the end is actually killing me but great gimmick to get people to go back as you can get free things but only if unopened on your next visit.\nIf you get the chance or aren't sure about where to go then hit this place up you won't be dissapointed and will never want to go anywhere else.\nThank you", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:04:27.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
