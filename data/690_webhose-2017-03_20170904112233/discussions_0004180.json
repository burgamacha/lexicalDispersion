The girls at the front desk couldnt be better, oh there were two guys too. The room was extremely clean, very modern whuch is my taste, excellent bed and pillows not like some that are way too big. Room alittle small but this is manhattan. Fridge, micro desk and safe well done. The breakfast had everything you need but fresher than most ive seen. Must say i believe alot has to do with crystal the mgr. Who has a great personality Must also mention jeffrey who takes care of the breakfast room who is a delite to speak to. My ratings was working on this site so 5 stars for service and sleep qualirt. We were on the 25th floor and was very quiet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:00:02.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
