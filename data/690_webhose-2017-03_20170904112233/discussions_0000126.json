First off, the property is simply stunning. From the art to the beautiful atrium architecture, The Beekman makes a great first impression. The service is first class as well. What I liked the most is that the staff anticipated our needs before we even had to ask.The property has amazing restaurants too! Tom Colicchio's, Augustine, is a must if you are visiting New York. The location is great as well. You are in walking distance to awesome coffee shops (La Columbe, The Birch), bars (Blacktail) and restaurants (Augustine, Fowler and Wells). It's also just a few blocks from the World Trade Center Memorial and the Brooklyn Bridge. Needless to say, The Beekman won us over, and we will certainly be staying the the next time we visit NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:02:58.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
