We absolutely loved the music theme throughout the hotel. For the price we paid, we did not expect much so we were pleasantly surprised with how tasteful the d√©cor and furnishings were. There is also an ipod dock should you wish to listen to music and a mini bar. Yes the rooms are a little on the small size but it is Paris after all. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Madeline metro station and lovely little cafes and a Carrefour supermarket all within 10mins walk. Do not hesitate to book here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:40:51.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
