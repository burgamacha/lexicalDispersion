The room (executive room) is large enough compared to London Hotels. The bathroom is very nice also. You can reach to Picadilly line and District Line metro station in 10 minutes walk maximum. The Hotel is very close to shops and restaurants however it is on a very quite street. Breakfast is very good and staff is nice and helpful. London Lodge Hotel presents a good value for money in all senses.\nRoom Tip: I recommend executive room as it is large enough for two people.
