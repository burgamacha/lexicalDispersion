The hotel is in an amazing location. Across from Chelsea Market, near the district of Chelsea with great shops, cafes and galleries and the Meatpacking District. The Whitney Museum is near as well as the fabulous High Line. Room was small, bathroom was very tiny but for one person it worked perfectly.
