I gave it 4 stars not because of grand lobbies or their famous chef but because they do 'comfortable' very, very well.\nIts new, immaculate, full of thoughtful touches (one of the chairs in our room had a platform, like a school desk, for our computer to sit on, a fountain of fresh mineral water on each floor WITH new bottles so you can just go out and enjoy the sights with fresh water in hand, an electronic thermostat so you can change the room temp without getting out of bed, refrig in room, etc).\nGreat view from our room.\nBeautiful 20 floor restaurant with great view and glass covered terrace for sunny dining.\nTerrific location 3 minutes from the WTC, Oculus, World Financial Center, Wall Street, Hudson River, subways to everywhere, zillions of upscale shops and restaurants.\nNo room safes but the front desk will give you a private box. You have the key to the box, they have the key to the room the boxes are in. Perhaps a little inconvenient but it seems safer to me than having my computer and documents in a 30lb safe in my room.\nGreat deal from Priceline Express.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:32:55.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
