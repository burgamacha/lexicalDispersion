The hotel room was clean and ready when we arrived. Gift bags for the kids were waiting in the room as apart of the package that we paid for. Breakfast was great and enjoyed by the whole family. The staff was friendly and ready to answer any and all questions. The staff kept DVDs at the front desk for the kids to pick from. The site was secure and we felt at home in the hotel room. The only thing missing was a second bathroom in our two bedroom suite. I highly recommend this place for families. Very kid friendly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:39:08.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
