I like everything but food and staff are simply amazing. Breakfast is really great! Room is lacking natural light (as i have just half of the big window in my room on the second floor) but very well equipped. Free handy phone provided by the hotel which could be used outside of the hotel is very convenient. I've met for the first time such a brilliant idea! Complementary fruits, water, tea and coffee are also very pleasent!\nRoom Tip: Ask a room with a full window See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:52:58.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
