It is a small 3 star hotel that is at the very top of it's class. The staff are friendly, welcoming, polite and helpful. The buffet style continental breakfast was excellent, as was the availability of excellent coffee free to guests throughout the day. My room was spotlessly clean, warm and comfortable, though a little small but entirely adequate for me as a lone traveller. I have no hesitation on recommending Hotel Raffaello to other visitors to Rome, and I will certainly try to book it again for my next trip.\nRoom Tip: Book early!
