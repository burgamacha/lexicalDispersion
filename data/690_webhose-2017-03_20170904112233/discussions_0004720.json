Service was incredible from greeting our kids with a visit to the treasure chest and welcome bags to a pre-race offering of motivational posters, snacks, and drinks in the lobby, followed up by an amazing customized bag of treats for us to take on our drive home! The service and staff were unbelievable, and we can't wait to come back. The room was big enough, not huge, but it's Manhattan so I don't expect a ton. Our room faced the Statue of Liberty, complete with a telescope perfectly positioned for a close up view. And the bellman was very patient with the kids constantly bumping it! You may think the Ritz Carlton is too pricey, but it's fairly reasonable for NYC prices-- comparable to the Marriott Marquis in price but way better in service. The location is a few minutes (maybe 3-5?) to a subway station but there are a few lines to choose from you so can get to anywhere you need to go. Staten Island Ferry is also very close. There aren't a ton of restaurants to choose from very near to the hotel, but if you are willing to walk about 10 minutes or take a short cab, there are plenty of options. Battery Park was very nice. Location was perfect for race watching, not far from the finish line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:08:56.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
