Only one lift was working so waiting time could be a while. If using the stairs they were very dark and quite dangerous.\nThe bar area was very worn with thread bare carpets.\nThe room itself was modern and trendy. The tv was supposed to be able to be used with your phone to watch netflix etc but this never worked despite numerous efforts and attempts.\nThe bathroom isn't the best design with the shower in the middle of the bath yet a screen that only cover half the bath so you have to stand in the corner to stop flooding the floor. The lights set into the wall above the toilet were hanging out of their sockets and need to be reset into place.\nThe only issue we encountered was trying to gain entry in to the hotel on the Sunday evening and having to wait 15 minutes outside in the rain with no shelter to be let in as the receptionist had locked the door as was helping someone in their room with something. When questioning why there is no other way to gain entry I was just told Sunday is quiet I work alone I don't understand your problem. There should be a card entry system like most other 4* hotels if the receptionist decides to lock the door, it wasn't even late only 10.30pm so hardly an unsavoury hour!\nI would stay here again though as the bed was very comfortable and the hotel is in a great location", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:39:17.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
