The good thing about the room was that it was very quiet and you could sleep well in a nice bed with good pillows. The bad thing was that there was no place to hang all the clothes and not even one drawer just some place where they had the hair dryer and stuff. I had to keep part of my clothes in the cabin bag. A nice touch was they left a chocolate and a biscuit every day. The toiletries were good quality and breakfast was very good with a la carte options and gluten free bread and cereals if you asked for them. Location is good because you have the tube station so near and there are lots of restaureants nearby. But the best thing about this hotel is the kind and helpful staff. Next time I have to go to London I will only return if the company I work for pays for a larger room ( I usually get an upgrade in other hotels just because I stay for 4 nights)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:22:40.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
