Just a short walk also takes you to buses - either over the river for Westminster and the West End or east to theatreland, Covent Garden or the City. Buses to Victoria Coach terminus leave right outside the front door. Just a short walk takes you to the London Eye and access to the Queens Walk as far along the Southbank as you feel like going. St Paul's cathedral is within walking distance via the Millennium Bridge. Tate Modern is closeby and the river taxis leave from near the London Eye for Tate Britain or east to Greenwich.\nThe hotel occupies an old maternity hospital building with two modern tower blocks attached. Staff on Reception are unfailing helpful and friendly (we have stayed here several times) and the rooms are extremely clean with spotless modern bathroom (showers) and very, very comfortable beds. If, like us, you are not used to city noise ask for a quiet room - those on the ground floor of the old hospital building, at the rear, may have no view, but they are very quiet - not even the ambulance/police sirens penetrate their serenity. The Premier full English breakfast is very good value for money with wholesome cooked and cold food and good strong coffee.\nThis is definitely our favourite Premier Inn in London.\nRoom Tip: For a view - highest floors, for silence - ground floor back room.
