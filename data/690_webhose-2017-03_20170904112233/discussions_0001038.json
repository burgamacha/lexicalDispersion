Staff are amazingly friendly, free minibar, great breakfast and a location that cannot be beaten. I will be going back.\nUpon arrival we were given a Guinness and a glass of prosecco. Our room was on the first floor and was very modern, nice big TV, huge bed and lovely bathroom. Two beers and a wine in the minbar as well as water and soft drinks that were topped up the next day. Breakfast is available up to 11am and is a buffet as well as a menu (free for both), food is lovely and not greasy at all (which usually happens with breakfast buffets). The location is ideal, Leicester Square is a short walk away and the hotel is next to embankment underground so you really can't beat it.\nGenuinely one of the nicest places I've stayed in. Easily in my top 5 and I've been to many a hotel. Great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:09:50.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
