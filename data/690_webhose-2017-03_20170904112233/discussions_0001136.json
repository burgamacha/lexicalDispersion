From the moment we walked in, the staff was very attentive to our needs and made us feel very welcome. The service and attention from the staff is among the best I have ever experienced. It is the perfect hotel for a few romantic nights in Paris. The decor is amazing- red velvet galore! Our room was fantastic- we had a junior suite and found it very comfortable. The cocktail bar is very cozy and chic, and the cocktail selection was yummy! And who can top, the private spa! If you are looking for a sexy retreat in Paris then this hotel is the one for you!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:59:00.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
