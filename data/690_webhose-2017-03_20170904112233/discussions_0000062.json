Many Cafes and Restaurants close by and great shopping too. Easy walk from RER and Metro stations with the Louvre and Notre Dame close by. Staff are really friendly and helpful. Hotel is going through some decoration so there is some work going on but even then the disruption is minimal. If you want a lovely hotel from which to explore Paris you will find this a great place to stay. It is our second visit and we will return\nIt is slightly on the expensive side but you get great rooms and great service", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:30:28.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
