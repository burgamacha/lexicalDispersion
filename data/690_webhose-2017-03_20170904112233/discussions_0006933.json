We had plays booked for each night of our trip. This was a perfect location to walk to all of the theaters even with heels and in the cold. The theaters are all within a few blocks in either direction. It's also an easy location to get to public transportation to get around the city. The bell captain was very helpful in getting taxis and arranging cars.\nThe rooms are nice but not 5 star. They are nicer than you usually find in NYC. The service was good. The food on the property was over priced in my opinion but it was probably appropriate for the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:19:28.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
