Great decor, impeccably clean, fantastic service, excellent breakfast, comfortable and cosy rooms with good bathroom and excellent water pressure on the shower.\nI actually stayed on business but it's more of a leisure hotel and would be perfect for a weekend stay in Paris with friends, relatives or partners. That said, I'm going to stay here again when I go back to Paris and wouldn't hesitate to stay her for leisure.\nDeserves the high praise.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:33:20.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
