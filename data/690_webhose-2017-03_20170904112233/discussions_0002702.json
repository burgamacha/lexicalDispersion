I liked my choice as it is near to metro (just 50 meters from hotel). even by walking it takes around 20 minutes to go to the convention center.\nBig rooms were a nice surprise. for breakfast there are 2 options : coffee with croissant for 7 euro , or buffet for 15 euro. one day I tried buffet menu and came to conclusion it better to have breakfast outside for the same money. Just next to the hotel there is supermarket.\nIn the room there is coffee machine and each day they provide 4 capsules for free, although in my room there were always only 3 capsules. The hotel is clean. Very small elevator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:00:00.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
