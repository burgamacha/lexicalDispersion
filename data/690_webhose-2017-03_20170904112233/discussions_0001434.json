We were fortunate to find this small hotel in the Saint-Germain des Pr√©s area. The Clement Hotel has a Junior Suite on each floor that has a full size bed in one room and an additional room with a twin. Two of us shared a good-sized full bed in the bedroom facing the street and one daughter got the other room to herself, with a window onto a little courtyard. The main room was quite small but not tiny, and there is enough room to function. The bathroom is a little tight, but the shower is fantastic. We requested a lower floor because other reviews had warned that the elevator is small, and the management accommodated our request.\nThe staff was friendly and courteous throughout our stay. This location is in walking distance to so many attractions and close to Metro stations. The area has many restaurants of many varieties, and there is a covered market across the street (as well as a grocery store) where we often bought fruit, pastry, and coffee for breakfast.\nI would certainly stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:15:35.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
