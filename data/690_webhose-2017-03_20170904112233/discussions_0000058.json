Took some visitors from Germany for an afternoon tea experience and it didnt disappoint! Food is lovely, the scones, especially the chocolate ones, were sublime. Service was attentive especially from Marius the restaurant supervisor who made my guests feel very welcome to the hotel and London as for one it was the first time in the U.K. A 5 for him.\nWe had the Charlie and the chocolate themed classic afternoon tea which my guests absolutely loved. Word of warning dont eat all the second plate of sandwiches if you want to eat all the cakes!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:04:04.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
