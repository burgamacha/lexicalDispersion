My suggestion would be ensure you book a superior room on arrival we were greeted by Scott (a really nice guy) he gave us the keys and when we arrived into the room were very disappointed it was tiny however from my research before the trip I knew this was some mistake as it looked like a standard room - I felt uneasy about this couldn't see myself staying in that room for four nights - so I rang down to Scott right away and he has somebody drop us keys to a new room which was a HUGE improvement - it was bigger than I imagined and it looked bigger than the images too. We were both happy with the room size, the bed etc. The room was lovely, the hotel itself really is just room and the 10th floor has wifi and good views. I didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as there was so much to be doing. Location wise it was about 30 minute walk to times square, there was alway subs near by and you could always flag down a cab. The area was nice which restaurants and bars near by however I did end up getting alot of cabs while I was there so I think for my next trip I will stay somewhere a bit more central. By the way for breakfast do go to bagel express it's amazing and super cheap!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:25:38.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
