We first planned only to go for dinner however after we like the services as well as the beauty of the place we decided to take an Executive Room.\nThe smiling and very attentive staff at reception offered us probably the room with best view over looking the lake as well as the pool.\nWe enjoyed every moment there and were then the Duty Manager allowed us late check out which is highly appreciated as we slept really late.\nA great place for dining as well as for staying.
