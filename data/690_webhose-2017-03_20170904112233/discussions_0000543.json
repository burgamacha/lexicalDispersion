By taking Roissybus, I could reach the hotel very easily. It took just several minutes from the Roissybus station to the hotel on foot. The location of this hotel was perfect for me: within walking distance to Palais Garnier, Champs-Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre museum, and even to Notre Dame in Cite island. What is noteworthy about this 5-star hotel in addition to its location should be its amenities: Hermes bathroom amenities and Dammann Freres tea bags. The bed was very comfortable, and the room temperature could be adjusted in the room. If I mention one negative thing about this hotel, the bathtub/shower switching lever was broken at midnight. However, the hotel immediately arranged us another room (of the same grade, but with better view), and there was actually no inconvenience. Breakfast buffet was satisfieable, and I especially enjoyed their croissants and coffee. If I visit Paris again, I will definitely choose this hotel again. It was such a lovely 5-day stay in Paris.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:47:51.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
