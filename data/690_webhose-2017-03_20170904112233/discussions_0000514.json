The bathroom had a variety of amenities for guest use, showing the Marriott / Protea pedigree. Great was the extended balcony from where Lake Victoria in all its beauty was visible through the leaves of the palm trees between the hotel and the shore.\nI was booked for two nights but only stayed one, being a Kampala resident, something I did regret in the end as my visit to the Protea Entebbe exceeded my expectations and I wish I had a second day to sample all their services and facilities.\nAll food was served from a buffet with a range of choices of cold and hot dishes, plus dessert, service was swift and the quality of the meals really good.\nThe hotel is adding rooms, almost doubling the present size, but without much impact on guests. It goes to show that location and service levels make the Protea a hotel in high demand and after my stay I understand why that is so.\nComes highly recommended for a first night or last night stay of guests wishing to be right close to the airport, which main gate is just a kilometre away from the hotel.\nRoom Tip: Upper floor rooms offer a better view across Lake Victoria See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:51:41.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
