The hotel is great, we had a corner room which was large, and had great views of the Hudson. It's a snap to get on the 1,2 or 3 train up to Times Square. Or you can always take a cab or a ride-share service. We had dinner at Morton's which is 1/2 block away. There is a mall across the street, Trinity Church, the Freedom Tower, etc. for sightseeing and if you walk over to the other side of Broadway there are more restaurants and night-life. To get a room this great for under $150 a night in NYC is amazing!\nRoom Tip: River view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:50:25.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
