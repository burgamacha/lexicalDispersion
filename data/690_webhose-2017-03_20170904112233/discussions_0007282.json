The room was spotlessly clean. The coffee machine and kettle and cups and mugs were so clean they looked brand new. The bed was very comfortable, we both had a good nights sleep. We were very lucky having such good views. As we didn't eat here I can't comment on the food. We had a very warm friendly welcome and given a map of London and shown on the map directions where we wanted to go.
