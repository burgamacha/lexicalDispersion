I got a great AAA deal and it made the stay affordable. Amazing staff, both for reservations (I had to change a date and staff was accomidating), check in, check out and bell staff who held my luggage while I finished sightseeing. I wish I had a chance to have breakfast or visit the restaurant/bar - I'm sure it would have been just as amazing. The location was close to the theatre district, walking distance from Grand Central - couldn't ask for more!\nWhenever I'm back in NYC, I will definitely look to stay here again and recommend it to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:26:47.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
