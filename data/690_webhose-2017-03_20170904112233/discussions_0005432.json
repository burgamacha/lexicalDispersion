The lobby is beautiful & so was my room. Check in went fast & smooth. Everyone was nice. Got a chance to get 500 bonus points towards my HHonors membership. We went right up to our room with no hassle. The elevators were working very efficiently & fast. You're not waiting around for an elevator for a long time. There's plenty of elevators too. My room was perfect. It was very clean &' I loved the bathroom. The bathroom may also be the reason I come back, lol. I love the lightning in the bathroom. I care a lot about lightning in hotel bathrooms and Hilton Times Square succeeded in that!\nThe only problem I had was the water draining out slowly, other than that.. it was fine! I was only there for 1 night sadly, I didn't want to leave. But I will be sure to come back here!
