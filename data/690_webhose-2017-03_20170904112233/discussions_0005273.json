The La Defence is very friendly towards pedestrian traffic as it is all built on ramps and walkways so one never has to deal with the motorized traffic. The hotel is clean and modern and offers a good breakfast at a good price and also a so called \"City breakfast\" for those not wanting to eat that much in the morning. The hotel also offers a room service 24/7 in case someone wishes to have meals delivered to the rooms. The staff is very friendly and I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel with an excellent location at a fair price.\nRoom Tip: If possible ask for a room with view over the river Seine See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:55:42.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
