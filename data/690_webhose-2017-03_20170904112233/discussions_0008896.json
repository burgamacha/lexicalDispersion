Wifi is included. The bathroom had a lovely walk in shower with plenty of soaps, lotion, shampoo refilled every day. Our room was exceptionally quiet. Tea and coffee were in the room with some biscuits - one packet person - perfect upon returning from a day's outing.\nStaff are all extremely helpful. The breakfast is both a continental and full hot breakfast. Staff in the breakfast room were superb in keeping items replenished and with their prompt, friendly service. We did notice a laundry room outside the breakfast room but did not use it.\nThe location is near Paddington Station, an easy two block walk. There are many good restaurants within a several block walking distance. Hyde Park is only about three blocks away.\nWe would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:51:06.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
