I would say it's a single occupancy room not a double room there was hardly any room to move however we did book a standard room not a premium room so maybe that's why it was smaller. In the room there was a double bed, tiny wardrobe, a mini bar and TV. The TV had several english speaking channels including channel 4! The bathroom itself was average, there was a small shower with a tiny door and the hairdryer wasn't the best. The hotel would be better off providing a small hand held hair dryer. The lift in the hotel is tiny and was rather slow. The d√©cor of the hotel was done nicely, the reception area is pleasant and there is a mac computer free for guests to use the internet and even print off documents such as boarding passes. The hotel receptionist was very helpful and I couldn't fault her service. We did not have breakfast in the hotel and ate out every day. The restaurant next door is AMAZING definitely recommended. The location of the hotel is good and isn't a far walk from a metro station and Eiffel tower itself. I would probably stay at this hotel again for the location and price, but I would ask not to be put in room 50 unless I was staying alone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:12:52.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
