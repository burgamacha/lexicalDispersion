Very stylish room, with good temperature controls, innovative lighting arrangements, all around a great experience. Highly recommend. Easy walk to several subway lines, and even found on street parking, although had to sit out a 90 minute period for street cleaning, like all the other locals. Oh, and delicious pastries in the morning, with coffee/tea all day.\nRoom Tip: king rooms face street, queen rooms a little quieter in back, but either great, we tried both!
