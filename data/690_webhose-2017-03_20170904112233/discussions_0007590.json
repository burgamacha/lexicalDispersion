I've stayed in a few Premier Inns for business and they are 'fine' but nothing that you'd usually write home about so I was a bit worried that 'hub' would be a worse form of a Premier Inn.\nI was wrong. This 'hub' compares very well to a regular Premier Inn although some of that may be that this hotel is very new and so everything is shiny and works.\nOne thing I'd say - I walked past the hotel twice before finding it although it's really not hard to find once you've seen it and it's nearest to Aldgate East tube but it's also fairly near to Liverpool Street and it's an easy walk into Shoreditch so the location is fine and I like the neighbourhood as there's quite a buzz to being on Brick Lane although there was no noise in the hotel to disturb sleep etc.\nCheck in here is entirely automated - you tap on a touch screen and it issues a key and you're off to your room although there was a friendly member of staff there to help if it didn't work. It worked fine.\nOn the ground floor there's some kind of breakfast caf√© (looked fine, I didn't use it) and a station where you can make (free) tea and coffee as that's not in the room although they do give you some water.\nMy room was on the ground floor. It was clean, it was modern (everything's driven off controls built into the wall). It was also fairly small (hence the 'pod' in the title) but it suited me fine and I've had smaller hotel rooms in London. Strangely, the bathroom was quite big by comparison.\nFor a 2 night stay or for a business stay or a stay where you're a tourist and are not spending much time in your room this is all absolutely fine and I had no problems with the 'hub' while I was there and I'd happily stay there again on a similar basis.\nIf you're looking for a hotel with a lounge and a fancy bar and a doorman then you'd need to look elsewhere but, for this stay, the 'hub' worked fine for me and I'd go back there on a similar basis.\nMy bill was emailed to my while in my room and I simply dropped the key and walked out of the door when it was time to check out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:49:03.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
