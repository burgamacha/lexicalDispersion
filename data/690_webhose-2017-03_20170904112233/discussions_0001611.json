I've been in Kimptons all around the US, from SF to DC, LA, OH, UT, WA, OR, FL, PA etc. I know the company is changing but overall I'm a huge fan of the brand.\nThis was my first time at the Muse, and I really liked it. It's classic Kimpton...clean, modern, well-appointed. Not kitschy nor pretentious. The staff was professional and warm. The night auditor Tony was superb, a real professional.\nI only stayed one night so I didn't get to check out the restaurant, gym etc but in terms of the room (double queen) and staff I can't think of anything I'd change. Except maybe the $10 Fred water but it's NYC right? Besides, the raid the mini bar card was $15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:07:21.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
