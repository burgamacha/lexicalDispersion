Staff is very friendly as well. The only minor drawback is that my room (Number 1) only had one power outlet, which made it impossible to charge all of the devices we nowadays carry around over night. I would have also preferred a bottle of water with a glass inside the room over the free Bar at the reception.\nAll in all value for many was unbeatable in Paris. I'll come back! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:05:01.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
