You may hear a little street or alley noise, but you are in the middle of the city. We really liked this hotel and will stay here when coming back to Rome. The staff here is as good as it gets, very nice to us tourists and patient, and staff speaks English which is nice. Very friendly staff set us up with a bus tour and the bus came right to the hotel front door to pick us up. We didn't have a car in Rome and would not want one here anyway, as it is too crowded and nowhere to park. Plus the public transportation around this hotel is great. You can take the subway unlimited riding 24 hours for 7 euros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:04:51.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
