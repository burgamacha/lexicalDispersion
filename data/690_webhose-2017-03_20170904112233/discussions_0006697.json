The staff is the best of any hotel I've been to including many 4 and 5 star properties. Location is great in the heart of Kensington.Like many London hotels, the room itself wasn't big and the bathroom was even smaller but the amenities were all very modern and the overall stay was great. Also, having arrived after a six hour flight, early access to the room in the morning plus a nice steaming hot shower with great water pressure was just what was needed. Didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant nor go to the gym there but the hotel was great. The Natural History Museum as well as the Victoria and Albert Museums are nearby. Many restaurant options within a couple of blocks. One odd thing was this unidentified aroma (food?) in the second floor hallways always greeted me upon exiting the elevator. Nothing major but preferred if it wasn't.\nRoom Tip: Room facing Queens Gate road preferred See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:57:46.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
