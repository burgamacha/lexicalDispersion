It's in a great location, just a few blocks from the Metro. There are lots of fun places to eat and shop just a few steps away. We walked to various sites such as the Louvre and Notre Dame. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The staff was just the best -- always happy to assist. We chose to have the continental breakfast at the hotel each morning. It was great. The wifi also worked very well. Note that the hotel does not have an elevator, but the staff offered to carry our luggage to our room. For a future trip to Paris, they are at the top of my list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:16:33.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
