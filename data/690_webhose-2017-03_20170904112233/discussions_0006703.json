About 20 minutes walk to Notre Dame. Our room was quite small (as were all the others I think), with en-suite bath and shower (hand-held and no curtain), to the rear of the hotel so it was very quiet. Tiny lift, with barely room for one person and a case! We took the stairs so quite tiring up to the 5th floor. Breakfast at €13 seemed expensive so we ate elsewhere (plenty of cafés etc. in the vicinity). Only reason not 5 stars is size of room and shower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:42:25.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
