The room was small, but we didn't need anything bigger, and the layout of the room didn't make it feel cramped. It felt light and airy! The staff at the front desk were incredibly polite and helpful. They stored our luggage for us until we were able to check in and provided helpful tips and a map of the city. The location of this hotel is unparalleled. It is less than a 5 minute walk to the Trocadero where you can get amazing views of the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is convenient to everything but was still quiet at night. Would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:32:47.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
