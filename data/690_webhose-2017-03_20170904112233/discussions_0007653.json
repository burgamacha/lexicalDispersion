The check in was informal but extremely courteous and warm. The lift is very dark and smells odd. Feels a little haunted house like. My room was well appointed. Beautiful vintage furnishings. Sheets and bedding were perfect. Fresh, soft and extremely comfortable like the mattress. Excellent pillows and duvet. The bathroom is too dimly lit for my preference with only a light above the mirror. The shower was ok in terms of heat but the shower head was hanging out slightly of the wall. Not great aesthetically. Pressure was fine but not incredible. All the lamps were pretty and had to be switched off separately. Charming if not slightly inconvenient with no overhead lighting. No coffee, tea or complimentary amenity in room. Extensive mini bar though since they do not have food or room service in the hotel. Perfect if you love boutique hotels and want to feel transported back to another time in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:01:21.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
