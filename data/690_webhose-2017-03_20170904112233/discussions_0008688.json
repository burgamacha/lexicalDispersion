Two subway station, few bus stop, railroad station, many nice restaurant, pub, supermarket are very close. Walk distance and easy access to many major sites. With kitchen, you can enjoy London like you live there. Service is also great and very friendly. You need room card to enter the hotel. I feel very secure. They only have body shampoo and soap. This is more like apartment but recommend. They do not clan the room everyday but you can have towels and papers etc by request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:17:46.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
