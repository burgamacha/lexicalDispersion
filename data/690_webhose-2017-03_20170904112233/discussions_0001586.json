We stayed in a family room which was v spacious (even with a double, single, couch bed) and had a daily replenished supply of water, tea coffee and biscuits (v handy to stash in the bags for sightseeing) as well as good TV and a fridge. Walking distance to some major sites including Colosseum (15 mins) and Navona (20 mins) and a short stroll (2 mins) to the Republica metro stop which whisks you to the Vatican in around 10 mins via Spagna on the Red line. The food in the lovely bright and spacious breakfast room was fresh, delicious, piping hot and was continually replenished - and a superb array of choice (we were expecting pastries and coffee and were pleasantly surprised at the selection!). The only quibble people may have is that this is a very modern hotel in an ancient city and therefore some may find it a little soulless (despite the friendly vibe and the cosy bar upstairs), but to us it was perfect and I could not recommend it highly enough. Super friendly and helpful staff too by the way. Top marks!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:48:36.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
