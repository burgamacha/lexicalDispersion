We were able to check in early which was really sweet and even more, got upgraded to a Romantic Room since they knew we were celebrating our anniversary. All members of staff are delightful and very very attentive from the F&B, front desk and housekeeping (they even cleaned the room twice a day which was a big wow - the first night when we got back in the room the bed was done again, new coffee pads were provided and rose pedals were spread all across the bed - I actually thought I entered someone else's room hehe).\nThe breakfast is super delicious and offers plenty of variety plus a yammy coffee. The spa is absolutely divine. We were lucky not to bump into any other guests while using it so it felt like private. The rooms are excellent with fantastic facilities including a Nespresso machine and a iMac.\nThe only down side we saw was their room service. A few nights we got quite hungry and all they had was a play of charcuterie. That being said I suppose they should either not say they offer this service or actually improve the stock/room service menu.\nLeaving this small detail aside I cannot stress enough what a great find this is.\nCertainly recommend it to everyone and definitely will be coming back (hopefully soon).", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:07:15.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
