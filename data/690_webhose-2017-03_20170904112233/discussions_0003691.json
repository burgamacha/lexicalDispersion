Our stay at the Standard was fantastic. From our room we could see the Jersey Shore, Hudson River, and the Statue of Liberty. Breathtaking view it was indeed! Lead Concierge Tim Markman and his staff were very accommodating and went out their way to make sure our stay was perfect. The Le Bain lounge on the top of the Standard is a must see! I would highly recommend this hotel and when there ask Tim for local recommendations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:59:31.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
