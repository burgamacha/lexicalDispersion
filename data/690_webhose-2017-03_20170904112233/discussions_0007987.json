We stayed at the Novotel London Blackfriar for 6 days. It was overall a fantastic stay. The room was stylish and cozy. The bed was especially noteworthy--very comfortable. Even though we were on the second floor, we all sleep soundly throughout our stay. The location could not have been better. We were a skip and a hop from the Southwark tube station and could walk to many landmarks including the London Eye and the Tower of London (albeit a long walk). The neighboorhood had many fantastic restaurants in all price ranges. We also enjoyed the spa and pools facilities--they were well tended and clean and offered a good respite in an otherwise hectic week.\nThe only drawback was the bathroom. Although it was stylish, there was little privacy. Yes, there is a self-fogging window separating the room from the bathroom but it still leaves little to the imagination. It wasn't much of a drawback in our situation but I could see it being somewhat tricky for people who are not close family or a bit bashful.\nBreakfast, which was included in our price, was fine. Nothing to rave about but certainly filling and offering many choices. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Novotel London Blackfriar for a family vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:50:34.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
