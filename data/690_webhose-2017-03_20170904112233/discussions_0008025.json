I spend many nights in London but this was my first stay in this locale and hotel is ideally situated. Room was spotless and spacious. The place has a sort of gentlemen's club ambience, dark wood and masculine decor - not sure if that's the impression they want to create but it works well. I didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the quality of the dining. Price was very good value considering the location. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:19:16.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
