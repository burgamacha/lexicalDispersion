I couldn't believe how much was on our doorstep. We had a lovely twin room (double beds) with stunning views of the chrysler building. Beds were very comfortable, plenty of storage in the rooms and soft fresh towels every day. There was no noise from outside or inside the hotel and staff were very friendly and helpful when we needed anything and they helped us with a car service back to JFK. I agree with the comments that there are elements that need updating and good to see that the hotel is on top of this. However, I have already recommended this hotel to friends and family and wouldn't hesitate to visit again.\nWe didn't eat in the hotel and there are great cafes / restaurants within a 10 minute walk.\nThanks for a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:45:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
