I arrived early and was unable to check into my room until 3pm, which gave me about an hour and a half to burn.\nI went and enjoyed the some grilled fish and a few cups of coffee at Vine, which is accessible from the lobby sitting area. Both the fish dish and the coffee were great and I was able to get some work done.\nAt check-in, I was upgraded to a room on a higher floor. I didn't view this as a tremendous bonus until I arrived at my room and took in the incredible view from the 22nd floor. It was truly an upgrade and really made all the difference in my stay.\nI was able to also catch dinner at Lupulo, which is not accessible via the lobby, but literally a few steps outside the front door. Our dinner and drinks were tremendous.\nOverall, this is a very well located and well-appointed boutique in NY. I would recommend this to anyone on business or leisure.\nGreat spot -- I'll return for sure. Hopefully not on business next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:46:42.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
