Though the room was small, which is to be expected, it contained everything that we could possibly need, cleverly hidden in various nooks and corners! The Nespresso machine was an added bonus, as was the rain shower. Staff were extremely helpful, in particular Jeff and Marjorie, who made us feel completely at home! Location was fab for us, near 2 metro stations, and if you walk down to Argentine, which is 5 minutes away, there is the most amazing bakery! The pocket WIFI that we borrowed from the hotel came in very handy for us too. Highly recommend this hotel :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:58:49.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
