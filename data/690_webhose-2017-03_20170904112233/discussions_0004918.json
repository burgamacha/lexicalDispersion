Staff went out of the way to welcome us and breakfast was something ours boys wanted to wake up early to make sure and get before heading out! Less than 5 minute walk to Arc and very centrally located. The family room was wonderful - we had room with queen bed and shower and boys had 2 twin beds with bath/shower. Perfect amount of privacy for both. Very accommodating with every request - had them get us tickets to the catacombs and literally 4 staff members the next day asked to make sure we had received them. Would happily stay here again! We also ate at the restaurant across the street and just down from them - both were great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:34:49.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
