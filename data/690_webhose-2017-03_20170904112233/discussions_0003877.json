For the purpose, its location could not be better, as it is at one corner of Washington Square Park. My wife had to be at an early session of a conference, and the hotel was very accommodating; there was a room available(414), and they allowed me in at about 9:30 a.m., at no extra charge. It had no view to speak of; I expect that the rooms with views had been occupied, and thus were not available yet. Not a problem. The room is small, but not extraordinarily so at this price point. Everything worked, there is a small closet and a bathroom. Furnishings have an art deco vibe. It was an extremely cold day, and I watched TV for a while, until it was time for me to leave.\nThere is a passage from the hotel lobby to the hotel's restaurant, which was very convenient on a frigid evening. Dinner there was excellent (reviewed separately.)\nNext morning, we had breakfast in the small cafe area off the lobby, where the offerings included bagels, small croissants, bread, small muffins, fresh fruit cup, jellies, Nutella, coffee, juice, etc. If you wish to go beyond the free continental breakfast, a full breakfast menu is available in the restaurant (in addition to the continental breakfast buffet).\nThe staff was quite friendly and helpful in all respects. If I needed to be in the downtown area overnight again, I would not hesitate to stay here once more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:56:30.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
