I have been traveling to New York City for more than 40 years for business. I have stayed in more hotels than I can remember. Some I will never forget because of lack of service, staff and so on. The London NYC is over the top great. I booked the trip to celebrate my wife’s 62nd birthday and spent time with my son while in the city. From the moment we pulled up the staff was there for us. We got in late in the evening and the manager told us if we needed anything just asked and he would take care of it. We went up to the 27th floor and looked out at Central Park from a great mini suite. We had an outer sitting area, bedroom with walk though closet and large bathroom.\nThe staff at the bar was great. The selections were perfect and in the morning the breakfast buffet was very nice and extensive. I have my own business and my philosophy is just like The London NYC, “If I treat you the way I would like to be treated, then I know I will have a customer for life”.\nThe value I received for the money I paid was great and I don’t know of another hotel that could rival The London. I was there less than 20 days ago and I have recommended The London NYC to three couples. You will find yourself at the top of Times Square, away from the noise and just blocks from Central Park. My wife has not stopped talking about it and is already making plans to go back. Thank you to all the staff . I will be a customer for life!
