We spent 3 nights at this hotel in total within a weeks time due to travel. Rooms were clean. Beds were comfortable. Staff were exceptionally well mannered and friendly and helpful, especially Ulysses at the front desk. What a pleasure it was to get to interact with him twice during out stay. The hotel is steps away from the underground; Gloucester Station, and you are just a few stops away from the city centre. You can walk to many location from the hotel as well. There are restaurants close by, if you chose not to eat at the hotel. We enjoyed our stay and if we are ever in London again, we will for sure be staying at the Crown Plaza Kensignton. Thanks for a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:22:47.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
