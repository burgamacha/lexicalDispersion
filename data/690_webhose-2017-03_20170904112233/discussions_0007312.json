Room was clean, amenities are modern, however kitchen is very small and had no windows, contrary to the photos on the website. Daily cleaning service is free of charge. Location is a bit hard to find for the taxis and the view is to the motorway. Good for a business traveller but not so much for a family with kids. However nice service from the staff and good price, especially if you book directly at the hotel website.\nRoom Tip: ask for a room at higher floors See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:09:27.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
