Everything was as expected at a luxury hotel on 57th Street. The front desk service, concierge, and doormen were all very pleasant and attentive, making all guests feel the same level of special. The rooms were very clean and very up to date with the newest technology. I won this stay as a raffle gift from my employer, however, I would definitely book a room at this hotel in the future. The only thing I would add would be validation for parking and a gift shop selling their wonderful smelling toiletry products and candles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:18:28.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
