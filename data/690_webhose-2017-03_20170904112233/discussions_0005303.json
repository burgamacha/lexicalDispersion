Wife and I decided to take the bus into NYC. The hotel is a short walk from the station which was appreciated due to the cold weather. Arrived at hotel a few hrs prior to check-in and had lunch at Paul's, the hotel restaurant. Lunch was delicious and very reasonable, $8 for a burger and $9 for a personal pizza. The service was attentive and the restaurant is small with a friendly vibe. Our primary objective was the wax museum and a show at the Lyric theater. Again with the location. Less than a 5 minute walk to both. We booked a King corner with Times square view. Room was clean with floor to ceiling windows. Although fairly small the room is more than adequate for a 1 or 2 night stay. We liked Paul's so much we went back for dinner after the show. Again the food was excellent. If you need to stay in the theater district this is a good bet. Only down side was a billing dispute with the restaurant. I'm confident it will be worked out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:22:41.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
