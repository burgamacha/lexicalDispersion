It is about 100yds from the Louvre adjacent to Les Tuileries in a quiet side road away from the traffic.\nRooms are on the small side but very well appointed, very comfortable and ideal for couples.\nThe staff and the service they provide is faultless and in fact goes above and beyond anything we expected or even hoped for. Nothing was too much trouble and they made what was already a very enjoyable weekend an absolute treat.\nYou can buy tickets for the museums from the Hotel and they will research and advise you on pretty much anything you need, for example they found us a great bar we could go to watch the six nations match England v France, and were even decent enough to congratulate us afterwards when England won.\nHighly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to have a fabulous stay in this lovely city - don't pay any more for what might appear to be a fancier option, you wont be disappointed.\nRoom Tip: Any should be fine See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:33:22.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
