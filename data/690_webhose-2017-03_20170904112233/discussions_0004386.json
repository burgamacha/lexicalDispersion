We weren't really that fussed so didn't ask the staff.\nGreat hotel, friendly staff, the rooms are small but very clean. The beds are SO COMFY.\nI would only not recommend this hotel if you are a wheel chair user - tiny lifts and very tight corners in the corridors/hallway. They may have rooms on the ground floor to accommodate this (I'm not sure).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:18:59.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
