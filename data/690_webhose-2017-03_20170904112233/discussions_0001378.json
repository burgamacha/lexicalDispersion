I wanted to make sure this was a very special weekend and flowers would be delivered to my room upon arrival. When I called I had the incredible honor to speak directly with Paola. (A Guest Service Host.) Her customer service was simply over the top-and willing and able to make sure I had exactly what I needed for this incredible vacation. We were in constant communication for about three weeks to make sure this was a birthday we would never forget for my Husband. Paola was invaluable to the success of this wonderful vacation. Upon our arrival we had a flawless check in.... The hotel is Simply Beautiful, minimalistic with the decor and yet warm and friendly at the same time. Clean and spotless....It was a true Hyatt. ( I was so impressed by the staff and by Paola , who, come to find out, stayed past her shift an hour or so extra to make sure we were checked in and satisfied. THANK YOU) We then opened the door to our room....OMG .... Breathtaking Paola and her team had arranged a birthday greeting, the flowers all arranged in beautiful bouquets, and a welcome note from the Hyatt Hotel Staff. Needless to say we were overcome with emotion.... Being in the customer service industry this type of over-the-top help and sincere dedication does not go unnoticed. ( Words cannot express the deep gratitude we have for the incredible room that was arranged and the wonderful view of the Empire State Building.)\nCome to find out, our weekend had only just begun with the first 10 minutes of arrival, Incredible customer service and beautiful room and greetings. From beginning to end everyone knew our name... Everyone offered warm greetings, a happy birthday and ask if there was anything they could do to improve our stay or to help in any way possible. Honestly? How could they improve on perfection? During our stay we had the great pleasure of meeting the following people who were absolutely impeccable at what they do - guest service: Adam, Graciela, Calvin, Alicia, Susana,Kathy, Genesis, Nali, Jealy, Marybeth. But I can't stop there....Matt, Jarrett, Brenda, Cynthia and Modu I know I have misspelled several names and I apologize You all deserve incredible recognition.\nif you know this from other reviews that I have done.... a clean and spotless room are very important to me and this was no exception. Beautiful room, clean and grand Housekeeping was wonderful.\nI know I am missing several employees names and I apologize But please know you are the reason I stay with Hyatt. At times, a room can be room, and then there other times where an experience is over-the-top and overwhelming - this was that experience A huge thank you to the Hyatt team for making us feel at home and a vacation we will never forget. A special THANK YOU to Paola for all you did for us You will never be forgotten and always a part of our first vacation to NYC Hyatt....Keep up the great work!!!! We shall see you all in the fall time Ohhhh....And go to the roof top bar for the view and the Den for a drink or bite to eat Who knows....You may be involved in a Long Island Ice Tea competition that will leave you laughing for days. Memories we will now always have!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:43:40.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
