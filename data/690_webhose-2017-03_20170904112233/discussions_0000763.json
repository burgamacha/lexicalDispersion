Hotel is gorgeous. Beautifully decorated, so eclectic, so full of colour, bright and quirky. Checking in was easy. I'm sorry I don't remember any of the names of staff at reception but they were all helpful and very efficient. We were in Room no. 1 next to the courtyard. Yes small, like everyone else has said but seriously, we left the room early and got back late, so we didn't need larger room. Beautifully decorated. Amazing shower. I don't like baths and we had a great walk in shower with tiny lights in the walls. Very clean. Hotel 5 minute walk from Metro, right next to an amazing patisserie I think called Patisserie du Pantheon. Next to Sorbonne and lots of cafes and restaurant. It's the Latin Quarter, very clean and safe. Will definitely return! Sorry, we didn't have breakfast, so can't comment but having free coffee and sparkling water is brilliant! thanks so much everyone at le Petit! Hope to see you again soon.\nRoom Tip: It's winter so room no. 1 with courtyard was great, have no idea what it would be like in summer...
