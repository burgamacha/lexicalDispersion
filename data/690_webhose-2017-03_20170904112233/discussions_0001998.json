We had a wonderful experience from the moment we drove up to the Hotel. Pedro with the valet service was WONDERFUL and very sweet. He welcomed us with a warm smile and a great personality. The other Valet staff/security throughout the weekend were also great and always welcomed us with a friend greeting upon leaving and arriving back at the hotel. AL is by far a gem at this place. We asked him where to go for dinner and he recommended Fabio Cucina Italiana that was just across the street. He set everything up for us! He made the reservation the same day for our desired time and gave me a card to give the employees at the restaurant with his name on it. It was GREAT not having to worry about reservations and I have to say, the recommendation was INCREDIBLE. Needless to say, AL hooked us up! We had the best treatment at a restaurant that I have ever had. They knew exactly why we were there and the restaurant treated us great. Al was genuinely so happy that he could help us on our fun weekend vacation. I highly recommend staying here. The rooms were great, noise was controlled, easily accessible, and a great location. We will definitely be back and I sure hope Pedro and Al are both still around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:37:27.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
