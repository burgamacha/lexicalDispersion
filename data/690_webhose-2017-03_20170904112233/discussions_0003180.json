Such a beautiful place! Wine pairing was really enjoyable and the gentleman who delivered the session to us was very knowledgable! The restaurant was beautiful and all staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful! Our favourite part was the picnic, enjoying the food and wine whilst sitting on a picnic blanket enjoying the surroundings and sunshine was just heavenly. The only negative I have is that I can't purchase the wine in the uk very easily and after sampling Spiers wine nothing is good enough! I am now onto my last bottle.. would def recommend a visit!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:42:35.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
