It's really well located, not too far from either Gare du Nord, the Marais or the central Paris sights like the Louvre. In fact I didn't need to use the Metro at all during my stay which was a nice bonus - everywhere I wanted to go, including the left bank, was within walking distance. Staff were incredibly friendly and extremely helpful in all regards - thank you so much for making a brief stay so easy! The room itself was small but clean and well appointed with a petite but functional en suite. Breakfast was pretty decent and fairly priced - I really liked the 'express' option which presented particularly excellent value. No minibar which suited me fine but could be an issue for others. I'd highly recommend this hotel as a budget option for a Parisian minibreak!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:53:52.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
