We were cheerfully greeted with a cold beer each on our (late evening) arrival. The room (a so-called \"cosy\" room on the booking sites) was clean and newly decorated (with a very new looking bathroom) and wasn't at all cramped despite its name. We were facing onto the street but didn't hear anything through the double glazing. Breakfast (included in our booking but EUR10 otherwise) was far better than many French hotels we have stayed in. As well as the hotel looking after our bags for the day, we were offered the chance to change / shower / drink coffee when we returned to pick them up. Every staff member we had contact with was polite and cheerful. The location was ideal for us as an overnight stay between Eurostar (Gare du Nord) and a train leaving the next afternoon from Gare de l'Est. Both stations were an easy walk (which felt pretty safe even though we arrived after 11pm). We thought this hotel provided excellent value and we will definitely be returning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:59:25.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
