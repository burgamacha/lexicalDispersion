Traveling by myself & for such a short time I wanted a hotel that was in the immediate vicinity of the museum. I could not have gotten any closer without camping out at the Memorial! This hotel is located literally next door to the memorial & museum and is in easy walking distance to many restaurants, stores & historic sights. The next surprise for me was that the weekend room rate was so reasonable. I was not expecting to stay in Manhattan for such a reasonable rate - and imagine my surprise when I got to the hotel & saw how NICE it is! Very small room which I would have expected but very well laid out and nicely decorated. Great amenities and I was surprised to find that I even had a good view of the Empire State Building. Staff could not have been more friendly & helpful. They arranged car service for me before I arrived so I had a ride waiting to pick me up at Penn Station. The day I was to leave, they arranged for another Club Quarters to hold my luggage for me so I could sightsee in Midtown without having to come back down to get my bag. So accommodating & I was very comfortable as a single female traveler in this facility. This is now \"my\" hotel in NYC!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:35:16.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
