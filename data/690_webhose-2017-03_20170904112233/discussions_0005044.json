The cliff-top location overlooking a wide bay (where whales can be seen at some times of year) and harbour was stunning. The surroundings are plush, lovely gardens and terraces, fabulous spa; the staff are discreetly attentive, the food is delicious, service is excellent and the rooms are opulent. A nice touch was the free bottle of wine in the room when we arrived and the complimentary items in the mini-bar. These were much appreciated after a long journey.\nAnother pleasant experience was the presence of the hotel's general manager in the restaurants, talking to the guests and even serving coffee. In general, the management staff were very visible and we felt that they were making a big effort to listen to their guests.\nI would definitely go back to this hotel; it was worth every penny and I left there feeling happy and relaxed. The bed was huge and really comfortable and the bathroom was fitted out to an extremely high standard (slipper bath, huge shower, his and hers basins, luxurious toiletries.)\nRoom Tip: We had a room with a private terrace overlooking the pool. It was lovely. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:25:35.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
