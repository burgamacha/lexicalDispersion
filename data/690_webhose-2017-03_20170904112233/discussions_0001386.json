Then start to enjoy being in the Big Apple! Great location for all there is to see and do in New York-- walk to Central Park, stroll Fifth Avenue, walk (it's faster than a cab) to the theater district... it's hard to beat this location.\nStaff is friendly and responsive. Rooms are functional, not overly fancy but clean and modern. The entire hotel is new (2013) and furnished to show off the newness. No antiques here. Street noise was minimal (on 57th!). Would definitely return.\nRoom Tip: can't beat the \"free\" parking!
