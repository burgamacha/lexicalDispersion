Especially Phillip (unsure of how he spells it), he was so nice, attentive, helpful, and accommodating. From our check in to check out he helped us along the way in finding restaurants, how to get to certain places, and with any minor hotel needs. I've never actively thought to write a review for a hotel before until now! Everyone else was just as great, from the breakfast servers remembering what we liked to have, to the other front desk staff letting us know of any missed calls or room updates. The rooms are a bit small but they are very clean and well decorated and fit my sister and I just fine. Bathroom were also very clean and the shower head was great! The 2 minute walk to the Trocadero center and metro made the hotel even better than it already was. This was our second stay at this hotel and we would be happy to be able to stay again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:47:20.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
