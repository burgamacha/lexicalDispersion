The location is perfect it is literally 30 second walk to the Spanish steps. We had a Junior suite which was very large for a European hotel room, it had a king bed and a couch, definitely an anomaly in Europe. We could see the Spanish steps from our window, admittedly you had to hang out the window but minor detail really! The thing that I really loved about this hotel and I know it is probably really small but it had a kettle in the room. I like to have a cup of tea in the mornings or when I come home from a day of sightseeing and not many European hotels have kettles so you can imagine I was pretty happy.\nThe hotel has a lovely little terrace you can have breakfast and drinks in the afternoon/evening. The breakfast was good with loads of options. Not a full buffet but enough variety to give you a good start to the day.\nThe staff could not do enough for you, they were amazing.The hotel has a list of recommended some restaurants that were lovely, in addition they were also and more than happy to make reservations for us at places we had been recommended.\nI would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:20:50.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
