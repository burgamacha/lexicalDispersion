Well, it was really good. Upgraded to an Executive room with breakfast for Â£74/night. An absolute bargain. Reception were superb, breakfast was very good, location -well I liked it close to Aldgate East and the bottom of Brick Lane. Room was very good with ample room, warm, very quiet. I would go here again.\nThe only thing I could not get away with was the regular knock from the pipes, drip or whatever. However I have told them of this and hopefully they fix it before we go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:47:14.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
