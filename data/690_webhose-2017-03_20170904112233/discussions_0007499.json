The staff were excellent in every department and the breakfast was superb (even though I'm not a fan of buffet breakfast). Room was really clean and tidy, the previous occupant had half eaten a couple of items from the mini bar and replaced the leftovers but the hotel sorted this ready quickly. Nice bar area, we ate out so can't comment on the Pan Asian restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:58:53.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
