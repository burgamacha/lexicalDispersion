We've done some family vacations in New York City, so he knew what he wanted. Eventually he (we) settled on New York City, specifically Manhattan, meaning as close to Times Square as possible. After looking at a number of Hilton properties, I selected one closer to Central Park before realizing it put us out of walking distance to Rockefeller Center. Fortunately Hilton Honors was willing to credit that nonrefundable stay toward the Hilton Garden Inn on 8th and 48/49th street. It couldn't get any better than that. The 50th Street subway is literally around the corner. The center of Times Square is two blocks away. We reserved a corner king room with pull out bed for $10 a night more than a regular room and it was fantastic. It overlooked 8th Ave and looked right down into Times Square. At the end of a long touristy day coming back to the room was like having our own private lounge opening on to Times Square. It was by far the best value for the money of any properties around Times Square and the corner rooms are worth every penny\nThe desk staff are efficient and helpful checking you in and out but they are clueless about the surroundings g neighborhood. I asked for the best Deli within walking distance and was routinely directed to the diner across the street, which does appear to be a good diner, but it is not a deli. Pointing out that fact, the desk staff (more than one person on different times) pointed out that there was some sort of a grocery/Deli across the street. Yes, I could see that myself from the lobby. But what is the best Deli within walking distance? They had no idea. After much personal expiration I determined there are no authentic delis within walking distance, so just go to the grocery/Deli across the street.\nOtherwise the hotel was perfect. Great central Location. Nice rooms. We were on the 12th floor so we didn't hear much noise from the street. All things considered we were very happy.\nThere is a Pick a Bagel location on about 53rd, an easy walk, but it's the same bagels and Boar's Head brand meet and generic lox as you can get at your local grocery store. Just go to the Deli across the street and plan a special trip into the Village to eat at Katz. With the demise of the Carnegie Del there isn't much left in Manhattan. John's Pizza is the choice for pizza, hands down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:43:54.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
