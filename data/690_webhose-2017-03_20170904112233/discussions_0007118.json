The staff were very attentive. My room and bathroom were a great size. The whole place is beautiful! I did not get to try the restaurants, but did order room service. It was your average room service breakfast, but it did arrive hot so that's a bonus. I also liked the location. It's very close to major subway lines and Tribeca and Battery Park are an easy walk away. There are just two things to note...1) The restaurant on the ground floor is very popular and the noise travels straight up the atrium to the rooms above. So if you'd like to be sleeping at midnight ask for a room that's not right off the atrium. 2) There is construction going on outside the hotel. Definitely not The Beekman's fault, but at 9:15 am on a Sunday I had a jackhammer drilling outside my window. When you're checking in I suggest asking the front desk for a room away from the outside construction!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:43:56.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
