Very close to a metro station and near to the Forbidden City. Mark is the best host ever! he's so kind and attentive, always with a smile to receive us after a long day walking in Beijing! He provided us with a lot of helpful tips. The hotel is wonderful, we really feel like having a chinese experience, the courtyard was unique and there is a nice rooftop terrace. The room was excellent, good bed and hot shower. The breakfast is delicious, an excellent homemade jam and a good coffee. Everything clean, quiet and confortable. There is a fridge with drinks and snacks in a fair price, very good. I'm still dreaming about this place, we loved the time we spent in Kell's and we are excited to meet Mark again, someday!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:44:38.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
