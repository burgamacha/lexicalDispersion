I cannot imagine a better location in Rome. Get a deluxe room with view. It's more expensive but that is what makes this hotel extra special. It is so fun to be able to look out the window and see the Piazza in front of the Panthéon with all the people and musicians. Not to mention the Panthéon itself. Everything is within walking distance. The staff is extra friendly and nice. We went up to the rooftop which is closed for drinks in March, but you can still go up and enjoy the view which is spectacular. Breakfast is okay but coffee and fresh squeezed juice were great which is most important. The only criticism I have is that mattress feels worn out. My husband is heavy and he did not like the bed. It felt okay to me. Sheets and pillows are wonderful. The whole experience was amazing. We stayed in room 32. It was a corner room. Highly recommend this room and this hotel!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:17:27.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
