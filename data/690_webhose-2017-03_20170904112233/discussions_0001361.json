Great location. Walking distance to Times Square, and the subway is just steps away. Our car arrived within 10mins of us requesting it. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Concierge was helpful. Wait staff and housekeeping were very nice. Breakfast was decent... I especially like the option to grab & go with takeout container. Rooms were clean and updated.\nThere are three elevators but they were often slow and are VERY small. Sometimes when it finally shows up, you can't fit in it. One elevator was dedicated to taking people to the rooftop bar in the evening which slowed down the service even more.\nOnly other challenge was that we were charged for 2 days parking. In the past, some hotels won't charge for 48hrs of parking if you don't actually stay 48hrs. In this case, we were charged even though we checked out after 44hrs. Not a deal-breaker but a nice gesture when it's not charged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:56:26.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
