It was BETTER than the best review! I emailed the week we were to arrive to say it was our anniversary. Upon check-in we were greeted with Happy Anniversary and an upgrade to the 26th floor (top) with a view of the city. The room was large and comfortable with robes, safe, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, hairdryer. The following night when we got back in there was dessert and anniversary wishes. It was so yummy! The doorman and staff were pleasant, helpful, friendly. Suffice it to say we will return and we highly recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:38:36.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
