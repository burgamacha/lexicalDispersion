Rooms are large, well laid out and contemporary. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was extensive with a wide range of western and oriental foods available.\nWhilst we were there (Aug 2016) there was extensive building work going on at night replacing the pavement outside the hotel. This was outside the control of the hotel and they moved us to quieter rooms when we asked.\nSo overall a very nice friendly, well-appointed hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:59:31.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
