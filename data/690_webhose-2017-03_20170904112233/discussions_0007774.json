The hotel is centrally located on a quite Hutong within a 40 minute walk to the Forbidden City. We choose the Wall to Wall package and had a wonderful experience. The package included a full day of hiking at the Great Wall. The hotel packed us lunches for the day and allowed us to spend the entire day on our own exploring. Also included was a very diverse breakfast every morning along with a three course meal one evening. The restaurant always had at least one employee in the restaurant who could speak english and answer questions. The airport pick up and return was very convenient. The lobby staff was always responsive and helpful when asked for assistance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:36:51.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
