The hotel was lovely and clean and our room was amazing, I upgraded us to the king room and it was well worth it! I've even searched the pillows they use as I need to get them for at home! We were on the 31st floor which is near the top, the view was incredible! We didn't eat at the hotel as we were out all the time. The main thing which stood out to me staying at the Novotel was that I spread balloon and confetti all over the bed for my partners birthday and the cleaners left it there but also left us a voice mail on the phone saying they didn't want to disturb things but would be willing to come and clean at any time if we called. I can't say much more than perfect hotel! I would defiantly stay here again if I go back to NYC. Only 1 negative thing was there is a small daily fee which you won't know about until you check out, it's around $11 per day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:11:09.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
