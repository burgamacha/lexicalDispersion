Great room in terms of comfort and amenities, shower was perfect (big plus in my book) and you could not hear a sound from either outside or from within the hotel.\nBreakfast was typical french, did the trick and the waitress was super friendly and spoke no english (which was as it should be in France :) )\nGreat night sleep, super location, and in terms of value was good (for Paris). This is not a luxury hotel, just a decent place to have you base in this wonderful city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:49:42.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
