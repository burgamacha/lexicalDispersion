The venue was really nice, we were sat in the conservatory area, and the staff were so friendly and helpful, especially Marius the Restaurant Supervisor.\nThe food was great, we had the standard sandwiches followed by chocolate scones & raisin scones and finished with some themed treats including a white chocolate golden egg & blueberry macaroon :) We were offered free refills on sandwiches & cakes, so we ended up with a box to take home as we couldn't finish them all!\nMy sister happened to mention it was my birthday and so at the end of the meal 4 of the staff brought over a cupcake with a candle & sang happy birthday to me. Marius then presented me with a red carnation!\nOverall it was a really nice afternoon and we would definitely recommend this tea.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T11:57:45.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
