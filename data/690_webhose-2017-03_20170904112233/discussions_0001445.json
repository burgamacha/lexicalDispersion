All staff we saw very friendly from the rooftop bar to front desk. Who says New Yorkers rarely smile. Quick with any requests. Loved the location, close to Broadway, shopping, eating and drinking places. Beds were sooo comfy. I have hip back problems, usually have to use travel sleep mat. Never needed it, amazing. Would have no hesitation recommending The Archer. Thanks Archer Hotel for being so welcoming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:40:54.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
