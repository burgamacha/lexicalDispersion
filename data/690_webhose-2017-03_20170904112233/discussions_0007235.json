Plenty of supermarkets, cafes and bars nearby.\nThe room was a good size, clean and quiet (ask for a room away from the main street for a bit more peace) Water was a little on the tepid side and the pressure was low so ran slowly, by the time I'd filled the bath the water was cold.\nThe staff were a little flustered when we arrived as the manager had just been taken ill, there didn't seem to be anyone in place to take charge and our welcome was not warm and friendly and we didn't receive the usual relevant info, such as breakfast times etc. On the whole though the staff were accommodating, especially the male members, the females were a little frosty, didn't say good morning when we came down for breakfast or even offer up a smile, the little things that can make a stay in a Hotel more pleasurable.\nI stay in Premier Inns regularly and this one is a little tight on providing tea bags, coffee, sugar, milk etc.in the rooms, I had to keep returning to the reception to ask for more.\nHigh praise to security though, a group of lads were playing loud music in the enclosed area in the middle of the Inn on Saturday night and a member of the team was there instantly and moving them on, thank you for that as they'd woken me up!\nThese are just small niggles though really and I would happily stay at this Premier Inn again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:41:43.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
