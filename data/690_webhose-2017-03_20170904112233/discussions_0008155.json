Part of a French owned chain, the receptionists were both French, spoke good English and could not have been more helpful if they tried. I was given a room on the top (7th) floor, from which I had a view of the Tower of London (room 722). Work asking for this room specifically for the view. The equipment level was high and everything functioned well. Very modern design, huge shower room, lovely bed, and good wifi. The bar on the ground floor is excellent, again friendly staff and plenty of space, with wide screen TV's showing sport. A Novotel that's trying very hard to please which is not always the case\nRoom Tip: Take 722, and if not the top floor with views towards the river See more room tips Green Features: Not that apparent except for the usual towel policy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:52:47.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
