The lobby, restaurant, and rooms are all attractively decorated. The level of service is friendly, efficient, and prompt. The room was comfortable, with a number of nice pluses such as complimentary bottled water, free wifi that works well, nice robes and slippers, nice bathroom amenities, and turn-down service with a complimentary sweet. The location is great as well - within a block or two of two subway lines, around the corner from a great bagel place, and in an attractive and safe part of town. I'm glad I found this hotel, and I will definitely be going back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:53:05.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
