Very comfortable. There is a full kitchen that you share with one other guest ( who we never saw).\nNext door is Whole Foods, so if you wish, stock the fridge with ice cream and smoked salmon and enjoy! The view of Central Park is awesome. The service is great. The only negative, the awful Kuerig coffee makers. There is no coffee in the morning in the lobby. We have come to expect great coffee from a 5 star hotel. We went to Starbucks around the corner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:41:09.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
