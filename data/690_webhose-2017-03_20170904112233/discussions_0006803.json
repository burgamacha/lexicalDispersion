Plenty of pubs and restaurants are close by the hotel. My room had a around 50 inch TV which was a great addition after a day out. Check-in staff were extremely friendly and the breakfast decent.\nDefinitely a good hotel in Mercure standards. The only disappointment was the lack of online check-in and fast check-out which I am used to at Accor properties, hopefully in the future there will be more consistency within the Mercure and other Accor hotels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:17:53.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
