This means that most major sights and attractions are within easy walking distance or if you are not so inclined to walk it is very easy to jump on the Metro. The hotel is right opposite the Opera house which I would highly recommend a tour of. The grandeur and beaut of this building is awesome.\nOur room was a very good size for the middle of Paris, the bathroom was a little cramped though, but we could make do. All public areas of the hotel are very well maintained and the Cafe de la Paix was excellent. All staff were very friendly and helpful.\nWe really enjoyed our stay here, it was great value for money and hope to return again one day.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:25:43.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
