We had 3 nights there 14 to 17 March with my wife and it was 3 nights perfect quiet sleep which is just what you need after a hard day and night visiting various locations in the capital and often don't get at other hotels in the center. They even remembered it was a treat for my wife and sent a card and a small bottle of fizz. Thank you and all your staff, we will see you again later in the year.\nRoom Tip: Just ask for one away from Carlisle street.
