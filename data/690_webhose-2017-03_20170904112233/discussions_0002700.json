Set in the heart of the financial district, it is a quick walk to all of the points of interest in this area. The lobby alone is amazing with it's warm orange marble welcoming you inside. At the check-in, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help. When I opened the door to my room, I was stunned. If anyone is familiar with a majority of NYC hotel rooms, I was expecting a room that was not much bigger than my bed. This was NOT the case here! Not only did I have a king-size bed with 4 feet of space on the sides, there was a large desk are, a living area, a full kitchen area, hallway, large closet area, staging area, and a full bathroom with plenty of space to move around. The decor was very nicely done with touches of whimsy such as an owl figure perched high in the bathroom and a chalkboard for writing whatever comes to mind. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying here again.
