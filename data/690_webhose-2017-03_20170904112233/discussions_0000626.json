This hotel is the star example of an exceptional boutique hotel. The decor is homely yet discreetly stylish. Rooms are very comfortable and clean which makes it easy to get a good nights rest. The location is excellent as there is easy access to metro stations and buses nearby with a large selection of cafe's and restaurants. Luxembourg garden is very close and great for a walk or jog. All the famous sight's you would want to visit are either a comfortable hour walk or less then half that by public transport. Finally the service is first class where all the staff are kind, polite and helpful. They really made me feel part of the hotel and this will always be my first choice when visiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:06:41.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
