Hotel Relais Bosquet is one of those quiet little gems that is a block off the wonderful throwback neighborhood that is Rue Cler (and in the shadow of the Efifel Tower). The very helpful, English speaking staff and clean, modern rooms are of the highest order. When one combines all of this with easy Line 8 subway access at Ecole Militaire, it makes it very easy to get around Paris. A hotel stay doesn't get much better than this. My wife and I stayed here in 2000 for our 10 wedding anniversary, and came again this week with my business partners. The gentlemen at the front desk helped us in 2000 and again in 2017. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\nRoom Tip: The upper floors, above the street, are very nice and quiet.
