Location is absolutely perfect! We walked almost everywhere without a problem. The area surrounding the hotel has tons of restaurants and shops and is quintessentially Parisian. We didn't find the room to be that small, but we are used to the sizes of rooms typically found in cities. Compared to rooms in NYC hotels I would say the size is above average. The staff is lovely and very helpful. Sanjay and Edgar were absolutely wonderful and we especially liked Sebastian who we saw regularly at the front desk. The only issue we had is that the taxi we took to the airport at the end charged us 65â‚¬, where we have been told the standard is a set 55 (we paid 55 coming from the airport at the beginning of the trip and that drive took nearly double the amount of time) plus the driver directly asked us for a tip. We would have tipped him nonetheless, but there is a difference between graciously accepting a tip and asking for one. Obviously this is not the hotel's fault, but I'd advise you to inquire about this if you have them book you a taxi. Aside from that minor issue we had a fabulous time and we hope to stay at Hotel de Buci again on our next trip to Paris!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:36:40.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
