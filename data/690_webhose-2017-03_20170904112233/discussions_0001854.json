Wonderful staff, fantastic facilities, comfortable rooms, great location and well priced.\nWe stayed here twice for 7 days.\nThe food is also excellent and well priced. To be honest we couldn't find a better deal in Rome.\nI would definitely stay here again. We stayed in other hotels in Italy but this was our favourite. Highly recommended. Thank you to the staff at iQ Hotel Roma for your friendly welcome to us and for always being very helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:47:38.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
