However, the quality of the hotel, the service standard, amenities and size of the room are the best value for money I have ever come across. The customer service was simply outstanding, particularly the attentiveness of the hotel manager, Luca. After a small hiccup with our reservation, Luca came to our rescue and not only resolved the issue quickly, but provided us with a bottle of wine and a handwritten card to apologise for any inconvenience. Throughout our stay he always acknowledged us by name and was genuinely interested in ensuring our stay was the best possible. The breakfast is great, as is the lovely lounge area where free tea and coffee are available throughout the day and night. The rooms are large and spacious, and it was great to have a fully equipped kitchenette to cook meals if you so desired. There is also a Nespresso machine and 4 pods in each room. You must buy any extra pods but that was fine.\nDo yourself a favour, and come and relax here. It really is a home away from home and we will certainly be back. Thanks Luca and the wonderful team at Staybridge Suites Vauxhall.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:02:53.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
