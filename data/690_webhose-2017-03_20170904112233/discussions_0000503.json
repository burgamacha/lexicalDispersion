The room was really lovely with an extremely comfortable bed, balcony with a view of the vineyard and a nice bathroom with free-standing tub. The breakfast was very tasty with a nice selection of hot food and good breads. We had our breakfast each day on a really pretty patio. The bar was nice but a bit dead the night we sat there. The service was excellent here throughout our stay. We got a private tour to some of the vineyards through the hotel but we would recommend just getting an Uber between each of the vineyards as you can take your time and then go to whichever ones you want. It's also easy to get an Uber into town. We followed the walking trails around the grounds each day as they gave us a decent workout which was well needed given the amount of eating and drinking one does in stellenbosch. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Also, we actually got an Uber here from Cape Town as we had trouble with our hire car. In the end it worked out to be a happy accident as we didn't need the car at all so it was cheaper and less hassle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:34:04.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
