But when it came to rest my head ( that's why we picked this place ) the pillows were like sleeping on clouds, the bed was very comfortable you do get a wardrobe for a few items and 3 draws for your smalls 10 coat hangers but i put my jumpers and t-shirts in there. The safe had a low battery warning on it and this was fixed with in 5 minuets of the phone call being made. On another day the tv decided not to turn its self off with the power button on the remote, but one call down stairs to tell them about the fault and the maintenance guy was knocking my door to fix the problem. Could not tell you about the restaurant as we did not use it, but PLEASE be careful of scammers at the airport ( JFK ) the suv's look awesome but cost me over $200.00 to get from airport to hotel. Your better off getting a yellow cab. From the hotel to jfk was only $72 using the hotels driver. We had hot running water every day without fail, the shower is good for a wash but will not blow your skin off. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay very welcome, and with professionalism to match. Would i stay there again ! more like cannot wait to go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:11:34.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
