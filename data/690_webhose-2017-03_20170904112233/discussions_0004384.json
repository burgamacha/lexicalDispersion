The operation manager Ms Delphin (sorry if misspelled) and Manager Mr La Ru were very efficient and moved us to an upgraded room.\nSeems was a cable tv problem.\nThe Marriot App which I used to check in did not notify the hotel system .\nExecutive lounge small with no snacks or fruit in non peak hours but drinks only. Marriot Rive Gauche is nicer larger more variety plus free magazines newspapers.\nBreakfast brunch near lobby was as usual good quality.\nBeds as usual very comfortable as well as the shower.\nAlthough the hotel has some problems compared to other Marriot or Renaissance in Paris (Rive Gauche or Arc de Triomphe) especially as it much older the location is fantastic and the managers and staff friendly and efficient.\nBeware when buying tickets for Louis Vuitton Foundation - the concierge did not inform us when selling us tickets for 25â‚¬ (5 euros more then at the location) that there was no exhibition taking place that week!! The tickets are worth extra cost only if exhibition as you save time lining up . During non exhibition times no lines and there is only tour of the building (for that tour no line and ticket is 1/2 price at the location)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:12:58.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
