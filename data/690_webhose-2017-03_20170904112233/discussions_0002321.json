We arrived from airport Charles-de-Gaulle by Riossybus. I think it is more comfortable then by RER. Hotel is very small, but cozy. We were stay there 3 nights. The room cleaned every day, towels changed every day too. The staff always helped, then we asked. I think, it is a good place to stay in Paris and not expensive. Only good emotions and impressions from this hotel and Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:05:34.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
