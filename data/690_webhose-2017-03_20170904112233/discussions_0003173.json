We were welcomed to check-in a bit early as our train arrived well before the regular check-in time and he was able to give us some good advice on navigating the city. They do a great job of securing the hotel by controlling card keys and the inflow of people into the location. Being in a foreign environment, it was very nice to feel the extra bit of effort in regards to safety.\nThe standard room itself was very quaint but functional. For a few days in Paris, it was perfect. The bathroom was actually surprisingly large and the hot water/pressure was good.\nThe location was phenomenal, just a few blocks from the Eiffel Tower with plenty of good dining spots close by. I highly recommend Gloria. The Mus√©e du Quai Branly Metro stop is just a short walk which can get you to Versailles or anything along the Seine very quickly. Furthermore, walking around the 7th felt particularly safe given the amount of foot traffic there was at night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:45:51.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
