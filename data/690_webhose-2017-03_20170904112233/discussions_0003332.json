Should have cost us 12 Euros to get to hotel but, unfortunately, the metro was closed down for the day (still unsure why) so, 50 Euros later and a scary taxi ride!!! arrived at hotel.\nFirst impression - lovely, clean hotel but no staff in foyer for at least 10 minutes.\nRoom (on 6th floor) very clean but not a great view. Very noisy if you open the window but Paris is 'loud' so understandable.\nBeds very hard and extremely uncomfortable. Shower good but bath very bouncy - thought it was going to give way. Shower screen useless, floor was soaked. Fridge, kettle, tea, coffee and milk in room but no normal tea and only paper cups!\nBreakfast was good, cereals, bread, cakes, sausage, scrambled egg, boiled eggs, cheese, ham, fruit and bacon available along with hot drinks and juices.\nLocation excellent for the Moullin Rouge show (5 minute walk). This is where we also caught the open top buses, metro and the little train. (Metro - Blanche).\nThis area has plenty of bars and restaurants and 'sex shops'!!!! (Made us laugh!).\nSadly a lot of people (and families) sleeping rough and begging day and night.\nWell lit and crowded. Never made to feel uncomfortable.\nUltimately a great hotel to base yourself at if you want to tour Paris. We saw everything in 2 days!\nRoom Tip: Higher floors probably have the best views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:50:37.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
