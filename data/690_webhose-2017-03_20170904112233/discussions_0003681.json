This hotel was up to date, clean, and had great customer service. The hotel grounds were pretty spacious (roof top, lobby, balconies.) Breakfast was really good and had a fair selection on the menu. The rooms could be a little more spacious and it would have been nice to have some more storage areas for our belongings, bathroom was huge, the king size beds were extremely comfortable, and the view from our bed was amazing! Great stay, location, and reasonably priced. I highly recommend staying here if visiting NY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:23:11.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
