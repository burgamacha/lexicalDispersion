The first two nights were interrupted by a heater / air conditioning unit that despite the 'off' switch was impossible to completely turn off. It stayed off for about an hour and then came back on again waking me up. I complained, their 'tech guy' looked into it, 'fixed it', except he hadn't! If I'd stayed for 2 nights my review would have been 1 star, despite the clean room, great bed and linen, good bathroom. By the third night I was exhausted and slept through the noise. My complaint the second night resulted in a complimentary breakfast which was actually very good.\nThe last two nights were a different experience thanks to Elizabeth on reception. There was another room now available and she had no hesitation in being able to transfer me to another room. This room was much better. The heater / air conditioning unit, which was a little older and by a different manufacturer (sorry, I cannot remember the brand) had an off switch that worked - it stayed off! Also the window actually has a street view as opposed to the other room's 'window' which was frosted glass!! And I had another breakfast which was very good (I paid this time!).\nSo you can (eventually!) have a great stay here. And again a big thanks to Elizabeth, and Christal on reception.\nRoom Tip: The hotel is in a side street with virtually no traffic noise so I imagine all rooms can be quiet.
