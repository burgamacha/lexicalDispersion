It is super well located and the rooms are very comfy, well designed and super clean. But the best of the hotel is by far the service. They have been so helpful to recommend restaurant, to organise taxis in the middle of a strike and the best of all Alfiero for having fixed to find my coat back and get it delivered at my meeting place. All was organised to the minute and made us feel like super stars!!!! A million thanks , we will be back!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:35:46.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
