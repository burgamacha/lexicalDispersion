Its location near Termini was perfect for that purpose!\nThe rooms are small, but perfectly clean and modern. The wifi is good and the bed is comfortable.\nAs other reviewers have noted, the staff is very professional. David helped us with check-in, taxi reservation for the next day, loaning us an additional electrical adapter, and pointing us in the direction of a simple restaurant for dinner.\nI certainly would recommend it :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:44:15.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
