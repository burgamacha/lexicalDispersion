We elected this hotel because it is in a nice location, I am a Marriott member, and it just off the hustle and constant bustle of Times Square. We got in at 1:00 am after a long travel day. Paulina welcomed us with a bright smile and was so kind. As an Elite member, I asked for an upgrade. Unfortunately, there was a business conference and there wasn't an upgrade available, but she told me to stop back the next day and she'd work something out-and, thankfully, she kept that promise. We got a very nice corner room for the last several nights of our stay. She also made us feel very special every time we saw her.\nThe concierge lounge was great for our family for breakfast. Lots of great options and very delicious. We also stopped up a time or two for happy hour/apps before dinner. It was nice to be able to grab an apple and some waters to snack on throughout our busy tourist days. The concierge, Margaret, was very helpful - she helped us several times.\nThanks for the great stay. We loved NYC! I do think if we come back we might choose the Marriott Marquis as we spent a lot of time in that area and with the rainy weather we had most of the week, it would have been nice to be a little more central. But, this hotel was awesome and highly recommended. Paulina was awesome!\nTry the 212 Steakhouse just a few blocks away.
