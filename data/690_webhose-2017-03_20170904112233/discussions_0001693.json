We chose the luxury room 101 with its grandeur, exit to terrace and garden and excellent views.\nThere is one sincere downpoint though: the windows and doors of this room are not up to time anymore. Fixation of open windows at night is instable as there often are very strong winds in Hermanus. The door to the garden was rattling until we found out how to stabilize it by wooden blockers. That kept us up half the night though. The young man (Food and Beverages Manager) how showed us the room did not point out this important detail: unforgivable! Otherwise the room 101 is great luxury!\nWe also enjoyed the fine food at the hotel's restaurant.\nRoom Tip: View to the sea is a must.
