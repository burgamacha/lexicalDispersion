I stay here frequently when in London and have never been disappointed. The staff are fabulous. The day manager Andrei in particular is always very accommodating. The rooms are always clean, tidy and very comfortable. They have lovely bath products. The location is excellent.\nAfter living in London for years I can say this is a top quality place at fair price for London standards. Look forward to staying there again this week!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:23:45.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
