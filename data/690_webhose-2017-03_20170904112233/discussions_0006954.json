No thrills but a well equipped single bed room as clean and with the neccesary ammenities in it, that you will expect for a good start. Small but clean bathroom with everything you need as well. We visited the 27th floor on the next day and had a nice complimentary caffe latte from the coffee machine, sat at the terrace with and impressisve view of midtownÂ´s Lexington Avenue. Being this our stay of the vacation trip with my wife, we made use of the laundry room to later pack our freshly washed clothes to continue our trip to our next destination, 5 days later. In the second floor of the hotel, we also could prepare each morning a special water filter and the recipients to fill with well tasting filtered drinking water to take for hidratation on our daily journey of tourism. I will definitely book again a room in Hotel Boutique at Grand Central for my future visits to New York City, be it for tourism or for business. I will also recommend it to my friends that look for a no thrills but well located property with all you need for a pleasant stay in the Big Apple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:04:15.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
