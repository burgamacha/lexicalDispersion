The subway is right in front of the hotel which makes getting to the forbidden city, the summer palace, hou hai area, Hutong tours and downtown all within 10-30 minutes. its practically within walking distance of the temple of heaven and the famous pearl market. The hotel has a variety of room styles. Always opt for the higher class room. The beds are night and day different in the comfort factor and the size of the rooms are much nicer for the nominal increase. Great to walk from the hotel to coffee shops and mall like shopping. Very well lit and very safe to be in this area. Great breakfast too. There is a currency machine in the lobby but don't expect fluent English at the front desk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:48:32.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
