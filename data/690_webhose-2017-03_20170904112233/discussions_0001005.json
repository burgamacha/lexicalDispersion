The hotel even had its own private cinema in the basement with a popcorn machine, we wanted to go but didn't have time\nDidn't go for the breakfast option but good food is never too far away, Rue Montoguriel is less than ten minutes walk away heading towards the Marais region and should be checked out, it’s a pedestrianised and is lined with wonderful eateries, including the Stohrer bakery with amazing éclairs!\nThey offer pastries and tit bits in the hotel from noon to the evening also (this is Paris so bring an appetite!) and it is little pleasant touches such as this that make you feel special.\nHowever the biggest draw are the staff, they are amazingly friendly, always helpful, giving directions and suggestions and spoke a wide range of languages; They are there to look after you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:40:43.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
