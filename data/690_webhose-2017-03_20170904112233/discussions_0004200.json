This hotel is in a superb location, minutes from restaurants and theatres and has an ambience and charm usually only reserved for smaller hotels.\nFrom the minute you walk in to the minute you leave, nothing is too much trouble from the professional and friendly staff. My husband was very unwell during our stay and had to spend most of his weekend around the hotel but the fantastic staff were amazing. We had a free upgraded room which was out of this world, modern, clean and with fabulous amenities. The staff kept an eye on him and bought up refreshments without asking. We used the room service for breakfasts and for a couple of meals and they were bought to us in a timely and professional way and were delicious.\nThe meal in the Terrace restaurant was fabulous too as were the cocktails in the Terrace Bar.\nThe bed was so comfortable and the iPad in the room so useful for checking on things taking place in the hotel or for making meal reservations or express checking out. The mini bar was nicely stocked and the Nespresso machine was a lovely touch.\nThe bathroom was spacious and had everything you could want in it.\nI can't recommend the Amba Hotel, Charing Cross highly enough and definitely would love to return one day.\nIt may only be four stars but I would give it five stars or higher. It's luxury accommodation but with a warm and cosy feel - Wonderful", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:52:42.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
