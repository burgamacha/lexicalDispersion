I never had to wait, not even once (admittedly I doubt they were booked up tho). The place was always clean and the rooms were a beautiful dark wood and had a sink in room. My only complaints were the street noise (which frankly I doubt I could have gotten away from unless I was in a high rise) and the fact that the heater is very efficient. A little too efficient. I slept in my undies and a sheet. The location was super handy with the Union Square subway link just 3 blocks away. Wifi was fine but not super speedy. There is an easy to use safe in the room for your valuables, it fit my 13 inch laptop and case just fine along with all the other electronics etc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:33:57.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
