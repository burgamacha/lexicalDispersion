We arrived at 7am and they are allowed us an early check in and we were very very thankful as we were sadly jet lagged. The hotel is beautiful. Executive Lounge was impressive. Lovely breakfast and enjoyable canap√©s and alcohol in the evening. Breakfast on main level was excellent and all staff incredibly friendly. Located only a 5 minute walk from Big Ben this hotel is a perfect location. We can't wait to return. Thank you so much doubletree. We had a blast. Only downside - rooms are a little small but beds comfy and they appreciate your loyalty as a Diamond member, which doesn't always happen at Hilton hotels.\nRoom Tip: Any room on a higher floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:04:10.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
