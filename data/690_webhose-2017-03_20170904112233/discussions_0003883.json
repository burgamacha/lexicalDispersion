Everyone in the hotel was nice, although during my stay I didn't have to use the concierge service. The room (Queen superior) was outstanding! I was on the 12th floor with a great view (city view is important to me when I'm on vacation), deco was so beautiful, super comfy bed, neat bathroom, I didn't like the TV that much, it didn't work well, remote control didn't work at all, but who needs tv when you're in NYC? The bar was also good for pre drinks, great cocktails and atmosphere, once you step out of the hotel you already feel how busy LES can get at night, there are plenty of bars and restaurants just a few steps away. I'd stay at Sixty LES again! Thank you SIXTY :).\nRoom Tip: high floor, stunning view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:43:30.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
