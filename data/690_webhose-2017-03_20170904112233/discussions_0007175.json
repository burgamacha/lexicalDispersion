Handy concierge in the lobby with non pushy approach to explaining the options for companies they are affiliated too . Room was clean , bed comfy , good shower and no noise from outside . Oh and location wise - perfect for everything , we were either max 20\nmins walk or a few tube stops from pretty much all the major attractions . Also being in the financial district it was quiet when you set foot outside and not instantly manic like further into town . Tube pass $32 for the week , a bargain . Thanks Holiday Inn for providing a great base to explore from .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:26:13.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
