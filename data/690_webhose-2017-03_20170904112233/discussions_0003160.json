The hotel is in a great Chelsea neighborhood, very close to the High Line, Chelsea Market, tons of shops and eateries. It is a remodeled historic building, with high ceilings, tiled bathrooms, thick walls, and high, large windows. There is a lovely front patio and cozy indoor seating area near the coffee bar. We arrived a few hours before check in, and not only were we granted early check in, but our room was upgraded! Comfy beds, free WiFi, clean room, and noon checkout were all things which endeared the hotel to us. This is our new New York hotel from now on!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:01:13.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
