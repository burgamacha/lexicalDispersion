The staff is very friendly. The children were welcomed with little packages. It is a nice little touch. It's very close to the main attractions. There us a mall that is about 10 mins walk from the place. The ladies in the breakfast room were amazing. Victoria and Marina were so warm and caring to the kids, always smiling and ready to help. It felt like being at home. We all felt very special. Thank you for making it a memorable experience for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:11:08.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
