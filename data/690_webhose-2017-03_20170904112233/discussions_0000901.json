In fact, when we returned to London, instead of branching out and trying a new place, we ended up staying at Soho Hotel for a second time. It's super chic, modern, luxurious, and swanky, yet inviting. Our favorite area is the bar/breakfast area. The decor is quite lovely, as is the overall vibe of the place. Additionally, the drinks are incredible (try a bloody mary...best we've ever had) and the food and service are both on point. The location is also fabulous as you're a quick walk to a ton of pubs, and not too far from public transportation. Would definitely recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:21:24.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
