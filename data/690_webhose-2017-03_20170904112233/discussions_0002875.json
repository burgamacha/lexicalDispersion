We were checked I. And received water on arrival. The suite was equipped with full kitchen and very comfortable king bed. The rio also had a sleeper couch but we did not use it. The hotel is near subway and time square. I would highly recommend this hotel. There is also a complementary breakfast which had something for everyone. The coffee, hot chocolate and tea was available all day with fresh baked cookies midday. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the hotel or location I will certainly stay at the hotel again.there is also reasonable parking almost across the street which was very convenient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:24:59.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
