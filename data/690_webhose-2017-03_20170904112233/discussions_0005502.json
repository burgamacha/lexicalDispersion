The one person on duty did offer to help but as he was on his own that would have to be later and we were in a rush. Was not fixed until the next day. I realise these things happen but I think the hotel should have had an extra person on duty in the circumstances. I asked for compensation and we were given a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast itself was very average and the fact that the person on duty was eating was a bit off-putting. Having said all that, the room was clean and comfortable and the location is very good, so overall we were happy with our stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:56:23.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
