Plus, the back side of the hotel has a beautiful park like setting, with an old church, super quiet! A well kept secret in bustling London. The deluxe room with two DOUBLE beds (rare in the U.K.) was well worth the extra money...very comfortable. The staff were wonderful - from the front desk, to the bar staff, and especially AIRES from Engineering. He found out it was my mothers 80th birthday and the next thing we knew cake was sent to the room! A very special stay, would highly recommmend.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on the back side of the hotel, overlooking the garden.
