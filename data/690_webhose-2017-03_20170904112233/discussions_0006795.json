Went through the doors and was greeted by a smiley receptionist who helped me checked in and then helped me to find 3 extra pillows as I do normally sleep with more than just two. As I walked into the room everything was clean, just as I had seen it on the pictures on the app. The tricky part was getting the air con to adjust on the head board led settings but I was able to find the right temperature for me.\nThe hotel room gives you a complimentary 2 bottles of water and free tea and coffee which you have to retrieve from downstairs by the deli area. Free movies on tv...Thank you!\nSince there is no room service, there are plenty of restaurants near by for you to indulge and majority of them are under budget or under a tenner.\nMy breakfast was sorted at 6.30am on Monday morning. I Had a chat with the one of the staff on Sunday night and they were able to sort it out for me. Which was good.\nBreakfast was a toasted sandwich, fruit pot and a juice for me. It was okay would've liked more of a selection on the sandwich. But Monday morning was happy with the cheese sandwich box\nHad a good night sleep and would definitely love coming here to stay again. You don't really hear anyone around. It's really quiet.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:48:38.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
