They have a varity of different rooms with or without bathroom.\nRooms are clean and nice. The bed in our room was ok, but the mattres a little hard. I think it is time to change it.\nThe fine thing is that there is a small kitchenette with the room. Location is only a short walk from Earls Court underground.\nFor a prize of 200 pound it is too expencive, but it is possible to get it cheaper.\nNo view from our room. The staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:10:07.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
