Wish the on-site cafe offered more than breakfast. It would be nice to be able to get a refreshment, either coffee and dessert or cocktail for those who are business travelers. I find the hotel pricing to be all over the place and I can't reliably plan to stay here, either for work or for pleasure. If the pricing was right, this would be my go to hotel.Do NOT bother looking for better priced parking options..Icon garage (Scarlet) on 53rd between 2nd and 3rd does not have reliable discount coupons. Deceptive pricing on signs. Paid $72.00 for less than 24 hours.\nRoom Tip: love the view of the lipstick building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:39:07.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
