The hotel was very accommodating allowing us to stay in the room we had without further issues. The place has a boutique feel to it.\nThe room was clean, quiet, well and recently furnished and with a large enough bathroom to swing the proverbial cat (if that's how you travel).\nWe didn't take breakfast or eat there but there is a restaurant and its location very close to both Gare du Nord and Gare del'Est means that it's very easily accessible by foot and with reasonable eating options nearby.\nIf you're happy to walk, it's generally near to most of the central attractions and if you don't the Metro is very close by.\nVery Happy to recommend this place !\nRoom Tip: Ask for one !
