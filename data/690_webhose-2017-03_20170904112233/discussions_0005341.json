Everything was clean and well maintained. The decorations are typical of W hotels with a bohemian funky atmosphere. Be advised that they have \"water closets\" WC off the bar area which means the men's and woman's bathroom is one room with stalls. Not an ideal situation for a work trip and I'm not comfortable with this setup at all. The odd layout for this hotel consists of check in on the 5th floor and transferring elevators to get out of the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:42:17.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
