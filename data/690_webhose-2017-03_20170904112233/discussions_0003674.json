The staff were really helpful, explaining how the Metro worked and how to get to all of the tourist attractions in the best time possible. The room we stayed in was small but had everything we needed and was clean and comfortable. The lift is hilariously teeny! Would stay here again, it's a 2 minute walk from the nearest metro station so great as a base for a quick trip to fantastic Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:00:28.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
