The hotel is a good base for a trip to New York. There are restaurants and a couple of bars near to it and a McDonald's. we used McDonald's for a quick and reasonable breakfast option. We walked everywhere from the hotel with Times Sq probably a 15-20 min walk away. Central Park is a very short walk from the hotel. The hotel is a little dated but the amenities are what you need and I would definitely stay here again for lower price option in New York.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:47:00.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
