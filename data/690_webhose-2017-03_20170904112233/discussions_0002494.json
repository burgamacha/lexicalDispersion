WOW! WOW! This hotel will not disappoint. First of all, the location is impeccable. Located in the city center of Paris, everything is super close! It is only a short drive or even walk to all the local attractions. The hotel is also super fancy. The beds were extremely comfortable and the design was very attractive. The front desk staff was generally very friendly. Alexander was a gem! If you have the opportunity to purchase a room that offers access to the Executive Lounge, it is a must! I have travelled all over the world, and found this Executive Lounge to be one of the best ones around. There is an impressive free breakfast for all guests with incredible food options. If you go to Paris, you MUST stay at this hotel!!\nRoom Tip: The top floor is very cozy with lovely views!
