Every night walking back to the hotel is a treat with the full view of glittering lighted Eiffel Tower. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful as ever, 4 years ago and today. The room is clean and tidy; the breakfast has sufficient variety without feeling overwhelmed. The neighborhood has a nostalgic Parisian feel, the Italian restaurant and the artisan bakery shop flanking the hotel adds on to its charm . This is definitely my \"Paris\" hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:11:38.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
