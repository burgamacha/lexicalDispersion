The hotel is very closed to Termini station which has very good connection from/to the airport. The area is on the northeast side of the city but at walking distance to most of the tourist attractions, for example, 20 minutes to Fontana di Trevi. Around the area there are also quite a lot of more than average restaurants. The main stop of the many hop-on hop-off buses is also in the next block.\nI was in a Junior suite. The size of the room was adequate with separated space for bedroom and living room. The room had coffee and tea facilities free of charge as well as a small selection of soft drinks in the mini bar also free of charge. The bed was confortable and large. Late at night, sometimes you can hear noises from the street but not too annoying. Regarding the TV, I have never been in a hotel with so many TV channels; more than 500, not exagerating.\nThe breakfast was in the rooftop with great views of some parts of the city. Part of it is convered and part is outdoor. If the weather is good, sitting outside for breakfast can be a nice experience. The food choice was similar to other 4 stars hotels, good but not exceptional. The service in general was very good and attentive.\nThe only \"but\" was the small size of the elevator, big enough only for 4 people with no luggage. This is a very recommended hotel with a very good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:27:07.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
