The staff is, like everyone else is saying, extremely nice and helpful! The rooms are a decent size, you are in mid town Manhattan of course.. the bathroom is big, I would like a normal bath tub but this is the American standard sizing.\nThe tv is great, lots of channels and good quality.\nEverything is really clean and well looked after.\nIt's also very quiet, the heating worked well as it was very cold outside and it didn't even make a lot of noise. I had a nice view on the street side, I do suggest earplugs if you're a light sleeper like me as you will, of course, hear some city noise.\nThe location is awesome, 4 streets from penn station for trains and subways, Times Square 10 min walk, the park is close from there.\nI didn't have breakfast in the hotel, there are a million places around you to have anything your heart desires!\nI got an amazing deal through Booking.com and I would definitely stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:51:40.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
