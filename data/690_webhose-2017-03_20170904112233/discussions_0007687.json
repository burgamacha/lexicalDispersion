You get a lot of value for the money. Its brilliantly located close to Beautiful Hyde Park in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Lots of shops and eateries. Its location to Piccadilly station (5-10 min walk) and the Heathrow Express is also fantastic. We took the Heathrow express to the hotel and back to Heathrow. It was an Awesome 15 min ride. We rode public transportation, tube, DLR, and buses everywhere using our oyster cards. No taxi or car service needed.\nThe hotel had a wonderful continental breakfast, pastries, cheese, cereal, yogurt etc, and full english breakfast each morning. Plenty to eat with a very accommodating staff. This was a huge plus and savings on feeding a family of 4.\nMy girls would have loved to have a pancake option instead of the english breakfast, just for variety, but it is still a lovely morning meal.\nWe booked a quad room. It was actually 2 separate rooms with a shared bath in the middle. Our bedroom had a comfortable queen bed and the 2nd room had 2 twin beds. Both rooms had a nice down comforters. Perfect for our 2 teen daughters to have their own space and us our own space. The room was clean and well equipped with nice big soft towels and plenty of soap, shampoo and body wash. Housekeeping was also good.\n( note...No wash cloths, so pack a few or get them from the front desk for one pound each. This hotel has no air conditioning) The weather was a lovely 55-65 degrees f in the day and 40-45f in the evening, so the No a/c wasn't an issue for our stay. The room also has a safe, a mini fridge and floor fans for your use. Free in room wifi.\nI would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. Its full of charm and the staff is wonderful. Thank You for a Brilliant and Lovely stay. Would stay again.\nFamily from Texas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:51:03.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
