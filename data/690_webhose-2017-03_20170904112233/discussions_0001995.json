My stay at the Hilton was beyond perfect. A friend recommended this hotel to my husband and I and I was not disappointed at all. Upon check in, Sashika was a gem. Her quality of customer service made us feel cared for and valued as Hilton Members. She was informative, funny and very caring. Great characteristics for a manger. Throughout my stay she was attentive and fantastic. She accommodated my every request even when I didn't ask it of her. I will definitely be staying here again and it is because of Sashika. She is a ray of sunlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:23:55.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
