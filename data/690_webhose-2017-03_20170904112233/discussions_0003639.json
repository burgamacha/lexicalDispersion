The views from the room were absolutley amazing and were perfect for our fist trip to New York. The room itself was clean and functional, pillows could be improved on, but the bathroom was lovely with a bath as well as a shower.\nAll of the staff were very friendly and helpful.\nOnly complaint was that my credit card was authorised as soon as we got to the hotel and wasnt told how much was being put on it at the time and it was significantly higher than the cost of the room. No major issue just a slight inconvenience as would have used a different card.\nOverall loved the hotel and would happily go back.\nRoom Tip: High rooms are quieter and have the best views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:16:51.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
