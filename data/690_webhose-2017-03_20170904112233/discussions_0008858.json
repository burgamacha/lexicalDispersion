I booked the suite at the very top , even though my Mum is 80 , she is quite fit so the 4 flights of stairs plus the stairs in the suite were whilst not ideal manageble. The suite was fine although i had not realised that one of the double beds was a sofa bed -I had assumed 2 double beds and 1 single bed meant 2 bedrooms but in fact there was one bedroom with a sofa bed in the lounge area and a single bed in an alcove of the lounge. There were only 3 of us but 3 single people so this meant not as much privacy as expected but it was fine and my single bed was very comfy. What I found odd was the lack of blinds or curtains where the sofa bed was . This meant on the top floor it was light at 6am . Nonetheless it was a charming suite with some views but I did feel like I was in the Aristocats movie in the french eves.\nBreakfast is included in the price and it was delicious with cheeses, yoghurts, croissants and bread plus OJ and coffee. I was disappointed that when we checked in we were not told about the requirement to book a time for breakfast to be delivered and so we did not have any sent up the 1st morning. The arrangements should have been explained to us at check in,\nThe best thing about Hotel St Merry is the location (as well as it's character and looks) it is in the middle of Parisienne nightlife-the bars and restaurants plus the Pompidou Centre is literally round the corner and Notre Dame a 7 minute walk. It is a real experience and I would go back - most certainly for the breakfasts", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:55:36.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
