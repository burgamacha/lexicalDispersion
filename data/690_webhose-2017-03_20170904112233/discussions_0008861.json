The hotel stuck to their guns: Full English was an extra Tenner.\nNow, my understanding of a Continental Breakfast is a couple of flaky croissants, a coffee and a pot of strawberry jam - if you're lucky -the Hotel's is a full buffet featuring juices, a variety of breads, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, fruit etc. On my way into the breakfast room I was so fixated by a 'Full English Breakfast' (vegetarian, of course) that I ignored all this. I have booked again for September and will be having the Continental then.\nOn with the hotel: this is a small (30 odd rooms) 'olde worlde' hotel, perfectly positioned (a 10 minute walk) from The Eventim Apollo and the brilliant vegetarian restaurant: The Gate.\nWe stayed in a 'executive zipped' suite, which was spacious (this is London, for God's sake!) - I repeat - spacious, well-equipped, and oh-so-comfortable. Also, very very quiet; at no time did we hear loos flushing, showers going on and off, or conversation from other rooms.\nBut the nicest aspect of this hotel is the delightful staff: we got back from the concert a little late, fancying a 'night-cap', but the bar was closed; no problem, it was reopened - graciously. Thank you.\nA lovely stay, we are looking forward to September.\nRoom Tip: The suites are very spacious and comfortable.
