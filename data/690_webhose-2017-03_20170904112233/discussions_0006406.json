Easy and good check-in. The bed was a queen bed, we are used to a king but it was a decent size and comfy. I often have issues with pillows, two too high, one not high enough and this was like this for me, I plumped for just one as the more comfy. The room wasn't large, neither was the bathroom, but quite big enough. Clean, well decorated, big TV, good cupboard for clothes and a kitchenette area. There is no restaurant or place to have breakfast but you can order it in. We decided in advance to get some fruit and fruit juice, take it with us and put it in the fridge, so that was our breakfast, which was fine for us.\nVery quiet area, easy to get to Victoria Station or Mayfair with a walk through the park, or St James, Trafalgar Square with a walk down the Mall.\nVery good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:07:33.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
