When I checked in, to my horror, I was informed that I had booked, and paid in advance through Orbitz, for the previous month ( the 10th, 11th, and 12th also fell on a weekend); I was essentially a no-show on the dates I had mistakenly booked. I was stunned and not sure where I was going to stay, worried about shelling out more money, convinced I'd have to turn around and go back to Penn Station, miss my play, etc. But the manager was the essence of kindness. He found me a room, and honored my previous payment. My room was spacious, clean and cozy. The service was wonderful and the location can't be beat. My weekend was magical, thanks to their graciousness. I would, and will, go back again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:35:37.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
