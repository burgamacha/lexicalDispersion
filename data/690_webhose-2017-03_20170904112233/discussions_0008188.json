It was within minutes walk from tube (piccadilly, district, circle, hammersmith & city lines) and bus stations, with plenty of good restaurants nearby. The hotel itself was new, modern, clean and spacious. Breakfast was excellent with many choices. There was even a microwave available 24/7 for guests to use! Special thanks to hotel staff Monica and Menino, who were smiley, friendly, polite and very helpful. We will definitely stay here again in future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:53:15.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
