Le Royal Monceau is a lovely hotel, centrally located, just a few blocks off the Champs Elysée and the Arc de Triomphe with a very kind, friendly, and attentive staff. The Métro options are very close. Rooms are nicely accommodated with modern furnishings and bathrooms. Clarins products in the bathroom. Beds (on the firm side) and pillows are comfortable; bathroom is ample sized and closet space is sufficient. Our room faced an inner courtyard so it was very quiet, though the view was so-so. My only (small) complaints were first that there is limited drawer space for small clothing and other small objects that otherwise just sat on the desk or coffee table. Second, we had the thermostat set to it's lowest setting and still the room was warm (it was unseasonably warm for spring when we were in the city). Happily, the windows opened into the quiet courtyard so we were able to address this problem. Finally, the toilet seat is a strange height. I am 5 feet 6 inches and my feet just barely touched the ground. Nevertheless, I would recommend this hotel without reservation. It is a wonderful place to stay while in this amazing city.\nRoom Tip: While usually not a problem (noise-wise), ask for a room away from the service doors.
