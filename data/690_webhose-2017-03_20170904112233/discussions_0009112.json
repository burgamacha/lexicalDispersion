The place is definitely in need of an update, looking a little old and worn out but... great service, huge rooms, good beds, huuuge bath towels, and an outstanding happy hour (wine, beers, hot hors d'oeuvres, cheese, crackers, veggies and dips, chips, fruit!!!) from 5 to 7 Pm everyday, in a room looking at the park! Subway stations are 5-7 min away, many options to eat around the hotel from high end restaurants to dellis, and places like Whole Foods, where you can buy stuff to make a picnic at the park. You can walk to Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Time Square, 15-25 min away. I'll definitely stay again!\nRoom Tip: If you can afford ask for park view.
