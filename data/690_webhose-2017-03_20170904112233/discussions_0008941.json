The hotel is brilliantly decorated. The food in the restaurant was good, having said that our farewell meal was the same order as the first night and it has to be said wasn't that nice. On the whole a great stay you can be in the centre of Rome in 20 mins with metro 2 mins away.we are planning the same trip next year and will be back.\nThank you\nDes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:04:08.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
