I booked a room with a garden patio, it made a difference having that little bit of extra space.\nI've stayed at the Sanderson before, therefore knew the beds would be amazingly comfortable, and oh boy they were !!. So glad I got a late checkout, well worth the extra snuggle time !. Staff were pleasant and engaging at all times, and if you manage to find The Blind Spot, it's worth spending some time in there !. It can get noisy because of the bar(s) downstairs, that's the only downside. We stayed on the first floor and didn't really get any noise pollution in our room.\nIt's a stone throw from Leicester Square station, about 2-3 min walk. A perfect location for experiencing the buzzing atmosphere of that part of town.\nJust a fabulously comfortable hotel, what more can you ask for when you are treating that special lady in your life !.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:26:01.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
