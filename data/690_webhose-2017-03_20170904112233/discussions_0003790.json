We only had one night there but we loved this hotel and the charming street it's on. We had a twin room looking out to the street. The room was small, but that's to be expected in Paris. The beds were very comfortable and the heat worked fine (important in Feb). The shower was divine. Because it's a pedestrian street, there is no traffic noise, which was very nice. There are a lot of shops & restaurants on the street and it's an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is quite new and very clean.\nThe young man who checked us in was extremely helpful. He went out of his way to get us settled even though we arrived well before check-in time. He also helped us get our bearings with a map, pointing out which buses we could take to various sites if we didn't want to take the Metro.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:49:34.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
