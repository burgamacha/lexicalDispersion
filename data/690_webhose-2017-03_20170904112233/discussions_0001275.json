The staff are extremely friendly and the rooms are comfortable and the beds are s soft.\nThe roof top terrace is beyond belief, it's so beautiful we could have stayed up there forever.\nBreakfast I thought would be your normal toast and cereal but oh no there was waffles, muffins, toast, eggs, sausage, fruit you name it it was there and plenty of it.\nWe arranged a taxi to take us to JFK which was a little late which made us a little nervous but the staff went out of his was, ran into the street and hailed us a taxi to get us there on time. Thanks just brilliant customer service.\nThe only thing I was unaware of was the hotel asks for a holding fee when you check in, in case you break anything. On check out it is released to you but I was told you have to wait about two weeks to get it back.So this I have to wait for.\nWe had a fantastic stay and would really recommend this hotel to all.\nRoom Tip: Ask for the highest floors with city views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:54:42.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
