This happened to be the perfect location. For those who are first timers to Paris, like I was, this hotel is close to the Place d'Italie train station that connects you to any of the Paris main attractions within a 10 minutes ride with no connections. And the Paris Metro is a lot easier to navigate as compared to the London underground. The hotel itself was very clean and quiet, They served excellent continental breakfast and it is close to restaurants and a shopping mall. The staff were all very nice too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:44:01.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
