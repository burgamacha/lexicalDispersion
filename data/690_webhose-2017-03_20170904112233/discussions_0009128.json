Also, excellent service, very friendly reception! Internet is an issue though. Connects and disconnects all the time. Very rich breakfast, all delicious! Its rooms are far better than what you expect to get for a 3 stars category hotel. A huge variety of small cafes and bistros around the hotel, quite expensive though. In general, this hotel made my first visit to Paris quite easier in everything and added a nice memory to my carnet!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:49:13.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
