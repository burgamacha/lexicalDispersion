Located in the interesting part of Montmarte, away from the more tacky parts of the area, it is typically Parisian. There is a small, slow lift; windows that open into the lightwell; and breakfast in the basement but overall it works well and the focus on art and artists gives it an edge over the competition. My single room was small but well designed with a brand new shower room, wall safe, full length mirror, suitcase stand, clock; reading lamp and desk and chair. Service at check in was excellent and I took advantage of their offer to book a restaurant I particularly wanted to visit. The best features are that the rooms are quiet (although birdsong at 5 am was very pleasant); there is free wifi in the room; and free tea/coffee after 3pm. Breakfast is an extra at â‚¬12 or there are plenty of other choices at the end of the street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:06:38.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
