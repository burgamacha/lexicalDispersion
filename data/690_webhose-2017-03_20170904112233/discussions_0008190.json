The location of the hotel is great for this as it's only a 10-15 minute walk away. Rooms on the higher floors also provide stunning views of the surrounding area and London (although the sun shining on the windows did show lots of grime!) The breakfast was good value for money and the restaurant was pleasant to eat in for a budget hotel. Will definitely stay again when going to the Apollo!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:02:16.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
