Located half a block off of Times Square, it's a really cute boutique hotel. The room was small but very clean with a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast is also included in the price!\nThe service here was great. We arrived early in the morning and was able to store our luggage. The luggage room was secure and had an attendant so I felt that we could leave our valuables instead of carrying it us around the city. There is also coffee at all times and we were able to fill our water bottles with filtered water from the small gym.\nI would definitely stay here the next time I travel to NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:17:40.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
