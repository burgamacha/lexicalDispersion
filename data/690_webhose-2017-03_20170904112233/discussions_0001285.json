It all starts with a welcome back from Derek at the door. Kirk and Franceso happily take care of the luggage! At the front desk, Jason, Victoria, Vanessa, and Tyler make check-in a very pleasurable experience! Trust me, if you only stay here once you will get to know their names! They treat you like family! As for the hotel, great location within walking distance of Times and Herald Squares as well as Penn Station. Try anyone of the three restaurants adjacent to the lobby. My favorite is L'Amico! The rooms on the higher floors have beautiful views of the city skyline. If you have ever stayed at a Kimpton before or if this is your first time, you will not be disappointed!\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing east have nice view of Empire State Building.
