It is very well located being less than 5 minutes walk from the Gare du Nord station. There is a metro station nearby too, so it is easy to travel around Paris.\nOur room was modest in size but perfectly adequate. It was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was small but, again adequate,and it had a very good shower (better than we have had in some 5 star hotels). The bed was very comfortable. The only problem we had was that we found the room to be rather warm despite turning off the radiator and opening the window.\nThe staff on reception were excellent, being both efficient and friendly.\nWi-Fi was good with plenty of sockets both in the bedrooms and reception.\nWe didn't eat at the hotel so I'm unable to comment on the food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:18:41.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
