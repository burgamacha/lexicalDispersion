We booked this hotel for the location near Times Square and because it had a kitchen in the room. The bathroom was very modern and the shower was excellent. The room was clean and the kitchen even had a dishwasher. The room was a bit small with my partner having to negotiate his way past the air conditioning unit to get to bed. The free breakfast was great with a different hot meal everyday. On Monday to Thursday the hotel offered a snack and drink free of charge from 5.30 to 7pm . I would return to the hotel if I ever went back to New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:30:58.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
