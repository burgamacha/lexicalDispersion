Often, I stay in the 6th, so I do not know this neighborhood or the hotels. This choice was great--within a few blocks of the train station--and on a quieter side street. Well, being August, it was pretty quiet around that area, even on a weekday.\nIt's in one of those late 19th or early 20th century buildings that was modernized. The service was competent. The lobby is small, and the room was small, fine for one night for a single person. But it did have high ceilings, and I had a great view looking down over the street. My rating relies on the hotel's value.\nThey have a breakfast room, but I had breakfast outside at a cafe down the street, the Duc de Richelieu, which is also a wine bar. There are plenty of restaurants nearby--a good one is A la Biche au Bois, which I have been to a few years ago. Classic bistro food specializing in game and still has great reviews on this site and others.\nIf you want a walk nearby, go up to the Viaduct des Arts and window shop, or walk along the gardens above, which were still lovely in August.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:02:39.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
