It's a small boutique hotel at St. Germain area with a nice sitting/lobby/breakfast area in the middle of the hotel. All the staffs there are very friendly, helpful and polite.\nYou can find tons of beautiful cafés, fantastic restaurants and high-end boutiques around this area. Le Bon Marche, Rue de Sevres, Louvré are walking distance from this hotel.\nThe room is not super big, but it's enough for 2 persons and it's very clean. Overall, we're pretty satisfied with this hotel. Definitely a hidden gem in St. Germain and we will come back and stay with them if we ever come back to Paris for a weekend gateway :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:47:04.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
