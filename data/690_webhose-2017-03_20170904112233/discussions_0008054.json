Namita in bookings was brilliant in helping with our bookings and on arrival I have nothing but praise for Nate who swiftly upgraded our rooms when one wasn't what we had booked.\nThe hotel is located literally on top of Victoria station so is perfect for people to quickly jump on the tube, 5 min walk from Buckingham palace so is great for a quick visit to the queen. The good was excellent, the rooms were cosy and comfortable, nothing was too much trouble.\nOur only gripe was the amount of beggars you would get hassling you outside on an evening, there should be security outside at night so travellers don't feel so vulnerable.\nOutstanding hotel and staff, great location....would definitely book again. Thanks for a great stay in London xx", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:36:06.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
