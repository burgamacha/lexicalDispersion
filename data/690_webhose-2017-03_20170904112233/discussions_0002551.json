Can't knock the location, we were given a room over reception with views over Grand Street and the Ferrara Bakery.\nThe rooms are very small, but we still managed enough space for our large cases. Yes the bathrooms are open which is awkward but bearable if you are travelling with a partner. The showers are fabulous, great pressure and nice and hot.\nOff the small lobby is a small kitchenette where you can make yourself a hot drink and where they serve the Ferrera pastries in the morning. The hot chocolate was yummy, and appreciated on a cold day, but we got out coffees from Two Hands around the corner on Mott Street.\nLoses points for having nowhere to hang up towels, and only getting two towels a day. I left an extra tip and asked for extra towels but still didn't get any. Sometimes nice to have a shower in the morning and again at the end of a busy (and sometimes freezing) day sightseeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:35:51.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
