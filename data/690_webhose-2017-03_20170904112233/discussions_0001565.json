I can imagine this is because of the charming variety of shops - food, clothes, antiques, wine, droguerie, boulangerie; restaurants, cafes, tea rooms and bars; artisans - bookbinders, rush seat repairers etc etc.\nThe Hotel Belle Juliette is rather in the same vein. It is wonderfully and colourfully decorated and furnished with a very eclectic mix of the old and the new, in a handsome C18 building with a beautiful staircase (&lift). The delicious buffet breakfast with a wide choice is available in one of the salons and in a sort of conservatory overlooking the terrace an communal gardens. attractive even in February.\nOur compact bedroom overlooked the street and was very characterfully and cleverly designed to maximise the space. All was spotlessly clean.\nAfter a day walking the streets of paris we loved having a dip in the beautiful little pool.\nIn addition, the young women on reception were delightful - naturally charming and endlessly helpful.\nRoom Tip: The smallest rooms are pretty compact. Ok for a short stay. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:07:34.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
