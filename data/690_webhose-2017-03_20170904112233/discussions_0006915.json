This was my first experience at this location and everyone I encountered was genuinely helpful, gracious and friendly. Regardless of the time of day or how busy they were. The staff brought the comfort of home to this stranger in a strange land. From the desk clerks (at all hours), the doorman and concierge.\nThe rooms are very accommodating and comfortable; I had no problem with street noise as you might expect from being in the heart of Manhattan. The location was ideal, with Starbucks right around the corner, two convenience stores within a block and restaurants at every turn. I didn't notice early enough but you can also order groceries to be delivered to your room when you can't take the time to go out and eat. Lastly, don't overlook the microwave popcorn with the coffee and tea!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:03:17.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
