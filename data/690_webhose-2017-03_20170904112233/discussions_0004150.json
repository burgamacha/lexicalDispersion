CLOSE to subway, Penn station,Macy's. A good walk to Central Park, an easier walk to theatres. The hotel is small but we'll fitted out. Virtually a new hotel. The room was small, but we were not entertaining.\nBed was very comfortable, excellent WiFi reception.\nWorkout room small, but useful. The bar is comfortable (too cold for the patio), full at happy hour.\nComplementary breakfast was very good, a mix of hot and cold.\nIf the room had been larger I would have given 5 stars. We will stay here again. My wife loved the location. Lots of restaurants close by.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:52:48.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
