For 4 people in a room was tight. A dresser would have been more helpful then the desk.\nNice breakfast, which was great it was included, again just a tight space. The hotel has a couple extras like cookies in the afternoon, and fresh lemon water, and coffee tea and got chocolate free and available all day and night. Super nice after walking around in the cold all day!\nStaff was friendly.\nLocation was good, close to theatres and time square. Remember you are in NYC to walk so bring comfy shoes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:42:19.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
