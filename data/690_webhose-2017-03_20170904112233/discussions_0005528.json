Staff is top notch, location can't be beat, front reception folks are always friendly and greet you each time you pass by. I don't remember the name of the young man at the reception who got us a cab early morning 4:45 am for the ride to St Pancras for the Eurostar. There were no cabs outside the hotel and he ran out to the Strand street and brought the cab back to the front of the hotel. That was exceptional customer service.\nFull stars for the staff and location ideal for sightseeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:53:28.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
