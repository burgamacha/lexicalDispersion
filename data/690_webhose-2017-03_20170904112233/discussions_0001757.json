The location is fantastic, within walking distance of the Musée Rodin, Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower and to some of the best local restaurants in Paris. The rooms are a good size, clean and with very good amenities. I especially like the empty fridge where you can store your shopping. The complimentary coffee and tea, with cakes and canapés, in the lobby is also a very nice touch. The location is perfect as it is in a residential area and the shops and restaurants cater to the locals. There are some amazing cheese shops nearby. The restaurants are all very good and more reasonable than the ones near the tourist centres. There is also a road, five minutes walk away, full of shops selling fresh fish and meats and all sorts of fruits and vegetables as well as cooked foods. The hotel staff were all helpful, friendly and genuinely keen to help. Choose a room on a higher floor as the ground floor rooms can be a bit noisy. I would certainly recommend this hotel. Thank you Mauricio for making our stay so perfect!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:27:24.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
