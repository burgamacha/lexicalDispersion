I wish I could live here, as it has everything you could want. The food is delicious, and I love the Pomme Palais. It has incredible muffins, which my son and I could not wait to enjoy every morning.\nWe have been at this hotel quite often, and I feel like everyone knows who we are, in the best possible way. The staff always has a smile on their face and makes you feel so welcome.\nSusan is my favorite at the front desk, as she is friendly, kind, generous and super-friendly. My 6-year-old son adores her, and she is one of the reasons we like to come back. Anne-Marie is also pretty super and takes wonderful care of us when Susan is not available.\nWe love George at the door, as he also recognizes my son and always is kind and outgoing. The concierge staff is very knowledgeable, helpful, and thorough. I had a pair of pajama bottoms that had a hole in them, and the concierge staff knew exactly where I should go and made sure everything was repaired quickly and perfectly.\nAnd I really feel like people care about you at the hotel. That once you are a part of the Towers guests, you will always be one.\nOur room, whatever size we end up in, is always immaculate, comfortable, and spacious. The Molton Brown amenities are fantastic, and now I use them at home.\nThe food is delicious and always comes on time.\nThank you for another wonderful stay! I look forward to our next stay in New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:21:51.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
