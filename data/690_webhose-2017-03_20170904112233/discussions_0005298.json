We arrived with a reservation on Club Level (the equivalent of a stationary cruise ship!) and were told that we have been upgraded to a Lady Liberty statue-view suite! Our suite was a one and a half bath suite with living room and MBR overlooking Lady Liberty!\nThe offerings in the club were incredible from morning to night. Breakfast included: full array of berries and fresh melons, juices, smoothies, muesli, pastries, NY bagels (YUM!), scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, oatmeal, coffee, tea, cappuccino, espresso, lattes and more! Lunches included: soup, sandwiches, salads, any/every soda/water/wine you'd like and more. Can't comment on dinner type offerings as we ate out but after dinner there were many dessert offerings along with lovely wines.\nThe service at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park is that of the Gold Standard that we have come to love. The location is quiet(er) than Mid-Town Manhattan. A great escape!!!\nSpecial shout out to Emanuel...a Gentleman of the Ritz Carlton Battery Park! Thank you!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:04:49.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
