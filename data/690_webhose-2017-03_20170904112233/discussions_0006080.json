We asked for a quiet room and were duly obliged with no traffic noises being heard at all (no views either of course but what are you going to see anyway!!). The room was smallish (most NYC rooms are) but it was well equipped with a bath/shower, very comfy bed, coffee machine etc etc. Breakfast is included and we dined on waffles, pancakes and doughnuts (not very healthy) every morning and the breakfast \"man\" was absolutely lovely, as were all the staff. There's a gym (we never used it!!), free wi-fi in the rooms and a computer in the lobby. The cleaning staff were also great and there's a handy luggage room were you can safely leave your luggage on your final day. Highly recommended.\nRoom Tip: ask for a quiet room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:24.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
