After sitting at the airport for 6 hours in a plane due to the attack at Orly, we were anxious to get to our hotel and explore Paris. Saad was the wonderful reception desk staff and he helped us so much by suggesting places to eat, where to go, how to get there... This hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, a 20 min. walk to the Champs Elysses and close to a metro station. The room was very comfortable and clean and extremely QUIET. I would recommend Hotel Beaugency to everyone who is traveling to Paris!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:06:21.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
