First and foremost, Sanjay and his staff are truly exceptional. They are caring, warm and go out of their way to make sure their guests are happy. For a first-time visitor in Paris, I truly felt that I was surrounded by friends. The hotel itself is BEAUTIFUL! I enjoyed many quiet moments in my room, looking out onto Rue de Buci. The location could not have been more perfect. I was able to walk nearly everywhere I wanted to go and the hotel is surrounded by tons of cafes and boutique shops. I could not have had a more wonderful stay in Paris and will not stay anywhere else if I return. On my birthday, I was given a bottle of champagne (courtesy of the hotel) and a box of macrons. They truly made me feel very special. THANK YOU SANJAY AND THE REST OF THE STAFF! YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAL!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:51:35.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
