I hadn't ever heard of it, but when it was recommended my my Amex Travel Agent and being part of the Fine Hotels and Resorts, I was in. We had the entire 10th floor to ourselves. Our butler waited anxiously in the hall waiting for something to do. Or room had 2 bedrooms, a dining room, living room, 3 bathrooms, and it was the Penthouse, so we had a circular glass staircase in the corner of the living room leading up to the roof top terrace. Our terrace off of the dining room/living room was also nice, but the rooftop terrace was much better. Not only was it furnished with sofas, chairs, a bar, grass (fake grass of course), but we had a view of Times Square from up top. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and made you feel comfortable, this hotel only has 90 something rooms, as compared to the Hilton in Columbus Circle, which has over 2000 rooms. So we felt special. Everything was in walking distance, and if we didn't feel like walking, to hotel Mercedes would bring us where we wanted to go, for free. I didn't see any of the other rooms so I can't comment on those, but The Producer Suite? (I think that's what it was called) was excellent.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:24:22.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
