Warmly welcomed by all of the staff beginning with he concergie but continued with all other staff we encountered. This friendliness and customer service was not something we found in general in Paris, therefore, was much appreciated. Our room was beautiful. It was warm and had plenty of storage. This hotel is situated in such a fantastic location. We were within walking distance of Notre Dame cathedral and very close to the louvre etc(just across the bridge). The concergie was extremely helpful when we checked in. He gave us a map and explained how to get to the main sites. There are so many cafes and restaurants in Paris and rue du buci is a hub of activity in this regard. Lots of cafes but I would highly recommend Paul's cafe and bakery right across the street from the hotel. The quality of everything we ordered there was superb.\nWould highly recommend this hotel especially for couples.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:52:09.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
