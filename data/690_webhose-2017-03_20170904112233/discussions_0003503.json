The hotel is central to main sites and 5 minute walk to the termini rooms are very clean, it does get hot in the rooms, you can leave your windows open, I had a room facing the back, which was very quiet. The only downside for me would be a lack of a variety of breakfast, don't get me wrong it was filling but would have liked sausages, fried egg on different days, also the shower it was powerful but the way the shower was situated made it harder to manoeuvre. The other downside was the bed, I couldn't get a descent nights sleep, this was due to continuous sitting on the mattress by previous guest which made the mattress slant but overall I would recommend this hotel I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Thank you to all staff at reception and the breakfast room for making us feel welcomed\nRoom Tip: I had a room at the back, quiet on 5th floor.
