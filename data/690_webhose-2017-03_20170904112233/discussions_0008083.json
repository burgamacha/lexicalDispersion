The staff were all very nice, friendly and helpful. The room was so clean, as if it was brand new. Rooms do not have kettles, but you can get hot and cold drinks and snacks next to Reception, where there is a pleasant seating area. I was given a complimentary drink, not sure if this is the custom for all hotel guests, or at the discretion of staff. Next to the hotel is a small cafe which offers 15% off the breakfast food menu for hotel guests. The cafe is open from breakfast time until quite late, so very useful. A notice announced that Tune hotels in London would shortly be rebranded as Point A Hotels. A staff member explained that the new hotels would drop the 'pay for extras' policy and adjust prices accordingly. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Paddington Station, with plenty of shops and places to eat and drink close by. The web site said there could be noise from tube trains which run underneath, I was only conscious of this when on the ground floor. And there was little noise from the street in my room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:22:49.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
