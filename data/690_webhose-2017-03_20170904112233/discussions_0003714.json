At the time of booking we didn't realise it coincided with the Macy day parade. We just walked to the next block from the hotel and watched the parade which was spectacular and made our holiday. The location of the hotel was within walking distance of all the attractions we wanted to see i.e. 5th Avenue, Macys store, Tiffanys, central park and Trump Towers (he had just been elected, but wasn't at home). We also went to ground zero, which involved going on the subway to get there. It was very thought provoking and well worth a visit. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We had a room with a view of the Empire State building which was wonderful. It was lit up at night with lights that changed colours. The bedrooms are on the small side by American standards, but were very comfortable with all amenities expected in a first class hotel. We would definitely book this hotel again when we next visit New York.\nRoom Tip: Go for the higher floors with a view of the Empire state building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:16:54.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
