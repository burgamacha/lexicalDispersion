A lovely, cosy and elegantly decorated room with a beautifully comfortable bed and crisp white linen and just-perfect pillows. The shower was hot and strong and towels were thick and soft.\nAt first I was worried MH was a bit far 'out of the action' but then I realized that Beijing is HUGE and the most important thing is to be near a subway station. MH is an easy 10 minute walk from Jishuitan station which is on circle line 2. The subway is easy to use as there are English signs and ticketing instructions in English. The very friendly reception staff were extremely helpful in planning my day.\nTwo out of three nights I ate at the restaurant around the corner (with the help of Google translate) and it was cheap and tasty.\nBreakfast was fine and importantly, served with a smile.\nI unfortunately fell prey to the 'tea house scam' on my way to visiting the Forbidden City and felt very fragile and teary after that. (I was 'befriended' by two women who started to chat and asked if they could walk with me. They then wanted to stop and have 'tea'. It ended up costing me $80!! I was very gullible but just didn't see it coming and also didn't want to think the worst of people.) It was so nice to come back to a hotel where I felt completely safe and welcome.\nI would highly recommend staying at MH while in Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:26:40.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
