I decided on Hotel Monge based on all the reviews and I was not disappointed! This hotel is located in the Latin Quarter with easy walking access to Notre Dame and St Germain neighborhood. It is on Rue Monge with two different metro stops that gets you to any other areas in Paris. The hotel is on the smaller side with only 6 floors and about 30 rooms, breakfast is served in the lounge daily and there is a 24 hour coffee bar area. Everyone at concierge was so nice and the hotel was very well maintained. The staff really impressed me when my sister left some valuables in the safe and immediately reached out to us to arrange our retrieval of the lost items. The hotel also has a sauna and spa they are renovating. Toiletries are L'Occitane which was a nice bonus! I will definitely use this hotel again when I return to Paris! I was very happy with our stay!\nRoom Tip: Request a higher floor, you can hear the metro less.
