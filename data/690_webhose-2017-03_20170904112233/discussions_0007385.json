The location is excellent... just steps away from London's theatres, and a short 2-3min walk to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.\nThe design of the rooms is very nice, light, and airy. We recommend getting a room with a city view on a higher floor for sure (Floor 6 is the highest).\nSuggestions for improvement: please put coffee / tea machines in the rooms.
