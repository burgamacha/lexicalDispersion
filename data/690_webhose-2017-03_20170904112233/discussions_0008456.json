Breakfast was excellent, the hotel is well situated (opposite Weatherspoons and near The Tower !)and on the final day, we were able to leave our luggage locked away in the foyer until were were ready to leave London.Again staff at reception very friendly and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:55:18.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
