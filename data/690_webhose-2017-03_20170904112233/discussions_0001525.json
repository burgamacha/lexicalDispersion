Our room was very comfortable (larger than the average Paris hotel room) and clean. Having a tub in the bathroom was a big plus. The artistsWe felt we got very good value. Our rate included breakfast, which had something for everyone. Eggs, breakfast meat, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, mueslix, coffees, teas, etc. Personally, I think this is an ideal location. It is out of the main tourist areas so it is less crowded and there are restaurants that cater more to locals. That said, it is easily in reach of all the major attractions. We picked up the on/off Seine tour at the Batobus at Jardin des Plantes stop, approximately a 10 minute walk from the hotel. This gave us access to everything we wanted to visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:00:07.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
