So, I probably have a broader perspective than most.\nThere's a lot to love about about the place. While the hotel is plain and the rooms are tiny... everything is clean and fresh, and the staff is friendly. Plus, the price is generally one of the lowest in the city. As the hotel is a Lutheran mission, there is another an obvious benefit to the traveler: no tax. This may not seem like a big deal until you consider the following.\nNew York State Sales Tax = 4%\nNew York City Sales Tax (4.5%) and Transportation District Surcharge (.375%) = 4.875%\nHotel Room Occupancy Tax = $2 + 5.875%\nAdditional Daily Fee = $1.50\nAlso, located just one east-west block (i.e., long block) from Union Square, not only one of NYC's cooler areas (with lots of great restaurants within a 10 minute walk) but also a major train hub. The following trains pass through the station:\n4, 6, L, N, and Q trains at all times\n5 and R trains at all times except late nights\nW train on weekdays\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal in New York. The hardest part is getting a room, as availability can not be counted upon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:57:22.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
