Couldn't have been more sweet, giving us directions to a function we were attending along with a helpful map, facilitating an early check in. If nothing else had gone right with hotel staff ensured we would have left with a good impression. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and we don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service in where we had breakfast . Food was very good and service attentive and efficient. Room was well equipped and comfortable. We hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:38:31.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
