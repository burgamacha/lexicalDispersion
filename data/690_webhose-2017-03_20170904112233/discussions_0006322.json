Our room was upgraded to a superior river view which was a lovely surprise . When we got to our room on the twelfth floor we had the loveliest surprise , our view of Paris was amazing .Everything was laid out before us , fantastic views of the tower , sacre Coeur and the arc de triomphe . We ate in the cafe on the first night and the food was good if a little expensive , but we were in Paris . The bar had a good selection of drinks that were not too expensive . When we come back to Paris we would stay here again . To sum up it was clean , quiet and only steps away from the metro station .\nRoom Tip: Twelfth floor had great views See more room tips Green Features: Towels were reused , which so often doesn't happen .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:16:02.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
