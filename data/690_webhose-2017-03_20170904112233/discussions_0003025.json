The movie - themed hotel is gorgeous and has everything you could need. The rooms all have windows looking out to gorgeous Paris views and very comfy beds. They even have pastries and tea offered every afternoon. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Lucille helped us from the moment I booked the reservation (I booked a couple details wrong and she helped me get them fixed right away) until we left the hotel. She was wonderful. We missed one of our excursions due to flight changes and when I called the company to reschedule there was a language barrier which made it harder to explain. A gentleman named Merouane at the front desk called for me and spoke to them for over 10 minutes and was able to get me my refund, thank you so much! Also, Boujema helped us multiple times and was so sweet. Thank you all for an amazing time in Paris!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:37:11.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
