Clean rooms, no luxury, but comfortable and clean. Good internet access. The only minus is no trolleys for suitcases or boxes. And since they don't do porters, you are own your own. I thought if they don't have porters, they could at least have luggage trolleys. The only blemish in an other wise nice stay for me. Stay there for two nights. Lovely breakfast. Varied choices, even Haggis! There are two Premier inns on this Road, the other is even closer to the train station, but I think this hotel I stayed in looks bigger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:30:13.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
