Great convenient location. Generally very modern and new decor.\nBuilding material/fixtures aren't very good. They are minor issues though. Eg in my room (209), the two bath towel holders/hooks were quite wobbly. The shower screen isn't big enough and there is no ledge on the rim of the bath, so it's easy for splashes of water to run towards the bathroom floor. One of the USB charging station wasn't working. None of these were big enough issues for me to attempt to switch room.\nBreakfast buffet was ok.\nAmbrosia Restaurant on the roof has great atmosphere with views. However the food was quite disappointing. One of my wife's scallops had an off-taste. Notified the staff, but no reaction to attempt to remedy the poor dish. My fettuccine tastes fine but it certainly wasn't al dente. We ate pasta every day for 10 days while in Italy and this was be poorest pasta of the trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:19:03.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
