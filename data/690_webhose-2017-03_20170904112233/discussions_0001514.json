Really close to the metro. Staff extremely helpful and attentive and i just loved the lay out of the reception area with games and computer facilities. Breakfast had a fair bit of variety it was good quality and there was a lot if it if you wanted that. Local market is just outside on Saturday and Sunday well worth a scout around it. As in all cities just be mindful of who is around you - we never had any issues however. All in all a good spot for a short stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:52:31.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
