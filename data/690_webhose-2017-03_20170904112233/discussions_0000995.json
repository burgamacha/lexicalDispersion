The location was beyond perfect, a short walk to the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, the Tulleries. The area around the hotel was like the upper east side of Manhatten, lovely little boutiques, gorgeous cafes and restaurants. The staff was exemplory. For example they wouldn't let us leave without an umbrella they provided in the lobby in case it rained.\nOur Maitre D'i in the morning provided us with a fabulous breakfast in the beautiful restaurant, which felt like an intimate dining room and doubled as a bar/living area in the afternoons.\nThe mattresses were good, firm and the pillows were lovely, the blackout curtains were excellent. The bathroom was sumptuous. The living room in the suite however left a lot to be desired. I understand the rooms are due for renovation and this would be good. The furniture in the living rooms of the suites are \"classical\", that is not to say, comfortable. Also the wifi went down on our last night and there was no fix.\nWhile I loved our location, the staff and our welcome, the rooms left a lot to be desired. I have no doubt they will update soon, but be aware that you will not have a lovely sitting area to watch TV or relax while a partner is asleep in the very near future..\nThe staff and the beds and location may compensate for this however.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:36:35.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
