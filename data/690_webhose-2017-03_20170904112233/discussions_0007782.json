The location is fabulous and our room had a glimpse of Central Park. Every member of the service team took the time to learn our names and to greet us personally every time we came departed or returned to the hotel. The Star Lounge is a fabulous place to sit and have a drink or a meal. The cocktails are wonderful, the service sublime, and the atmosphere nearly always humming with guests of all ages enjoying themselves. The rooms are flawless - every single thing in the rooms worked perfectly. Our room was remarkably quiet as well. We were on the 14th floor. I highly recommend the Ritz for its professional and congenial personnel and for the beautiful and comfortable rooms and public spaces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:32:36.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
