Having done 5 Star luxury last year for my 50th Birthday, I had anticipated finding it hard not to compare the two. How wrong I was! This is a fantastic Hotel in the heart of a fantastic part of Paris. Small but perfectly formed. My 6ft husband would definately struggle in the shower, but again beautifully clean. Great wi-fi in the room so not bothered by no English TV. Room at the back with no view, but by the time we get back from a day round Paris on foot..who cares! And I couldnt believe how quiet it was, given our central location :-) Great helpful staff, great breakfast and the lift?! Hilarious! I have never seen such a cute lift and quite good fun, reception is lovely so not such a hardship to wait a few moments for the next one. This Hotel gets 5 Stars from me, not for the 5 star luxury surroundings, but for being a superb little, well cared for, well staffed hotel in a fantastic location. Highly recommend. Thank you for a lovely stay, we will return\nRoom Tip: A room at the rear has no view, but not a sound can be heard, great sleep!
