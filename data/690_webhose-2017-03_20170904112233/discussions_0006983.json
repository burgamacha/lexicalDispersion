I've stayed in quite a few NYC hotels over the last two years and this one has to be my favorite. The rooms are very nice and modern, not to mention decent sized (for NYC).\nThe added amenities of free breakfast, wine and cheese social hour, and free wifi were lovely.\nLastly, the staff couldn't of been nicer. Everyone was so polite and quick to answer any questions we had about the city. I would like to especially thank Monique at the front desk who really took care of my wife and I during our stay.\nHidden Tip: One other great thing about this hotel it is located directly across from Jimmy's Corner which is a little dive bar that has the cheapest drinks in Time Square. Talk about convenience!\nIf your looking for a hotel in or near the Theater District I would absolutely recommend staying at this modern boutique hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:49:57.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
