Yes, they are a little bit quirky - but thatâ€™s what I like about them. They are individual, not just some ordinary, standard chain hotel you find the world over.\nWe found our room to be more spacious than expected, as well as being clean and comfortable.\nThe hotel itself is located in a pedestrian precinct (albeit with limited vehicular access - e.g. taxis) - so it was very quiet. It is also very conveniently located, mid way between Opera and Madeleine Metro stations - just a few minutes walk to either.\nWe also found staff members to be excellent - always helpful and courteous.\nThe only reason I have awarded this hotel a 4 star rating rather than 5 is over breakfast management. This needs improving. The first morning we arrived for breakfast at 0930, and could see no member of staff to help us. We waited for almost 5 minutes before deciding to sit ourselves down and help ourselves. However, someone did eventually appear out of the kitchen to take our order. Furthermore, we found it tedious to have to keep asking for items that kept running out - e.g. butter, milk, jam, orange juice etc. In addition, on one occasion we were presented with the bill before we even had anything to eat even though we were on a inclusive package.\nBeware also that this hotel does not provide evening meals apart from bar snacks - a bit of a surprise. There are, however plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We had a meal in a restaurant called (V)ivre on Rue de la Michodiere; it was truly excellent.\nThat all said, I would recommend this hotel We enjoyed our stay, and would stay again when in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:46:21.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
