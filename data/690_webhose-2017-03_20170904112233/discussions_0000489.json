But, I was truly impressed with the authenticity of the service, and the commitment to customer care. The hotel has a spacious, airy lobby that is convenient for getting work done and on-the-fly meetings. Outstanding service at the front desk, which continues into the restaurant/bar... very good food here and jovial bar service, albeit just a bit on the pricey side. But one of the best attributes of the hotel (for airplane lovers like me): Astonishing views of the SFO airfield! I was stunned, and ended up watching heavies land all morning while getting my work done. Rooms are very clean and comfortable... standard-looking, but excellent bedding. I was offered a late checkout right at checkin, and assistance with planning transit to my meetings the next day if I needed it. Location is extremely convenient for layovers... 10 minutes by shuttle to the terminal. Based on the high quality of service, restaurant amenities, room comfort, and the view, I would plan a trip here just to watch airplanes all day... dream vacation for a guy like me, but a great spot for business too.\nRoom Tip: Airplane lovers: Ask for a room on the SFO side!
