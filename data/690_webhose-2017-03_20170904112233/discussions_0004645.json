Never been to Rome before. This hotel is perfectly placed to be near most of the major attractions, lovely restaurants and walkable from/to the Termini . The hotel is fairly new and the rooms and public area were very stylish, clean and comfortable. Our package included breakfast and they had a huge choice of things to suite everyone. The staff were wonderful and could not do enough for us, giving advice on restaurants in the location and general information. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would certainly return if we got the opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:35:22.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
