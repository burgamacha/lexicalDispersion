Even though the room was on the 4th floor, it was very quiet. We had a great view overlooking the park. The bathroom was very large with a large walk in shower and a large soaking tub. Everything was extremely clean and updated. Breakfast was not included with our room but breakfast is served in the hotel restaurant,Koi. There are other places for breakfast and lunch close by. They do have free Wi-Fi.
