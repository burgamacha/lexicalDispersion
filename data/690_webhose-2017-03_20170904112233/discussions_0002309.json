We were a bit apprehensive about going into the city for the night & a day, but any fears were quickly allayed. Apart from it taking a couple of hours to get out of the airport due to having to queue up for the necessary free 72 hour visas, under a sign called 'foreigners', the rest of the time in Beijing was great.\nThis hotel is extraordinary value. We had a premier room, (approx Â£70 for the two of us) which gave us access to the Premier Lounge at all times of the day for free tea, coffee & soft drinks. Between 18.00 & 20.00 we were invited to 'happy hour' in the Lounge & so expected reduced priced drinks and wandered up to see what was on offer. We were amazed to find a selection of alcoholic & non alcoholic drinks available and a range of 'lite bites' food, such as spring rolls, Chinese dumplings, crab claws, chips, chicken dippers etc, range of good cheeses, crackers, fruit and cakes all being enjoyed by both westerners & Chinese visitors. It was all free for the two hours and constantly replenished by very friendly staff. Add to that the fab breakfast buffet included, again something for everyone, from fresh omelettes cooked to order, full English & Chinese breakfasts, with lots of fruit, you can't go wrong.\nThe location was just a 15 minute walk from Tiananemm Square, Chairman Mao's mausoleum and the Forbidden City. It felt very safe walking around these areas and the Beijing citizens & visitors were all very friendly.\nOur onward flight was late at night & were welcomed back into the Longe for another 'happy hour' before we left the hotel, at no extra charge! We would definitely recommend this hotel for a stopover or a short break in Beijing.\nRoom Tip: A premium room is definitely worth it for all the extras you get with it.
