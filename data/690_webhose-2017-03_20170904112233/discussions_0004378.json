I've never been disappointed by the decision to go with the Roosevelt. The staff is friendly, the rooms are reasonably nice for the price, and the location close to Grand Central is convenient. I've had dinner at the bar a few times and found the food to be very good. The bar staff is a bit unfriendly for my taste but I think I could say that about bartenders at several other NYC bars as well so not a big deal.\nOverall, worth a look if you're in town and are looking for decent accommodations at a reasonable price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:58:46.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
