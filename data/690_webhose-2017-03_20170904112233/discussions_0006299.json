Did not look very spacious but it was fine for what we needed. Bathroom was spacious. Bed was comfortable. Prices of Drinks at Rooftop bar were way overpriced even for New York especially since i don't think they included the alcohol. ;) Same opinion for the dessert we decided to get at the steak house. 2 desserts for $30 is a little much. Overall the hotel was decent. Fairly close to time square. Temp in the room was a little funny. Seemed to always be too cold. Even when we turned up the temp on thermostat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:14:47.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
