We had a double room and were pleasantly surprised by how big the room was, by European standards. The bathroom was nicely sized also. Everything was spotless. The breakfast was great. If you don't want the full English breakfast, you can order just pieces of it - I had a big plate of scrambled eggs and toast each day. Wifi was strong in our room. There was some street noise, but it didn't bother us. The bathroom did not include washcloths, so if you need one, you might want to bring some from home! We took Heathrow Express into Paddington and loved how close the hotel was to Paddington. We enjoyed how close we were to Hyde Park. If you're fit, Harrods is walkable and there are plenty of tube stops nearby. We'd definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:13:37.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
