Good location and walkable distance to the Louvre (20 mins), and the gare du nord (25 mins).\nAs expected with the Marriott brand the standards are pretty consistant with subtle differences from city to city.\nFront desk staff were very polite and helpful. Concierge and bar staff not so much.\nWe had a suite so not much to say here clearly. The room was very large and had the comforts you would expect from a suite at this level of property.\nThe breakfast buffet is average only. We expected more when comparing with other Marrirotts in Germany and The Netherlands. Nothing special here.\nWe would stay here again", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:42:07.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
