Fantastic value with a limited view of the top of the Eiffel Tower from some rooms. ½ Mile away from the tower, the location is great. Quiet, clean, safe neighborhood, with full grocery store across the street and a laundry ½ block away. 1 Block away from the Metro, and great cafes everywhere. Make your reservation directly with the hotel and enjoy a great breakfast downstairs. Leave your TV on channel 82 to listen to Cherie FM - great station. This is a small hotel (maybe 36 rooms?) so very quiet and amazing service. Go for the executive room - comes with a local cell phone with maps and free outgoing calls. Worth it! Did I mention the staff? Best ever! Made our stay easy and stress free. LOVE THIS HOTEL!!\nRoom Tip: Top floor with partial tower view!
