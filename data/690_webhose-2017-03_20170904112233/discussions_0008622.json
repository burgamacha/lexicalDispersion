One of the smaller ones we have stayed in, but really cosy and well located. Good location for Southwark, the Globe, Tate, Borough Market etc, all within easy walking distance, London Bridge tube 10mins away too. Stayed in room 310 on top floor, slight views across the river to Gurkin, Walkie-talkie and Cheese Grater buildings. Room fairly newly refurbished, bathroom spotless. Staff friendly (Premier Inn training makes this consistent across the chain). Breakfast is at pub next door (not sampled). Room fresh and clean. Will stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:44:51.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
