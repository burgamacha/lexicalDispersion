Was looking for great location, good reviews, and priced inexpensive. Found it here at the Wellington.\nFirst of all, my greeting was the warmest of all, a gentleman showed me to my room. It was not the single that I thought, but a double room with two baths\nAlthough the decor is dated, I found it charming and warm. Vintage maybe.\nThe guest services were always spot on. They held my bag for me. I find it charming and inviting!! Would recommend to any loved one!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:58:16.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
