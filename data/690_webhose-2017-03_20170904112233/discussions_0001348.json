The only thing to watch out for is that frosted glass backed shower - perfect for shadow dancing to anyone else in the room (which I always find amusing).\nBreakfast is great - lots of choice, friendly staff although it can get a bit crowded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:31:52.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
