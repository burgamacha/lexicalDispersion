We had flights from Newcastle with Air France which was 1st class and great VFM. We used the roissy bus from CDG airport which again was easy and great value and took us into the centre. We walked up to the hotel in Montmartre and where blown away by everything from our check in, the room, the location and stunning views across the city. I had mentioned to the hotel that it was my wife's birthday and we had a brilliant room on the 6th floor with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower and a complimentary bottle of red! We stayed for 3 nights room only as we like to explore and the Montmartre district was superb for that. Quaint little streets full of hustle and bustle, great little shops, cafe bars and restaurants. A must do at the hotel is a visit to the roof top bar for a drink or cocktail and sit back and enjoy the night sky. The staff where very friendly and attentive and nothing seemed too much. The entrance lobby is a great indication of the rest of the hotel, bright, clean and modern. If you choose this hotel you will not be disappointed. Magnifique! We will definitely be back. Loved Paris.\nRoom Tip: 6th floor was excellent, the higher up gives the best view.
