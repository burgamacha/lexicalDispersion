My experience at this hotel was great given the price paid (got a nice discount before going there). The hotel was nicely decorated for Christmas. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk upgraded us to an executive room so That is what I will be rating. The room was spacious which is rare in Paris for this price. It was clean. The bathroom was a little tight but it's enough for a few nights. The bathroom was furnished with Hermes toiletry products. The room was really quiet. Breakfast was really good with a large selection. Hotel ideally located as it's a few meters only from the Eiffel tower. The hotel is modern, cosy and all personnel were very nice. I will most likely go back to this hotel given the great ratio of quality vs. price!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:54:33.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
