My room was very elegant, black-n-white combination. Big, comfortable bed. Closet large enough to fit all my stuff. There was a shower as well as bath in my room. Even the windows were facing the rue Cambon, the room was quiet. I had a breakfast as well as a quick lunch in the hotel restaurant, everything was good. The staff is really friendly and helpful. And the hotel cat ... I was so happy to meet a beautiful Olivier, amazing cat boy living in this hotel. I wish he could join me to the room :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:56:33.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
