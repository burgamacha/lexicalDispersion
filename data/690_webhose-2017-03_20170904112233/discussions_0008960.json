Over all the experience was pleasant. Our double room had a double bed as well as a single, was cleaned daily to a good standard and had a great shower etc.\nOne night we wanted to eat in the hotel as we were tired from a full day of work however the restaurant was fully booked for an hour and a half & the staff wouldn't let us sit in the 'breakfast area' of the restaurant as the tables were set for the following morning. I understand this reason but it was a bit of a shame to be turned away as we had to go across to the Hilton - which was actually lovely and would highly recommend!\nBreakfast was delicious with a great choice - including crumpets, which I love - but we are yet to try the normal menu!\nGreat location for business however we didn't venture much further than the Chinese nearby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:38:18.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
