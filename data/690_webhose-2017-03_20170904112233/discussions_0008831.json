Reception were really helpful booking trips and taxis. Restaurant was great, breakfast was fresh and there was food to suit all tastes. We stayed on a half board basis and could not fault the choice! The starters were huge, almost a meal in itself. The hotel is a little out of the centre, but for 10 euros you could get a taxi into the city. If I visit Rome again will definitely return to this hotel.
