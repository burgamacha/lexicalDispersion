Anyway - it suited us who needed place to rest in the evening.\nThe staff served us with cocktail in the afternoon in the living room next to reception - which was nice thing to enjoy, especially after roaming around Paris in the morning - and before going out again in the evening.\nBreakfast is standard, but staffs were very friendly. Felt like having breakfast at home. Dining room is tiny, but.. it serves the function of us getting our stomach filled before getting out and enjoy Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:27:05.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
