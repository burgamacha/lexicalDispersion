We chose this hotel for its great location- you can walk everywhere! The two highlights were certainly the incredibly helpful staff and the delicious breakfast buffet (which changed a bit daily, unexpectedly nice!)\nOur room was pretty tight with our luggage and shopping bags, but it was very clean and still a good value. European rooms are smaller than American rooms (and hotels in general!) so the size wasn't unexpected. The room got pretty warm and muggy even with the AC- I think it was on a fan setting and not AC? Maybe we had the settings wrong. We were also on the top floor so that may have had something to do with it. It was only March so it wasn't a big deal, but in August we'd need to figure it out for comfort!\nWe hope to return to Rome in the future and would definitely love to stay here again, though we'd happily pay more to upgrade to a larger room with a view next time!\nThe staff is truly wonderful. They're warm and cheerful, and they go above and beyond with fruit and treats in the room, a handwritten note on your last night, and even offering to open up breakfast early so you can eat before heading to the airport.\nTips:\nMake a dinner reservation at Osteria Barberini up the street. Best restaurant we ate at!\nYou need cash if you book the 55 euro car to the airport! We didn't save any and had to run to the ATM in the morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:35:09.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
