She gave us two places and they were both good, The room was very comfortable. We got a room with two queen size beds the first time and had to get a single king size the second time we stayed there. They overcharged my friend for the room on the first two nights, but got it resolved when we got back to New York. We had a mix-up with the rooms for the second night, but they fixed the problem, grudgingly, after Travel zoo called them and forced them to honor the original reservation. Over all it's a very nice hotel and I would consider staying there again. Especially since I'm kind of acquainted with the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:31:57.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
