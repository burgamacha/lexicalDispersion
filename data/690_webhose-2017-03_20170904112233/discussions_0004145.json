Lovely English owner very friendly and think we met the whole family nearly during our stay. Great value for money, room was pretty quiet considering its proximity to road and city centre, great base for exploring all Rome has to offer 25 minutes walk to Colosseum, 45 minutes walk to Vatican, lovely restaurant round the back of the hotel, Antica Boheme, ate there all 3 nights. Breakfast was fine for us lots of fruit, croissants, cereal, toast. And the coffee was great, would highly recommend to friends and when we return in the future will definitely come back here. Thanks to all the staff!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:34:55.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
