It's close to shopping, the metro, and all of the top sites - many rooms even offer a view of the Eiffel Tower.\nThe rooms feature modern decor, are spacious, and are very well kept. The entire hotel was very clean and welcoming.\nLastly, I will say the staff as exceptional. They were great to coordinate with before, during, and even after my stay. Every single person went above and beyond to make sure my fiancee and I had a wonderful time in Paris and they genuinely cared about making sure we enjoyed the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:46:43.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
