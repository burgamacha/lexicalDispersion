I was told by several people to be careful around the Gare du Nord as it was a sketchy area at night. My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case around this hotel.\nWalking through the neighborhood at night did not feel unsafe at all; there were few to no people that we saw ever. Mostly people were driving in cars and on motorbikes. It was also comforting to walk by a police station on the way to and from the Louis Blanc metro station as we always saw someone posted in a window watching the street when we walked by.\nIt did take a bit of traveling on the metro to get to most of the popular tourist attractions from the hotel. The hotel itself is about a 15-25 minute walk from Gare du Nord and only about a 5-10 minute walk from the Louis Blanc metro station. It was very convenient to get around where ever we were going with the metro and also the transfers to the RER trains.\nhotel itself was extremely modern and clean throughout the lobby and the rooms. The staff was extremely friendly and all of the front desk agents we interacted with spoke English fluently. The only complaint we had about the hotel was the size of the bathrooms. The toilet was placed awkwardly behind the bathroom door and the shower did not have a full door so water often got on the floor.\nOverall, this hotel was fantastic and relatively inexpensive for the offerings provided. We would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:40:20.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
