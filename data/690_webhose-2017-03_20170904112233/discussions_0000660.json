There were 7 ladies who descended on Christian and the staff for a week in January. It was bitterly cold but the hotel always made us feel safe and cozy. When it was decided that it was too cold to go up the Eiffel Tower for my birthday we looked around for an alternative. Christian offered to set up a private room for us. It was set with fresh linens and silverware. We brought our own champagne and picnic. What fun and how nice of the hotel.\nRoom Tip: Superior rooms are more spacious.
