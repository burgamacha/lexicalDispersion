The hotel was clean and welcoming (on this inside anyway, it did look a bit grim from the outside). We were able to check in early as we had a busy schedule, and the staff member who checked us in was helpful and friendly.\nThe room (at the back of the hotel) was surprisingly quiet, considering the location of the hotel on such a busy road, and we were even able to have the window slightly open during the night without being interrupted by noise. A lovely comfortable bed helped us to enjoy an excellent night's sleep.\nIt was good value (we paid Â£108 on a Friday night) and we would most certainly stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:30:35.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
