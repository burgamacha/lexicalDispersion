It seems to be paired with another hotel two doors down, as check in was directed to the Phoenix Hotel, via the door buzzer system.\nCheck in was lovely, the room was a well looked after basic set up. Two single beds smooshed (this is now a word) together. TV, hairdryer and basic show gels. Also had tea and coffee with biscuits. So for a two star, pretty good.\nRoom and bathroom were very clean and of a high standard.\nOnly slight issue was shower not fitting very well onto the hook on the shower, but only a minor niggle.\nWould happily stop there again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:54:02.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
