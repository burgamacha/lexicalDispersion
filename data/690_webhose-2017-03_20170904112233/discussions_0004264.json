It's close to the 3rd ring road and a metro stop. The breakfast buffet was very extensive with a lot of western and chinese dishes available. The coffee shop was much better value with sandwiches, coffee and amazing desserts available.\nThe service was very good and even the toilet was entertaining.\nThe bar was also fun for happy hour from 5pm-7pm.\nThe \"fog\" really smog, was bad the last day and we were even surprised how much it affected us.
