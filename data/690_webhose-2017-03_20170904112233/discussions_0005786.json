It is in a quiet , up market area and provided the peace we needed after a busy day out.\nThe bedroom was well soundproofed and we slept well. Breakfast is superb with a great choice of good quality produce. The only downside for us was that our room had no bath. Staff are only there when you need them and without exception they were charming. We shall return.\nRoom Tip: Some rooms have small balconies which must be nice in the summer.
