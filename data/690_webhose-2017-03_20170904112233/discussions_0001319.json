We had a great experience kicking off our 2 week trip in Italy. Everyone was so helpful with recommendations - one of the best meals we had was in the Jewish Ghetto and it we would have never have even know the restaurant was there if it was not for their recommendations. Also, two restaurants that are walk able from the resort were also amazing (we ate at one of them 2 times during the trip). The bus is across the street with two different lines coming every 8-10 minutes. The second day we were there we got back to our room and found homemade cake in the kitchen - the hosts could not be more thoughtful! They gave us a beautiful journal which my daughter used for the rest of the trip to write down what we did everyday. Do not hesitate in booking this hotel - it was absolutely perfect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:41:38.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
