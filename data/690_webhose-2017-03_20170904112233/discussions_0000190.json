Everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service in restaurants. The breakfast is so godd. They do a la carte, and you can order all that your heart desire!\nFood was beyond good and great value for money and service in Kona, attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I could go on but suffice it to say I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.\nNice touch with free drinks from 6-7 PM. Lovely!\nRoom Tip: Every room is a suite, so you can`t go wrong.
