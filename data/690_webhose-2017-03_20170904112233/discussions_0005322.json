Lobby & check-in are on the 4th floor. We stayed in a corner room on 33rd floor. All Hilton Garden Inns have showers -no tub. The room could use better black out drapes. A small room but very comfortable. This hotel features the Hilton Garden Inn Sleep System bed. Large bathroom with a floor to ceiling window overlooking The Times square ball. Coffee maker, microwave & fridge. Safe. Plenty of storage and outlets. Breakfast is good.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:30:26.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
