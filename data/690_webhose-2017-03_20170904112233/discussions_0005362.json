I stayed with my husband, 18, 13 and 10 year old for 1 night. I wish we were there longer. We saw a matinee then hopped on the subway back to the hotel. (15 min ride) The hotel is located only 1/2 block from Folton station, around the corner from the 9/11 memorial and museum and within walking distance to many shopping and restaurants. Check-in was quick and easy. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was huge, beautiful and clean! (I couldn't get over how big the room was) Because we are a family of 5 we stayed in the \"apartments\" that included a pull-out sofa and kitchen. I'm not sure if the hotel was full but Saturday night we did not run into any other guests. It was very quiet. However Sunday morning at breakfast was busy but not overly crowded. They had a great selection for breakfast and the staff kept everything replenished and clean. My youngest loved the make-your-own waffles. I can't wait to visit again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:18:27.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
