Location is great. A quiet spot but quick walking to all the downtown sights and hubs. The hotel is new, so very modern, clean and attractive. Very comfy bed I slept great here. And as I said it's quiet. The gym is good and well equipped although they could do with an extra bench because I had to wait to use the free weights. You don't get a free breakfast here is which is big draw back, but no problem for me. I just have cereal when I get to the office. There is a fun bar next door and a decent Indian restaurant. The room is small but functional (typical for NYC). You can stream your Netflix content straight to the TV which is a nice touch. If only I could log into my HBO account as well. Good quick wifi which is free as I have Gold status.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:39:43.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
