Hotel has a great location, close to many good restaurants and in close proximity to major access routes. It also offers basement parking (albeit a bit tight).\nWe had a warm welcome and staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms in Standard 2-bed apartment are quite small. Rooms were comfortable and clean, but a little noisy at night when balcony doors were opened. Apartment was on 1st floor, facing street, where there were a number of street cafes, explaining noise and smokers' fumes. In general the accommodation was average and did not quite live up to expectations created by photos on website.\nCentral location, friendly service and helpful staff made up for average accommodation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:05:34.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
