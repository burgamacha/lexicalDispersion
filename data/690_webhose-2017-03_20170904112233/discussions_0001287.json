Very quiet. If you want a Hilton this is not your hotel, if you want to walk out the front of the hotel, see the granny sweeping the street, the old men sitting and chatting then this is your place. Location is spot on. Around the corner into walking street with its selection of Chinese sweet treats and even a Starbucks for the desperate. Walking distance to Lama Temple, Confucius Gardens, Drum and Bell towers and the lake. An easy cab ride to Forbidden City & Tiananmen. Some coffee/wine bars a couple of hundred metres away Staff are friendly and very helpful, a traditional style Chinese restaurant, simple with a great variety of food, some sweet and spicy, at exceptionally cheap prices and overly generous portions. Breakfasts made to order or buffet while you chat with other travellers. We had the standard room for 8 nights, looking out to the rear courtyard, a bit tight with limited storage. The room was clean, the bed firm as its a wooden 4 post bed, modern bathroom. Everything worked and no funny smells. Having to depart at 4 am they offered us a packed breakfast for our journey. A nice touch.\nRoom Tip: Perhaps take a superior room for more space and storage See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:56:27.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
