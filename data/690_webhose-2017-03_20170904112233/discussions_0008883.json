The hotel describes itself as Boutique and is certainly on the trendy side. The staff were friendly and always helpful. The room was on the small side but I don't want to spend all my time in the room anyway. I could have done with more lighting and sockets in the room. On the plus side it was clean and had a very comfortable bed. We didn't eat in the hotel as there is an excellent diner next door and many other eating places nearby. Jimmy the doorman was very helpful. If you are looking for a hotel close to the major attractions in NYC you could do a lot worse than the Hudson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:49:11.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
