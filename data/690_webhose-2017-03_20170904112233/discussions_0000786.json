We were able to watch the shadow puppet show from our window, a great show. We did not find the noise from the courtyard intrusive at any time and our sleep, on firm but comfortable beds, was never disturbed. Breakfast was not as big as the larger hotels, but was more than adequate with a buffet of both western and Chinese dishes, and real coffee and cakes. We did a group tour to Jinshanling Great Wall booked through the hotel. It was well organized and well priced at RMB320. Comparing with other people on the tour from other hostels, we found that they had paid up to RMB410 for the same tour. The subway is about a 10min walk from the hotel through the daily life of the Hotungs. We highly recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Choose a Deluxe room overlooking the courtyard See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:00:45.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
