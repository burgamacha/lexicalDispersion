It was still not a lot of space to move about but we are a couple with a 5 year old so this met our requirements. The microwave, small fridge, cooktop and utensils were useful.\nThe hotel is located close to a metro station (De Villiers) about 200m away. There is plenty of shops around. Nearby is a market where you can buy grocery, baked food, vegetables and fruits.\nThe staff were excellent - all of them! The had answers to all your questions and concerns. Very friendly too.\nI have to specifically mention Jules - on our last day, on check out it was raining and we had our luggages and with the kid have to get to the metro station. It was certainly a problem going with the luggage in the rain but the place is too close to order a taxi. Jules took the trouble of coming with us and some umbrellas from the hotel to the metro station. This was very helpful and we really appreciate that!\nRoom Tip: We got the two storey rooms which was really good (room 103) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:43:02.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
