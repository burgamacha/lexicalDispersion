The suite that my family and I had was more than enough room and was very enjoyable. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathrooms came with a great shower along with a heated towel rack which was a great addition. The staff was more than friendly and accommodating. They took time out of their day to explain to us good areas to explore around London. In addition the hotel is in a perfect location near all of the wonderful sights in London.
