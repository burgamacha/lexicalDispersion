The location is good, just a minute walk from Reuilly â€“ Diderot Metro station. Number of cafes, MacD close by. Indian Restaurant just opposite to hotel .We stayed in studio apartment which was facing backyards. However, my friend who was in another studio, which was road facing. The apartment was having all basic kitchenette facilities including utensils. Due to metro it is easy to commute in late evening/night. Breakfast was good 10-12 euro per person.
