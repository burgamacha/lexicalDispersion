I'm not a big beer drinker but man do I love Kentucky bourbon barrel beer. And yes they had it !! Was I happy and surprised not many places in the north carry it! My husband ordered his usual Bloody Mary and complimented it.\nOur cup of soup was a special on the menu. Corned beef and carrots soup . Delicious flavor , loaded w meat and carrots . Great use of leftovers that I will use at home next year . Best pit stop in a long time . We viewed other dishes being served generous portions !", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:14:09.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
