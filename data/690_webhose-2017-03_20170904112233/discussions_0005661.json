We booked it based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, but really didn't know what the expect.\nWe were thrilled from the moment we drove through the gate. The hotel is clean, airy, and light and instantly made us feel happy. Every member of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, regularly going above and beyond to ensure that we enjoyed our stay and that we were comfortable.\nBreakfast was delicious and plentiful every day, the room was always clean and inviting, the views from our sea view room balcony were stunning. There were lots of little extras that the hotel provided to make sure we were well taken care of, such as the ipad and local cell phone provided for us to use during our stay.\nWe relied heavily on the staff's recommendations for activities and restaurants to try, and they were spot on every time.\nThe hotel is situated a little out of the main area of the town, but it was not overly difficult to walk to town (about 10 min). Cabs are also easily available with a phone call.\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our stay at One Marine Drive and would book another stay with them in a heart beat. Now if only I could figure out how to get a hold of one of those adorable stuffed animals whales that they had around the hotel!\nRoom Tip: our sea view room on the second floor was stunning!
