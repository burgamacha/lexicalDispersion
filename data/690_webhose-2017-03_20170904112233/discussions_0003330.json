The rooms are relatively small but well appointed, modern and with extremely comfortable beds. We only chose the breakfast option on our last morning, which we then released was a mistake, as it offers excellent value for 12 euros. They offer a wide spread of lovely fresh food. We found the staff at reception to be so helpful and friendly and willing to provide you with whatever information you needed or assist with tourist bookings. There are a number of good restaurants close by. I would definitely choose to return to this hotel on my next visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:41:14.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
