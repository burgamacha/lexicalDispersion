As a Marriott platinum guest I'm often upgraded to a suite and I was again this time. Beautiful spacious room. Spotless bedroom and bath areas. Comfortable big bed. Great service level. This hotel is a great value in the Paris area. It's practically on top of the RER station as well as the No1 subway line that runs straight to the Arch. 15 min subway ride to the heart of Paris without the congestion and noise. Love this hotel - will return on my next trip to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:24:55.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
