All the staff of the hotel was welcoming and friendly, our waitresses was lovely and the waiter and head I believe Marius was great helped out the whole time offering more food etc throughout. This was definitely one of the best afternoon teas we have visited for not only location and atmosphere but afternoon tea was beautiful. We was asked if we would like to take the rest home which we did and our waitress kindly also gave us lots more of the delicious scones. Would recommend this to all friends and family and would return. Thanks again for the lovely day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:25:13.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
