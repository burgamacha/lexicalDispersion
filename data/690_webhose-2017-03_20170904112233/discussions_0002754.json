Although the room was not large, they make excellent use of the space. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable, and there were two television sets - one in the sleeping area, and one in the sitting area. (The sitting area had a love seat/sofa.) The front desk staff was very friendly and professional. The location is great -- very near to Macy's and the Empire State Building and a short walk to many other areas, including the Times Square theaters. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:39:13.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
