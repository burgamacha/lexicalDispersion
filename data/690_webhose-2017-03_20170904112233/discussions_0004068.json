Not far from the convention center or times Square. Just a block away from plenty of dining or stores. The staff was all very nice minus the fella in the restaurant who told me they didn't have eggs other than scrambled when I tried to order off the menu. The bar is tiny but the bartenders are very friendly and poor a nice drink. And it wasn't hard to get a seat. Rooms were clean and tended well. And the towels were soft! Ended up here and extra night due to bad weather and the staff still took excellent care of their guests!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:57:32.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
