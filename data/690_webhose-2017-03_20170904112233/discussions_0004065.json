We would recommend this hotel to anybody wanting to stay in new York close to most things but not too noisy. Skyline deli across the road is absolutely fab, low prices and wonderful food open 24 hours a day, last thing the swimming pool is an added bonus and really nice. Thank-you skyline hotel for a wonderful stay", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:18:47.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
