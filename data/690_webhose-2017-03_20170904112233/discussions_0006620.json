We arrived at Penn Station and were able to walk to the hotel. Our plan was to see a play at the Public Theater, so again we were able to walk. We also went to Chelsea Market easily from here. The room was average size for NY. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and nicely appointed. Enjoyed our stay. They are currently undergoing renovations in the lobby, so I can't speak to that space or the dining room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:58:22.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
