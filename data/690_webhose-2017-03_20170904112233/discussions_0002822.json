Rooms clean , fresh & comfy. When we arrived our booking agent had cancelled our booking. Despite this the reception staff sorted out a room for us & the hotel manager saw us the next day & reassured us she wold fix it, she did. (cancellation due to agents technical fault) All staff extremely helpful & friendly. Good bar prices too.\nNice restaurant nearby called Nerone .
