The manager Fabien was amazing and had the package sent over to me in London - never would l have expected that.\nAmazing hotel, Amazing Staff - Will definitely be returning!\nRoom Tip: Definitely get a bath :) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:46:15.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
