However the room was very comfortable, with lovely clean fluffy towels every day. Fantastic shower, hot water all the time. five minute walk to the Metro so easy to get around Paris and see al the sites. At night if you don't want to go too far there are plenty of bars and restaurants right by the hotel. The Sacre Coeur is a 10 minute walk. The hotel staff are fantastic, very helpful and the breakfast is continental and plenty for anyone. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were made to feel very welcome. When we visit Paris again we will stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:00:31.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
