The property will make you question of prior decision to stay at other properties.\nThe treatment of the staff is second to none! I often tell them they are making very difficult for me to leave!\nI strongly suggest this Resort regardless of the occasion. You will not be disappointed!\nMunyonyo Commonwealth Resort, Kampala, Uganda-East Africa.\nMy home away from whenever I'm in East Africa!\nSafe travel,\nReggie Word", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:23:22.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
