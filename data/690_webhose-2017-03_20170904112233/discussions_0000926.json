I travel extensively to very wonderful hotels and tend to be a repeat guest at the places where I feel \"at home.\" The library at the Ham Yard with a cup of tea in the afternoon is my idea of enjoyable hospitality. Yet, my last trip -- #5 in 18 months -- was slightly marred by less than gracious staff. Example: I arrived in London on a night flight with my carry-on luggage in tow. The bellman \"assisted\" me by taking my suitcase out of the car. When I turned to take my bag to my room after registering, it had disappeared. The bellman \"secured\" it in a closet and was slightly snarky when I retrieved it without tipping him. I expected the bag to be next to me. At departure another obsequious bellman expected a tip for \"service\" from the registration desk to the front door. It's annoying. Staff need to more discerning in offers for assistance and less focused on gratuities. Lackadaisical service in the dining room was also an issue. And we waited 20 minutes for a drink from the bar. Whatever is going on behind the scenes should be rectified before it metastasizes . Of course, I'll return and hopefully the issues are no longer issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:27:00.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
