Check-in was a painless process: the staff were welcoming and efficient. Room 344 was a not large but more than sufficient to hold a large double bed and storage furniture. A kettle with tea/coffee was provided - a pleasant surprise, because we have found other Italian hotels do not do this and so brought our own. Free wifi and free use of the mini-bar to store our own drinks. The bathroom was very spacious and, like the room, maintained to a good standard. The French windows opened onto a side road which was quiet throughout. Breakfast, served between 6.30 and 10.30, was good with a range of cold meats, cheese, etc, and cereals, scrambled eggs, etc for those missing home. Rome has a decent underground and the hotel is five minutes away from the main station. An excellent experience for a short stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:36:40.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
