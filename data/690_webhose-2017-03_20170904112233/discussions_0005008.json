My next surprise was when, because of my gold status they put us up in a corner room, with a view of the Hudson, amazing! Location was perfect for walking to and from the train (both Penn Station and Grand Central were 15/20 minutes walks) Also around the corner from many broadway shows. Staff checking in and at the bar could not have been nicer.
