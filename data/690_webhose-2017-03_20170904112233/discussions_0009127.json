Gorgeous rooms have antique touches, yet feel contemporary. Marble bathrooms are sumptuous, though most levels (including the Premium King) are without baths as is the norm in New York. Excellent quality bath products, linens and - comfiest slippers ever! Wi-fi, amenities, cleaning and turndown service all faultless.\nPublic spaces are stunning, perfectly utilising the bones of the old Temple Court building, with artworks to die for. The atrium bar simply has to be experienced though be warned you will need to book a table. Restaurants are a mixed bunch. We experienced bafflingly chaotic service at Fowler & Wells though the food was decent - they also run room service and the atrium bar, which both had very minor efficiency issues. But opening the door to Keith McNally's warm inviting Augustine for a glorious dinner was like coming home; the food, service and ambience here completed the whole experience.\nWe may have found our new go-to hotel in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:36:26.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
