We were picked up at the Airport by Stefano's RomeCabs which I had booked up on their website from UK. Great Service, and was collected from my hotel for the return leg. again great service. Check in was quick and pain free. The room was of an ok size with Kingsize bed and nice bathroom with the usual amenities. All very clean except for an area of the carpet which was quite grubby and really needed deep cleaning. Not the fault of the room maid but a fault of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was included in the Expedia deal and was more than adequate. The area outside the hotel has a large number of eateries to fit all budgets but it is the location of the hotel which prompted my return. 15 min walk to Trevi, 12 Min to Colosseum and 3 Min walk to the Metro with the rest of Rome. I would certainly return to this hotel and recommend it as your base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:28:35.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
