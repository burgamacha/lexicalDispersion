The room was great and it was a quiet neighborhood. The neighborhood was very clean with charming townhouses lined up and down the streets, we never had any trouble and it was right across the street from Hyde park! We were provided with lots of amenities, toiletries and maps. The room was lovely and the bed was so comfortable. We bonded with Staff members over the love of musical theatre,restaurants and London life and enjoyed catching up with everyone after a long day out. We dined at the townhouse restaurant and enjoyed the unique chandeliers and soothing music in the lounging area. The hotel is located with nearby shops/late night snacks and waitrose supermarket is a stone throw away. Thanks so much everyone for a hospitable and memorable stay, also special mention to Segolene,George and Sandor.\nRoom Tip: There is a cocktail bar that serves excellent cocktails See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:55:49.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
