Normally we stay at five star hotels for 1 to 2 weeks. American Express suggested this hotel. It was close to where we had some business to do as well as close to the theater district. This is a beautiful small boutique hotel. We stayed in room 1701 which is a beautiful executive room with a nice view looking down 46 street. The bathroom was unusually large and comfortable for New York. The room was beautifully decorated. The staff could not be more accommodating.would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:21:32.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
