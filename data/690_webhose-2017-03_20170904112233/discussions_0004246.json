The room was plenty big for all four of us-especially since we were out and about all day, only back to sleep. The bathroom is amazing. Bathtub with shower, another stand alone shower, two sinks. Really beautiful and spacious. Since we were on the ground floor we didn't have a window onto the street. It opened into a small courtyard which was fine and key in a little natural light. Next time maybe we won't bring the kids and get a room on another floor with a street view. ;)\nDecor is traditional French. I found it lovely, and just perfect for our purposes. We will be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:44:25.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
