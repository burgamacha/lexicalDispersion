Parked there as well.\nThe con (for me anyway)\nIts the choice of a 20 minute walk to Colindale tube stn or a bus journey if you get off the tube at Hendon. Now that doesnt seem a problem in itself but after a full day in London its not ideal. Thats no fault of the hotel of course, hence my high rating, its just something to be aware of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:09:16.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
