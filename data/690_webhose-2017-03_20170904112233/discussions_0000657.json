Everything about our stay was smooth and lovely. Comfy bed, amazing view (see picture - taken from balcony of our room), helpful staff - even impressed with the smaller touches like room decor (photographic prints of the interior of the Paris Opera House, I believe) and bathroom lighting (first hotel in memory when I felt like I could actually tell what my makeup really looked like when looking in the bathroom mirror). When we wanted to check out a bit late, no problem at all. Big thumbs up.\nRoom Tip: Deluxe Room with Balcony and Tower View turned out great for us!
