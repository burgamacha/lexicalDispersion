There was a problem with the hot water but the hotel, it's manager and it's staff dealt with it in the highliest professional manner to our satisfaction. The room was super clean, beautifully designed and well equiped.\nThe bed was comfortable aswell as the covers and pillows. The room was cleaned everyday.\nThe seemingly noisy street was cut off through the windows closed which gave us a sound sleep and a good rest.\nThe locations is quite perfect for everything with it's aproximity to montmartre, opera and gare du nord.\nWe would recommend the hotel for sure and would love to come back.
