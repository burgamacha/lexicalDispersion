We spent three perfect days there, leaving for home Christmas morning. The staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was large and comfortable, and with the exception of a middle-of-the-night fire alarm caused, we were told during checkout the next morning, by a guest smoking in his room, our stay was memorable. We look forward to our next stay.\nRoom Tip: Opt for the executive rooms. Classic rooms can be tiny.
