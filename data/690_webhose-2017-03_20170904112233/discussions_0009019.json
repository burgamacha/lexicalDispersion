Great property welcoming staff We went on 24th Feb for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the stay with walkable distance to prime location like Times Square and central London and cafes. We where checked in early as the rooms there vacant and some big group had just checked out . During our stay the rooms where cleaned regularly every day and toiletries where also changed. Staff was very friendly and always welcoming. Overall it's a perfect location with a amazing property with all amenities !", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:09:54.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
