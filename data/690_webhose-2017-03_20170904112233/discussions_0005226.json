As it was our anniversary they very kindly upgraded us to a top floor room and gave us a few drinks vouchers which was a lovely touch. The hotel is very modern and the room a reasonable size for New York. The room was clean, with a comfortable bed and contained everything that we required for our stay, including a coffee machine and a microwave. The location is the main selling point, it is right next to times square and a 30 second walk to the subway. We were able to walk to walk to the majority of the main attractions from this base, which was perfect for us and as you can imagine there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Despite the busy location we had no problems with noise from outside and the curtains were effective at blocking out the light.\nThe only downfalls of our stay was that the air conditioning unit in our room was very loud and woke me up several times as it came on. We also had flies in the shower which I think were coming from our drain, although they are looking into this. Breakfast is also very expensive, so we ate out instead. However, despite these issues I would certainly stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:35:12.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
