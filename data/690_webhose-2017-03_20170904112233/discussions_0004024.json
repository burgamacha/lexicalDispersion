First off the room size is what impressed me the most. We had a double queen suite and it was bigger than many Manhattan apartments. I was with my sister and my 7-year-old niece, the space was perfect for us! It was also clean which is a plus in this town! The staff was fantastic as well, friendly, welcoming and will to help. The location is perfect if you are looking to cover the entire city. It's close to the 4, 5 and 6 subway lines and a short cab ride away from tourist attractions in Midtown, Central Park, Times Square and the Theatre District. The location is busy and noisy but that is what you should expect staying in Midtown, other than that I could not hear other guests. It is pricey but worth every penny. I will be back again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:25:21.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
