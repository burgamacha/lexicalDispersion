We were in room 321, right next to the elevator and stairs. The only time we ever heard noise outside of our room was people taking the stairs when breakfast began. No big deal.

Walk a few blocks east to Rue Malar and eat at L'Ami Jean for one of the best meals of your life!\nRoom Tip: Courtyard-facing rooms are super quiet.
