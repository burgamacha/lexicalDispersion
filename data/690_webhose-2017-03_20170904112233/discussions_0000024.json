The more important issue was the airport shuttle. Front desk told us it left every 10/15 minutes and even gave us a little schedule of times. But when we went down, we ended up waiting 30 minutes with no shuttle ever arriving. No communication from staff, no explanation -- just a bunch of anxious people wondering if there would be enough room in the van for everyone and if they'd make their flights. To his credit, the driver was clearly working hard to be quick, efficient, and pleasant. Thankfully I had left ample time before my flight, but this is a serious concern if you're positioned as an airport hotel with a shuttle on an actual schedule.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:28:25.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
