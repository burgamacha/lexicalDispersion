It was important for me to have a hotel close to Waterloo Station for my early morning travels.\nThis hotel's easy and quick access to the tube was the big driver, and I found it perfect for what I wanted. The staff were very welcoming and efficient in both check-in and checkout. Whilst the breakfast in this hotel is quite good, the dinner restaurant, which includes a bar, is not something i could write home about. For dinner, I would suggest any of the restaurants close by some of which are along the River Thames.\nFor a business traveller in London for more than two nights, not sure I would recommend especially if relaxation space and unwinding is important. This hotel has all the basic elements but none of the frills that sometimes you need on a long business trip.\nGreen Features: Hotel is modern and encourages lowering your carbon footprint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:51:08.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
