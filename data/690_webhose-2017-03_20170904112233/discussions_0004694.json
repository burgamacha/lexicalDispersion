I was upgraded to superior room, which is spacious, clean, well-equipped, facing inner courtyard and no street noises at all. Double-door design at room entrance which means you hardly hear noise from corridor as well. Bed also very comfortable and I would like to make it home in Paris.\nLocation is excellent, 5 mins to Galleries Lafayette, few minutes to Madeleine metro station, lots of good cafe & restaurant nearby.\nReasonable room rate but in high quality of everything. Highly recommended.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:00:19.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
