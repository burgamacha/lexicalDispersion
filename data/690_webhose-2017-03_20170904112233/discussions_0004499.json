In a Business or family trip around La Defense area\n2. Looking for a location where you would get everything nearby\nThis is a decent place where I stayed twice and the last time was in Feb 2017. La Defense office area / metro station etc. are all within walk-able distance (10-15 mins). If you want to cook, do so at room where you have all utensils. You would get Auchan & Carrefour markets very close to it. There are other shops too.\nIf you do not want to cook, you would get Subway / other restaurants very close by. Having kids? You will get a park just opposite to it. Need SIM card? You would get small phone shops very close. What else would you need?\nThe breakfast is just ok. The reception is open 24 X 7. Only thing that they could have done is to have a housekeeping free of cost offered in the middle of one week stay. Just read the T&C at the time of booking to have correct expectation on housekeeping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:25:24.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
