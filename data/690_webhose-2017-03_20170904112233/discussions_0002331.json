We could barely get around the bed (see photo), and our first room didn't even have a door to the toilet, just a shower curtain... However, the staff was nice enough to change our room. The new room was just as small, but at least it had a toilet door ;-) The rooms were clean, looked newly renovated, and the bed was comfortable.\nAll staff members were English-speaking, very friendly and service-minded.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:40:11.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
