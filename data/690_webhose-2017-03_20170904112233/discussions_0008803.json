The location was great (short walk to Buckingham Palace) with lots of restaurants nearby. If you stay here, go for breakfast to the bakery across the street. Great coffee and food! When we checked in, my daughter received a packet with crayons, coloring books and random toys which of course she loved.\nOur room was nice with 2 beds plus a roll away bed for our daughter. They had free wifi as well. They also had USB charging ports in the wall, which was nice because we only brought one charger and couldn't keep up to charging all of our devices.\nThe only downside was the lack of restaurants in the hotel. The one they had refused to do take out, so we ended up going to the Thai place a block away. I definitely recommend this hotel if you're coming to London with kids.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:54.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
