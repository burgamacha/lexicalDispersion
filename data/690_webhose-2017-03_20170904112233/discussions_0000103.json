Mr Holy who personally escorted us to the Muslim restaurant and even arranged a car to pick us up.\nMrs Amy from housekeeping and the manageress of peacock restaurant who personally brought me the vegetarian soup from the Chinese restaurant and many other lovely staff from the door man to the bell boy and other staff who all had a lovely smile on their face and would rush to welcome us and assist us the moment we would arrive at the hotel doorsteps.\nI have never felt this personal attention and warm welcome in any hotel before like WA of Beijing.\nIt felt like being among family members in other words home away from home.\nLiterally they would embarrass us in terms of their hospitality, warmth and kindness.\nThe room layout and view was also spectacular and so was the decor and amenities.\nExcellent sound proofing and privacy for each room entrance.\nFood quality and the ambiance in the breakfast hall was great too.\nRoom Tip: Panoramic view from the premier suite See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:20:26.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
