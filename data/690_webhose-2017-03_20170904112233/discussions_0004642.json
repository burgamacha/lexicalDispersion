Our room was lacking some pictures on the walls and one or two other minor touches, also a kettle was supplied but no cups,milk,tea bags etc-strange?. Guess we could have asked for cups but didnt bother. Safe also in room.\nEverywhere kept very clean with good quality towels. Bed firm but very comfortable.\nBreakfast was good with enough choice to start the day.\nHotel staff friendly and check-in/ check-out painless, however there is a city tax which works out â‚¬4pp/pd.\nHotel does have a residency but only ever saw two people during our stay and they have separate exit/entrance door from hotel.\nVery good stay and really excellent value at this time.\nWould recommend.\nRoom Tip: Rooms overlooking small inner courtyard are quiet at night.- courtyard are very quiet at night.
