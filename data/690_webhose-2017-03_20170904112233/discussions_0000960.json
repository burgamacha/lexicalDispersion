The hotel is a great base for exploring the city. We walked to a lot of the attractions and sights, but if needed the concierge will flag a taxi for you. We did opt for the hotel for its location, but we were thrilled when we arrived as it exceeded our expectations.\nThe service is impeccable, always polite and no trouble at all. They booked us in to Tonys next door one evening and the breakfast waitresses were delightfully helpful.\nThe room was good, probably could do with an update but it was no issue for us as it was all very clean and the bathroom toiletries were lovely.\nThere is an additional extra list of amenities which you can request for your room. The coffee machine is a great addition.\nWe found breakfast really good. A great choice and an ample and relaxing start to the day.\nThe only suggestion I would make, would be an additional couple of tables for breakfast. There are plenty of seats available but it sometimes means table sharing, which on a morning is not necessarily welcome.\nWe had a great stay and when we return to NY we will be staying at The Casablanca.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:50:27.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
