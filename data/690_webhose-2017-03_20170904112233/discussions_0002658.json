Thats approx £235 per week. Because my friend and I had separate rooms , we are not a couple, we were charged this fee twice. £470 on top of our hotel charge. The facility fee I believe covers wifi and a coffee facility in the reception area , mornings only, there are no hot drinks facilities in the rooms. There may also be other facilities not recalled.\nWe accepted this additional fee however , what marred things right at the end when we knew we had to leave our rooms by 12pm and were not collected until 4.30pm was a grovelling discussion by myself to ask for extra time in the room . The reception area was bitterly cold as the front door opened to -degree temperature and the gale blew inside. My friend is 85 and to sit for 4.5hours in the cold reception lounge was not a pleasant thought.\nI asked at reception if having paid the facility fee twice , but still only 2 people people , could we have the rooms until we left at 4.30pm. I was told that if I paid this would be possible but if not an extra 1 hour only, this was extended to 2 hours after some grouchy discussions , not nice.\nSadly this quite spoilt our outgoing time. We could not leave the hotel during the last 4 .5 hours as the temperature was minus and bitterly cold.\nI do think if the Roger could offer us the room at a charge , they could have done so at No charge as we had paid so much more in their facility fee.\nMaybe a thought for the future \"Roger\" otherwise really nice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:29:48.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
