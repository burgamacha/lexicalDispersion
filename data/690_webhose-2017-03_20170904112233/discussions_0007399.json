We called before we got there if it was okay to come a little early. That was no problem and when we arrived we got an upgrade to a room with view at the Eiffel tower including a balcony! It was awesome to see the Eiffel tower every morning and evening when it lights up. The room was clean and the bathroom was really nice. We got our breakfast included and we thought it was really nice. There was a lot of variety for us. There were croissants and other types of bread, fruit, yoghurt, eggs, bacon, pancakes and more. The personnel was really friendly. We even got a late check-out with no fee, so that was awesome too! The hotel is close to all the attractions if you like to walk, otherwise you can use the metro. We would stay here again if we visit Paris!\nRoom Tip: View from the front at the Eiffel tower!
