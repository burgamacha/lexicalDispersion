From start to finish the staff were friendly, helpful and extremely attentive. We arrived earlier than anticipated (12pm), and as check-in wasn't until 3pm we expected a wait of a few hours. This wasn't the case. The delightful staff informed us our room was already ready and they checked us in quickly and helped transporting our luggage to our room. The rooms are a good size considering how cramped other hotels in Paris are, and ours had a small balcony. The rooms are very modern as was the bathroom, which was ideal.\nWe stayed for two nights and left with a massive smile on our faces. All of the staff were extremely helpful in helping us, whether it be advising us on what metro stations and routes to use, to bringing us a corkscrew for a bottle of wine in the middle of the night! They made a lovely weekend in Paris even more perfect than I could have wished for. Came home with one very happy fianc√©e. I Will be booking this hotel again without doubt! Thanks guys!\nArron Dosanjh", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:33:01.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
