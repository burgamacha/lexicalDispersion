The hotel, built in 1901, retains all the Edwardian charms of high ceilings, mahogany woodwork, & fireplaces yet offers mod cons like WiFi, bottled water, and comfy beds at excellent value. The area is filled with fragrant flower shops, bewitching brownstone townhouses, and intriguing boutiques. A quick walk takes you to six of New York's finest museums. And if you pre-pay like I do, the discount will cover your meals out. The attentive staff are the finishing touch for why I enjoy and recommend the Hotel Wales.\nRoom Tip: Rooms overlooking Madison Ave offer light and great people watching!
