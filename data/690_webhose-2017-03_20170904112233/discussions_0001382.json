Location is excellent, just 5 mins from the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. Rooms excellent, no bath, but this is in the middle of a major capital. Breakfast was excellent with many gluten free options, which was excellent for my wife who is Coeliac. The best part of the hotel is the staff. They were all so lovely and helpful. Jerry on reception is absolutely bonkers and was fantastic for restaurant suggestions and wanting to help. The staff at breakfast were great, always so attentive, but with a smile. It was my wife's birthday while we were there and hotel made it even more of a special day. Thank you guys and keep up the good work", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:24:55.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
