Chose the Xenia because it looked individual (one of the autograph collection) and is situated in Kensington close to the big museums and was a short tube ride from the west end. Another excellent point was the parking - £15 for 24hrs in the Sainsburys next door - a detail that is not mentioned anywhere on the web site. In fact the Marriott right across the road has it's own car park at over £30 per day! - and that is a pretty basic business class hotel.\nThe Xenia definitely has it's own character. On arrival, the reception staff were very friendly. We were upgraded and were pleasantly surprised by the standard of the room. We ate in the Italian restaurant before heading off to a show. The food was wonderful - Michelin starred chef and the staff once again cheery. Look out for the dessert called \"Sorry Mama - I dropped the flower pot\" - superb. Breakfast was also good - served in the lovely surroundings of the restaurant. Not the standard Marriott breakfast - a notch up again.\nAll in all - a cracking find. Would definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:14:49.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
