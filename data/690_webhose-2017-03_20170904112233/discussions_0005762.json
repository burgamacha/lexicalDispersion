Not big, not small, typical for Paris i would say. The bed is comfortable to sleep it, the wardrobe is big enough to leave your stuff. There is a small safe and fridge - but as far as i understood no free of charge bottled water.\nBathroom // big enough, clean shower, clean sink, good towels, nice amenities.\nBreakfast // 22â‚¬. Well, the fruits are fresh, but overall a bit overpriced for what you get. Ots in the same room where the reception is. I took it only 1 day out of my 4 night stay. Good thing is that its almost until 11am - which is quite long.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:27:16.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
