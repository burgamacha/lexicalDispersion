The building is beautiful. Very convenient and close walk to the Metro so you can go anywhere and even then there's plenty of restaurants aroumd there. The decor screams Paris, which I loved!\nThe staff were all very wonderful, helpful and extremely respectful to all of their guests including us.\nOverall a very good experience staying in this hotel, very worth it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:28:54.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
