The hotel was perfect, 10-20 minute walk to most of sights Trevi fountain, pantheon, Spanish steps, colesseum, memorial. The reception staff were so helpful with booking restaurants, advice on attractions and the bar and breakfast staff Federico and co made our stay very welcoming and perfect. A lovely surprise was the lovely roof terrace, perfect for relaxing after a long days walking. We will definitely stay here again next time we visit", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:38:00.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
