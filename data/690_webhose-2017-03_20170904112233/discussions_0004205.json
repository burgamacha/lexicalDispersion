The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was very good - a mixture of the standard Italian breakfast with the addition of eggs and bacon that Americans are used to. The location is great - we walked almost everywhere, but it is very close to both the Metro and train station. Our room had its own thermostat and Wifi was good. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The hotel was able to hold our bags after checkout so that we could make the most of our last day in Rome.\nCons: The only negative is that the bathroom has glass doors. This doesn't offer much privacy in a small room. (It looks nice though!)\nI would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 5th floor which eliminated any street noise.
