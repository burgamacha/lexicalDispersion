From the moment we arrived until minute we left, we could not fault the hotel or its staff, I had emailed before we arrived asking for a room with a view as we were visiting for my wife's birthday, Room 2305 had great views from the corner windows facing east to the river and north to the Chrysler building, fantastic views day and night. Staff had also left a small biscuit and refreshment pack alongside a birthday ballon for my wife, it's the little detail that make a hotel successful and Dumont staff have got this just right. Centrally located for the whole of New York with Grand Central Station or the Empire State Building only 5 minutes away, the subway on 33rd street is just round the corner and takes you all the way to Brooklyn Bridge. I had arranged for a package to be delivered to the Hotel by US Post and staff were very helpful in ensuring I received package before I departed home. The Hotel offer a very welcome happy hour 5 - 6pm every day serving free wine, most appreciated after a long day sightseeing.\nSome previous reports have stated Hotel is in need of a refresh, but I found it to be very clean and more than suitable for our needs. Most important for me was the fact all the staff from the doorman, front of desk staff to the housekeeping team were very friendly, pleasant and professional, this more than made up for any very minor decorating requirements.\nWhen I ever go back to New York the Dumont NYC Affinia Hotel will be my only choice.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on a high floor as views are excellent.
