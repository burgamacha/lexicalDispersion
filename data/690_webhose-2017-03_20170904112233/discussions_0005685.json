I love Soho, we've never stayed here so yeah being a lover of shopping and designers it was a treat :) walking in I love that staircase! Sort of confusing though you aren't sure exactly where to check in but luckily some people told us. We booked an amazing suite for what I consider our anniversary part 2 since our stay last month at the Waldorf sucked. This is a hotel that's more our style, modern, hipper, Soho, yeah. I also love that they allow dogs though we left ours at home. (Our dogs are like children but we like to leave them home for a night off lol) I loved our suite and I kept saying I can't believe I'm finally staying here. I think we might have to try the Roxy next.... I loved our stay and loved this hotel. I loved the decor, the bathroom, the fact we could watch netflix, how close it is to amazing food, cocoa, and of course shopping. I have to say this was one of our best stays in the city and I love our little staycations from long island. Check for flash sales people! I love sales because honestly I rather spend the extra money on a suite :)\noh they also left some cookies my hubs scarfed down, seriously he didn't leave me one lol. was a nice gesture :) also for some good cocoa check out La Burdick! it's close by and delicious. I wont even say restaurants because there are so many but Carbone or Osteria Morini...
