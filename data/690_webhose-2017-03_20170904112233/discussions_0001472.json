When I returned later in the day, the room was as described. It was clean, quiet and comfortable.\nThe breakfast omelette was quite good, albeit a bit slow. If made for order omelettes are important to you I recommend going early before the crowds. Plenty of good lunch dinner options nearby with a variety of price points. I am glad I came back to this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Most of the rooms face into the building, a few over look the plaza.
