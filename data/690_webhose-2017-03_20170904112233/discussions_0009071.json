It was cozy and I had a nice view of the street below, which was quiet at night.\nThe hotel is within walking distance of Paddington station which was a selling point for me as I was planning on using the underground for all of my transportation.\nThe people at the front desk were polite and professional. The continental breakfast was fresh and filling. The hotel overall seemed well-maintained.\nDo be advised that there is no elevator in the hotel and there are a lot of stairs to climb if you're on one of the upper floors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:49:31.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
