Not very conducive to a peaceful evening or night. There was no room to place my suitcase either. Service otherwise was ok, but housekeeping service was always late in the afternoon and after a day of work one prefers to return to a room that is made up.\nI may consider a different hotel in the area for my next visit as a repeat visitor does not seem to do make it easier on the customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:07:20.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
