I was pleased to find we had a choice of queen-size room at the front or an upgrade to a king-size at the rear on the 9th Floor, which we chose. There was no view and it was a little dark, overlooking nearby buildings. However it was very spacious with a seating area, plenty of storage and a large bathroom with separate shower and bath. A much bigger room than other hotels we have stayed at in the city. The room was immaculately clean and maintained to a very high standard throughout our stay. All the staff members we encountered at the hotel were warm and welcoming, friendly, polite and very professional. The concierge offered help and advice for our daily excursions, which proved very helpful.\nAs has been mentioned by others, the location is excellent, opposite Bryant Park, close to Fifth Avenue, NY subway, midtown, and within walking to many of the iconic sights of the city. We found it very convenient.\nThe free Wi-Fi was a bonus as was the Happy Hour between 5 and 6 pm each weekday, with complimentary drinks in the atmospheric cellar bar, which we really enjoyed. We were very happy and would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a quality hotel in a great location.\nRoom Tip: Larger rooms at the back have no views but are really spacious with plenty of storage See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:07:59.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
