The lobby is the same, cold and noisy place, which you would expect for a convention hotel with lots of foot traffic. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see the renovated roooms with lots of outlets for electronic devices and a big tv in the room. It was a nice oasis from the noisy lobby, where there was no place to even sit except in the bar. Staff was friendly, and the meeting facilities were also updated. My room had a refrigerator, which was a nice touch. If you are coming for a convention you know what to expect. If you are coming as a couple or family to see NYC, there are warmer places to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:50:12.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
