We stayed at the downtown Marriott, 2 separate rooms. My husband and I had a fabulous corner suite. It was so big I said I felt like it was a NY apartment. It was equipped with a wet bar, including a fridge; 2 televisions and coat closet. The most amazing features were the extra large windows with incredible views of the Hudson. The staff was very pleasant at check-in. There is a restaurant, Bill's Bar & Burger, in the hotel. You can order take-out from there including breakfast, but there is no room service. My husband asked about this and was told that it has been difficult to get employees that want to work room service. Our sons had a room with a view of the Statue of Liberty, room 3403, it was 2 double beds but a bit small.\nRoom Tip: Corner 3308, great view of the Hudson River. Statue of Liberty view, room 3403.
