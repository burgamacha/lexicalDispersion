We had a room with two doubles but this is very small not enough room for our seven suitcases. Had to wait a while everytime we wanted tea or coffee as there was never enough in the room. The hotel was a amazing spot easy to get around and very close to time Square. Cleaner were very loud rooms were very cold had the heat on 32 and still freezing. Needs more plugs in the room and more lighting. Amazing prices we paid for the eight nights would stay again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:30:10.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
