This was a fresh concept and we decided to stay here since it was close to the Montmarte area as well as walking distance to L'opera. Its close to 4 metro stations so you can very well reach here by train but we took the taxi from Orly. The hotel is part of the Astotel chain with about 10 hotels on the Right bank of Sienna. The hotel is a cozy building on Bruyere and conveniently located near shops, eating joints and points of interest. The hotel lobby is welcoming with lots of sittign space in the dining area that is well lit by the glass sky roof. The concept is such that you will have access to the open bar in the hotel and all hotels of the chain with snacks and non alcoholic beverages served. If you manage to plan your itinerary on the right bank properly then you can have rest stops at the sister hotels and not end up famished on your walking tours of the city. We arrived at 12 from the airport and were greeted by a very friendly front desk. We had a room on the 2nd floor and were upgraded so it was a good start. The room was cozy and had enough space even after keeping a suitcase outside. The bed was a good queen size and enough sockets in the room with one USB socket as well. The bathroom has a bath and hot water was not a problem. Only quirk was the glass partition on the bath needs to be placed right otherwise the water trickles down outside the tub. Linen was clean and the toiletries were good. House keeping was good and we didnt have any problems with leaving our belongings in the room. There is a safe in the wardrobe. We had booked with a breakfast plan and it came with a complimentary mini bar. It think we were sorted with our food worries atleast for the 1st half of the day. The breakfast is again a spread of cheese, breads, savories and juices. Have the cappuccino which is very filling and we being vegetarians improvised by making sandwiches with the olives, dressings and tomato slices. The staff is polite and helpful and thoughtful with umbrellas available for guests (it did rain during our stay so it was handy). Would recommend staying here if district 9 is your choice. It is 10 minutes walk to Moulin Rouge and 15 minutes to Opera Garnier so you can cover a lot of sights from the place. Great place and keep it up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:58:45.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
