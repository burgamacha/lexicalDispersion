It's near Penn Station in Korea Town, pretty easy to get to many popular sites.\nRooms were surprisingly spacious and clean. I had a view of the Empire State Building. The price was good compared to many other hotels.\nOn the downside, the elevator was slow in the mornings around breakfast time. My room was on the 15th floor and on the first day I think I read War and Peace while waiting for the lift and was about to make a start on Anna Karenina.\nTalking of breakfast, it was included. The breakfast room was rather crowded. There was a spread of cereals, waffles, donuts, some rather tired looking scrambled egg and some fruit. We decided to eat elsewhere.\nBut overall a decent and reasonably priced hotel in a good location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:37:16.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
