I stayed here 3 times (total of 15 nights) in November and December 2016. The hotel is well maintained and fairly quiet. It was also very conveniently located to the financial sector of the city (about a 5 to minute walk to Wall street). The concierge lounge was well stocked but unfortunately there was a lot of kids running around and constantly getting in the way of business travelers just trying to get a quick bite before heading out each day. The first stay I got a room on the 18th floor with fantastic views of the statue of liberty and parts of battery park. During another stay I had some noise coming from the adjoining room. Evidentially this guy liked blasting the TV at 5AM every day. I could hear a fair amount of noise coming from that room when the TV was not blasting as well. However, those are inconveniences were minor and overall I had no real complaints. I would definitely stay here again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:49:51.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
