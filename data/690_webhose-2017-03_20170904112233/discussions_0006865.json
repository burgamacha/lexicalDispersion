This was my first time at this hotel and I absolutely loved it. I usually walk from Penn Station and this was no different. It was cold, but the walk was nice - let's face it, there's so much to see that it doesn't seem like it's that far.\nThe good: Large room where I could see \"The Ball\" to the right, bed/bedding quite comfortable, individual temp control, nicer TV than mine at home, small fridge which came in quite handy, plenty of drawer space in the closet for a few days, good lighting, walk-in shower, plenty of towels, nice toiletries, close to Subway (A, C, E lines I think), Duane Reade right next door for some snacks, Miss Saigon is VERY close, and so is Colbert!!\nThe bad: the only thing I can think of that was missing was a small coffee pot.\nI liked the street entrance (you need to use elevator to go to lobby), the bar/food area (I didn't partake, but was nicely decorated.) Everyone I came into contact with was pleasant, especially the cleaning crew - who did a fab job in my room.\nI'd be more than happy to stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:57:00.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
