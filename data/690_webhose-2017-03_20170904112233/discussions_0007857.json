The location of this hotel was perfect on a quiet street yet close to pubs, restaurants, Buckingham Palace, Westminster and Victoria Underground Station. Super easy to get around the city via Oyster card from the Victoria Underground Station. There is also a bus terminal there and the train to Gatwick leaves/arrives there.\nRooms are nice and the bed we had was huge! Nice set-up to room with ample closet space and a mini-kitchette hidden behind doors. There was a coffee maker, tea kettle, microwave, mini-refrigerator and sink plus plates, cups, silverware etc... A nice place to come back to after a long day of walking around London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:59:44.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
