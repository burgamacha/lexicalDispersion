Service was outstanding for our family of 6. We were traveling with our 3 children ages 5-11 and my mother in tow. My mother opted for their studio with a kitchen that is located a little ways down the street and in absolutely close proximity to the actual hotel.\nEvery single staff member we came in to contact with was absolutely lovely, courteous and helpful. Val especially was extremely nice and helpful. He made suggestions for Sunday Roast too. The reception area has lots of books and information on the London & Paris scene. Breakfast was provided every morning and was absolutely delicious. Their breakfast crew was outstanding and very attentive in servicing us. They also asked us if we wanted more toast when they seen it running low. You have your own pot of tea, coffee or hot chocolate.\nIt is in very close proximity to the St. Pancras Station, King's Cross Station, Underground Tube, and bus routes. Our family of 6 enjoyed our stay in their family room + studio apartment. We definitely recommend staying here and will absolutely return. We definitely left this establishment feeling safe and secured along with making new friends with the Val and the others.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:36:16.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
