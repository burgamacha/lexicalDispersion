All of the rooms are suites and they are very spacious and modern. We had a living room, full kitchen, modern bathroom and a separate bedroom. It was really great. The staff was very attentive and concerned about the quality of our guest experience. There are free drinks at a happy hour at 6 pm in the Kona restaurant that we didn't know about before arriving and we took full advantage of that while staying here four nights. Security is excellent. If you want to eat at Quillon I would recommend making your dinner reservations before arrival. The staff arranged a car service that took us to the airport and that very helpful.\nRoom Tip: Upper floor looking towards Buckingham Palace.
