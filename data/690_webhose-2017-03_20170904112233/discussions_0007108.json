Our room was small, like most in Paris, but had a great bed, was very well kept, and had a quite nice updated bathroom. The breakfast buffet is first class. This hotel also has an amazing and very helpful staff, Eddie in particular. Made us feel at home. Rue Cler lacks nothing, and within 3-4 blocks in each direction there must be at least twenty great, good value restaurants. Very quiet too.\nRoom Tip: Booking and paying well in advance produces very competitive room rates for this three star hotel.
