The overall feel of the hotel was fresh, crisp and professional yet comfortable and personable. Our room was unique and almost ethereal. We loved the cozy window seat, the clear shower with rain shower head and the dispensers of woodsy bathing supplies. So much better than the little sample sizes.\nThe service we were extended is what made the hotel stay for us. The staff truly went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable experience. We will definitely be coming back to 1 Hotel Central Park.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 14th floor where it was quiet with a beautiful city view.
