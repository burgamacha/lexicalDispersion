It is located in the flower district and the florist shops have the most amazing displays of flowers making it nice to walk down the street. The staff were very friendly and helpful at making recommendations on places to eat and visit. We were able to checkin a little early because our room was available. The day of checkout, the held our bags for us because our flight was later in the day. The rooms are large for NY. Our room had a king size bed and a couch. The bed was comfortable and came with a lot of fluffy down filled pillows. The bathroom was small, but very nicely laid out with plenty of places to put your stuff. They had a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, microwave, refrigerator and coffeemaker for your use. The television was huge. There was plenty of space to put your suitcases and clothes. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there when I return to NY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:40:58.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
