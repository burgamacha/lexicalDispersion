I usually end up at various Marriott properties around Manhattan based on price. Last week, I stayed at this property, and think I found my \"go to\" choice from now on. This property is no frills, but offers an unreal location surrounded by many restaurants, and other necessities that a business traveler looks for. In addition, staff could not have been nicer, room was clean, and bed was comfortable. Walking distance from NY Penn Station, and Bryant Park. Highly recommend for business travel, and leisure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:58:48.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
