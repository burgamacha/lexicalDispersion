Because, unfortunately, we were having hard time finding person that can speak English when we arrived at Gare du Lyon. SO, to met a nice and well-English-spoken FO woman, was a total relief :D\nSo, the hotel's location is strategic. Near the metro, near groceries store, and just by the main street. So, it was easy for us to just went across the street to buy some food, even in the late night :D - Love it. Since the other country I stayed in Europe wasn't that alive at night :D\nThe Price - Affordable. When we compared it to other hotel we've stayed during our eurotrip. Or perhaps, just because we just happened to arrived from Switzerland (which was sehr teuer), so then Paris seemed cheaper :p\nThe Room - It was large. Like a large 1 bedroom Apartment. the main room consists of 2 single bedroom, and the smaller room consist of one single bedroom.\nThe sheets were super cute! :D The heater is available in each room: main room, small room, and bathroom.\nThe Bathroom - Love it. Thy provide the standard toiletries, and oh they have bathtub! Yay! I soaked myself in the bathtub for an hour. hahaha...\nThe Food - we didn't have tie to take breakfast, so I couldn't give any review about their F&B.\nThe view that we had was amazing! I love to kept my windows opened :D\nI do love the hotel, and they still used a vintage key XD not to mention, the employees were so friendly and helpful.\nThey helped you for direction to places you wanted to go, and also if you need taxi to go to the airport or Train station, just asked them to call it for you :D\nThe wifi service was okay, not so strong, IMO.\nI'd recommend this hotel to anyone :D\nRoom Tip: Ask for the room with the view on the street. The view from your window is sooo good :D See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:05:02.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
