Upon check in as Hilton honor member i was very lucky to receive an upgrade to my room. I stayed in a executive room with access to executive lounge which it has extended to all my family that were present with me upon check in. Once came back in the room I found lots of chocolates, wine and treats and it has been a really nice touch! I felt so welcomed and looked after! Breakfast was also really good and in general members of the staff are really helpful and smiling. A special thanks to the receptionist who checked me in. A lovely stay indeed, I will come definitely back soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:56:33.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
