It is an excellent hotel and one of the best we have ever stayed in. It was very quiet considering that it is in a very busy section of Manhattan. The hotel is very warm and inviting and the staff is very welcoming, helpful and gracious. We stayed in the King Mini Suite and it was very clean,and comfortable. There were robes and slippers available, water and mints. A continental breakfast and wine and cheese are available daily. The staff called our room soon after we arrived to ask if we were satisfied with our accommodations which is unheard of. We received a voucher for parking which is two doors down from the hotel. We will not hesitate going back to this hotel the next time we are in NYC.\nRoom Tip: No preferences. Everything was superior.
