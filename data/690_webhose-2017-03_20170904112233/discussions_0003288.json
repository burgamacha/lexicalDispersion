From the moment we arrived we were welcomed so warmly. We had been upgraded due to the hotel not being able to supply balloons in my room as a birthday surprise from my sister. We had champagne, macaroons and flowers though too. Baptiste was amazing and we had no trouble sourcing advice. The staff would actually be great tour guides too :-) Our room was small but they pretty much all are in central Paris, it was very clean too and there was absolutely no noise to interfere with our sleep. It was quite bizarre how quiet the rooms were. We ventured out for breakfast each morning so cant comment on the food but I don't doubt it was lovely. Would highly recommend Hotel WO to anyone and I sincerely hope to go back in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:45:14.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
