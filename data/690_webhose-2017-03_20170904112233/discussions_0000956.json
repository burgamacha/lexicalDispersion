It is extremely central--piccadillly circus, oxford circus etc all just a few minutes away. I arrived early and was given my room, which was nice as I had flown all night before. Everything was comfortable, and the staff was kind. I did not use the restaurant (although I did drink the prosecco offered to me on arrival!). Room was not huge, but was more than adequate for one and would be okay for two. Nice lighting, bathrooms, etc. I didn't notice noise, even though it is a busy neighborhood. I would stay here again if I wanted to be in this location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:47:21.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
