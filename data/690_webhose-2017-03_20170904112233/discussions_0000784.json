It is just around the corner of subway and the landmark New World Dept store is just next to it. There are numerous 24 hours restaurants around and the noodle bar of the hotel tastes great! The output is so value for money.\nI am staying at 15th floor where have nice view and cosy setting.\nThe location is close to the famous historic spots and you can take subway there within 30 mins.\nI will highly recommend this hotel to my friends for both leisure and business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:41:52.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
