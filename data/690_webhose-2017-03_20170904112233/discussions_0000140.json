The hotel was nice, in line with expectations for a Marriott. It appears to be an older hotel, but it's well maintained and updated throughout (bathroom was very modernized). I seem to recall that there was not an exhaust fan in the bathroom, which would have been nice. Our room had a view overlooking the water, with the airport just beyond. It was a great vantage point for watching arriving and departing traffic on runways 28L and 28R.\nThe hotel is very close to the airport, which is perfect if you aren't in the mood for additional travel time after a late night flight. It would also seem to be an excellent choice for early morning flights. There is a hotel shuttle, but we did not use it, so I can't comment there. Parking was around (but less than) $30, as I recall.\nThe dine in breakfast was ridiculously expensive. The food was good, but I would not recommend eating breakfast at the hotel if you are trying to be money smart. Figure out a different option. There is a Starbucks in the hotel, but its breakfast options are more limited than a standalone Starbucks - probably to encourage people to eat at the Hotel restaurant.\nI would be willing to stay here again. I would however figure out something different for breakfast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:13:40.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
