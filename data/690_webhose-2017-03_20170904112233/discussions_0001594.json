We found it easily, arriving on the airport bus 4 hours earlier than our check in time however our room was ready so we were able to rest before setting off to explore. Hotel was very near to metro station but we prefer to walk on city visits. The rooms are very quirky but so comfortable and everything we needed was in our room. The staff were so efficient and helpful, nothing was a trouble. Excellent choice for breakfast in Cotto restaurant. I cannot find fault with this hotel and we will not hesitate to rebook when we return to Rome", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:10:17.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
