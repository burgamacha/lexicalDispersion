Only 2 of us were wine drinkers so we opted for the wine and chocolate tasting so the other members of our small group could enjoy chocolate whilst we tasted wine. It worked really well, but we had an extra portion of chocolate to share so we could taste the wine with it. Spier have put a lot of thought into the tasting as the wines and chocolate went so well together. We also had a picnic lunch, which we selected from the onsite deli. Delicious sandwiches and drinks, which we ate at the picnic tables near the river. We really enjoyed the day and ended up going again on the weekend to Segway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:42:53.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
