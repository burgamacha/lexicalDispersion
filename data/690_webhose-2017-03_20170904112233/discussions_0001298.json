Our room was small but nice and clean. I'm not sure if one can get a room with a view on the Eiffel Tower, still our had an interesting feature - we could see the reflection (the \"mirror\" was a glassy office buidling oposite the hotel) of the tower once it was lit in the evening :-) The staff was very nice and helpful and had a little furry \"helper\" hanging around in the lobby, a cat (welcomed by us, pets lovers), which in our view created a very home-like atmosphere.\nThe hotel is approximately 5-10 minutes walk from the tower, there are alsoa few metro and train stations in the vicinity, which makes travelling to other parts of Paris very easy.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:26:21.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
