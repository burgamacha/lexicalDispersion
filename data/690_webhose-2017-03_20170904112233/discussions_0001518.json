Have always stayed in five star hotels in Manhattan. This weekend in New York was all fun so decided to stay where we usually end up for shopping \\ eating. From the moment we arrived, on Friday afternoon, to a very early departure, ( 4a.m.) on Monday, everything was truly perfect. The d√©cor is so well done I bought the book \" Every Room Tells a Story \" by co-owner Kit Kemp. The food and service in both the restaurant and the parlor, ( for guests only ) which is open with butler service 24/7, is outstanding. Not inexpensive but a real treat.
