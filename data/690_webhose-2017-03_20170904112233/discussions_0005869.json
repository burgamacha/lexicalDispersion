First time stay--for business. The location is very central to Paris--walking distance to the Eiffel Tour, the metro and a number of other sights. A number of restaurants and bistros with walking distance. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, coordinating our transportation from the airport, helping with our bags and restaurant reservations, or generally just having a nice conversation. The rooms are nice, but small by American standards. The street the hotel is actually residential, so there isn't a lot of tourist activity or nightlife, but all of those things are a short walk away. In all, a very nice stay. Will stay again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:54:01.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
