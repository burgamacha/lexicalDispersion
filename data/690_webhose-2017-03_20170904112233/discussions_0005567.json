Service was excellent as well!\nBeijing is a bit of a sprawl of a city and the hotel is located within a giant mall and office complex so there is plenty of stuff within an easy walk from the hotel (and you need not even go outside if pollution is a concern).\nWill definitely stay here again next time I'm in Beijing.\nRoom Tip: Be sure to check out the underground tropical pool and fitness area!
