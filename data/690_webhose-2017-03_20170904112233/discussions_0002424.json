The location was great and within walking distance to Rockefeller Center (10 minutes) and Times Square (12 minutes). Many restaurants all around too! The price was right! The breakfast that was included was fantastic! I don't think we have ever seen a complimentary breakfast as big as this---many food offerings and plenty of seats! We really liked how you had to use your key card in order to access the floors that the rooms were on. Looked out our window to the Empire State Building. We arrived at 2pm and had to wait to access our room until the stated 4pm check In time. We will look at this hotel again for future visits to NYC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:51:05.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
