The service was impeccable from start to finish. Our room was large with a comfortable bed, some seating and a wonderful rainfall shower. A complimentary mini bar is provided for all guests with water, juices and snacks. Tea and coffee is provided in the room. I had requested a quiet room with a double bed when reserving and our room was so lovely and quiet. Large windows let plenty of light in during the morning. The hotel provided us with a lovely gift as I had mentioned we were celebrating while in Rome.\nBreakfast was excellent, with lots of choices including vegan. There was a good coffee making machine, or the staff on hand also brought excellent cappuccinos and lattes if requested. I had a self styled cheese toastie or pancakes with maple syrup most days. There was also a fruit station, hot selection of meats and eggs, cereals, pastries, panna cotta and cakes to choose from, with fresh juices.\nStaff were very friendly and helpful, assisting us to book a taxi and storing our luggage once we had checked out. Highly recommended, would stay here again on our next trip to Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:36:42.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
