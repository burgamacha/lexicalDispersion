Nothing was too much trouble for Henri the concierge with great helpfulness and engaging manners. His English is very good and he recommends good restaurants and attractions.\nLovely room with very comfy bed, TV with BBC 1 and 2, shower room, mini bar and safe. Nice toiletries.\nGood breakfast. Worth the extra cash. Cheese, yogurt, pastries, soft boiled eggs, juice, lovely fruit salad as well as bread and coffee.\nWe walked easily from here to the Louvre which has ancient walls and sphinxes as well as paintings. We also were near enough to walk to the stunning Notre Dame. Lots of restaurants nearby. Near to Seine and boat trips, the Metro and reasonably walkable to Musee d'Orsay.\nWould definitely go back to this hotel which I recommend most highly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:04:48.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
