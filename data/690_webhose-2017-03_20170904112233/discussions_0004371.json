You know, the kind you step into your own house.\nHere's the list:\n-10 minutes walk from the Rome Termini Rail Station and bus station( I'm not a fast walker). You can catch local buses from here. We took one to The Vatican. Ask the Staff at the Amalfi they're very helpful.\n-15 minutes walk to the Colosseum and the Roman Forum\n- 20 minutes walk to the Spanish Steps & Trevi Fountain.\n- 8 minutes walk to a laundry, I like to have clean clothes when I'm travelling.\nIf you want a good bed, clean environment and a good shower at a reasonable price with fantastic staff that will go that extra mile to help you. For example, our night receptionist arranged for us to have a packed breakfast to -go when we had early morning tours. ( Do let them know the night before your tour ).\nThere's also a small lift so you don't have to drag your luggage up the stairs as you would otherwise at some other boutique hotels and there are lots of them in Rome. If you want to make certain you have a home away from home, stay at the Amalfi, you can't go wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:47:42.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
