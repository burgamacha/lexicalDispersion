In our room there was a small kitchenette which was very handy. The hotel is a short stroll situated between Oxford Street and Tottenham Court stations. Very convenient to Oxford Street shopping. We had to rearrange some of the furniture in order to fit our two suitcases on the floor, as the rooms are quite small, but perfectly fine for us as we didn't spend much time in our room. Nespresso coffee in the room was lovely. If you choose the cheapest room you'll get a room with a bed against the wall, which is a little annoying but as we are young climbing over each other was fine! No swimming pools or activities, perfect for people who want to explore London and not stay in their room! Would not recommend for families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:11:27.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
