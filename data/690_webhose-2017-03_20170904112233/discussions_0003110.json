The hotel's staff were friendly, rooms nice and larger than many in such a prime location.\nThe only thing that really should be better is a need for more electrical outlets. I understand that this is a property built in 1926, but you need to have accessible outlets, including on a nightstand (standard for charging phones and other devices, CPAP machines, etc.). Even if you don't have them in the wall, you can have lamps with 1-2 outlets in the base -- it's standard issue in most nice hotels today.\nOne final comment was that we had the curve ball of waking up at 1:30 AM to the sound of water dripping, and I found that our bathroom had an inch of water on the floor and water leaking through the ceiling from the bathroom above (where the guests had apparently left the tub running...). Kind of a disaster, but the staff immediately moved us out and into a beautiful suite within 10 minutes. It was a pain to deal with at that hour, but the hotel staff couldn't help that, and the unsolicited upgrade was so nice it will be hard to go back to a regular room ever again. Likely the nicest room we'll ever experience in NYC. At least we enjoyed it for a couple of nights before leaving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:39:04.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
