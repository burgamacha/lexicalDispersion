No concerns with hot water and bath amenities.\n3) Decent breakfast although the menu doesn't change on different days. Welcome cookies were great !!\n4) 3-4 bus stops away from coin laudrette on C10 bus route towards Pimlico.\nCons\n1) Service fell short of my expectation of typical Hilton standard. A few service calls were met after a long long time. On a few rare occasions service calls were met quite promptly. A special thanks to Ms Rita who took special care of us and attended to many requests.\n2) Not too many restaurants and/or dining options near-by. Hotel restaurant was primarily provided good Western dining options. We often ordered our food from the Indian restaurant - The Coriander (two stops on bus 88 and get down at the Vauxhall station and 2 min walk from there).", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:38.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
