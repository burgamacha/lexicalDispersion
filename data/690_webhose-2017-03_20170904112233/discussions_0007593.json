The staff are very helpful and knowledgable. The location of the hotel is excellent for central London, St Pauls, the river, the Tate modern, the Globe theatre etc. A number of tube stations are close enough for an easy walk. The rooms are very good if a little on the pricy side although for London not too bad. This is our second visit to this hotel and we certainly will stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:11:54.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
