Why? We always try to stay in small, boutique hotels so the 414 meets our criteria in that sense. Susan is beyond helpful. The front desk people, whether at breakfast, midday or evening; run a close second. Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff...Susan!... even hauled our heavy suitcases up the stairs for us! Everyone was so helpful in giving advice on how to reach our destination, what sights to see on specific days and the best restaurants in the area. We're from California, we were petrified of NYC and thanks to all the advice from the 414 staff, we didn't make even one blunder. We had a great time, we even took the subway back to the airport, under their direction and it was so easy. Thank you, Susan and the staff at the 414 Hotel. We'all be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:19:12.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
