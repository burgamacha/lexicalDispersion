We had a twin room on the 5th floor.\nComfy beds and decent shower room with bath too. The room backed out onto a market place, so it was very noisy on Saturday morning!\nThe staff were really friendly and helpful.\nThe hotel was in a great location - we walked everywhere! About 35/40 mins to Eiffel Tower etc.\nRoom Tip: try and ask for a room not facing the market!
