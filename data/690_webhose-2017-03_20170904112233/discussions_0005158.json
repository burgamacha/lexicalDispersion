It is an easy 5 minute walk to Cadet which will zip you to the Louvre in no time; or Notre Dame de Lorette which will zip you to Pigalle or Concorde in a flash.\nBus #42 will take you directly to the Hotel from Gare du Nord; and from the Palm on to the Eiffel Tower.\nThe Staff (Slim, Eva, Emily, Faisel & Siddick) were all very helpful to us. They all speak English fluently.\nThere are excellent restaurants, cafes and Holes in the Wall all around The Palm; and if you get a craving for a cheeseburger just walk through Passage Briare.\nThe Palm provided the best breakfast that we had in Europe.\nWe are already planning our next vacation at The Palm in 2018.\nRoom Tip: Jus ask Slim. He will get you the best view available. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:06:06.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
