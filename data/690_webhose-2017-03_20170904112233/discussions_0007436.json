We arrived around 6am after taking a overnight flight. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel, everyone was so welcoming and accommodating. The front desk staff tried to expedite getting a room prepared for us, gave us tea and croissants and even showed us places we could go walk to stretch our legs while we waited for the room to be ready.\nOverall the rooms are small, but lest me honest...if you're here on vacation the. You are doing your best to never be in the room unless it is to sleep. Paris is for being outside...drinking great wine and nibbling on cheese! Overall a great experience!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:36:59.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
