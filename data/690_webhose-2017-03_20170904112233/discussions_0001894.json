Check in was fast and efficient a bit like a hot desk reception area . Was surprised to pay for room in full up front .\nMy room was on the 2nd floor not a great view of flats at back I would recommend paying more for a Eiffel Tower view which you can do and I overheard reception up selling this .\nRoom was good comfortable bed plenty of pillows good tv with lots of channels mini bar bath robes and good size of a city centre hotel.\nBathroom a bit dated but clean plenty of towels and shower ok. Did not eat here in the evening but went to the bar which was a bit slow in serving us but a nice large bar area with table football also.\nLocation is great for the Eiffel Tower and Saine River both minutes away and a taxi rank out front also. Breakfast was good plenty of choice and omelette cooked to order tea coffee brought to you.\nCheckout fast and efficient , if you want to be near the Eiffel Tower would recommend staying here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:00:30.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
