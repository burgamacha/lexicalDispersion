We loved the Hotel Val Girard. While I was not familiar with the 15th Arr. the hotel staff were very friendly and quick to make suggestions for nearby amenities, restaurants and bars. Our room was cozy but very comfortable, and impeccably clean. The buffet breakfast was nice. The property itself is close to metro and bus lines, and is about a 30 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it as a cheaper alternative than staying in the 7th Arr.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:50:07.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
