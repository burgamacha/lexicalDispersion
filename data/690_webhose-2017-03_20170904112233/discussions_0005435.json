The big bus stops for tours which is included in the new york pass are just round the corner you couldnt get any better. I emailed before we visited asking for a good view as my mums bday. We got 32nd floor room 3218. Was amazing view times square on your right hand side. We got 2 free drinks vouchers and a dessert in the room which was such a nice touch.
