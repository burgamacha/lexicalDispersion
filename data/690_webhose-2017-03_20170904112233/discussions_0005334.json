The front desk was friendly and helpful, except for when I checked out. However, there was no room service and the wait staff was not very friendly in the restaurant. The rooms are nice and large but furniture is worn. The beds are very comfortable. Wifi would cut on and off. We would stay there again because of room size and location, but they do need to update and somehow get room service again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:34:27.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
