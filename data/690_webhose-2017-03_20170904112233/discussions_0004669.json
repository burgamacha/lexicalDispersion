The hotel was trendy and clean. There were three elevators and a visual to let you know the location of each.The lobby had ample seating and extra outlets built into a box.\nThe room was great with Marriott beds. Our view was of the New Yorker building. We were high enough up to not have street noise.\nThere was complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. The complimentary breakfast was plentiful with many choices. It was the largest breakfast area I have seen, with plenty of seating and food and drink areas spread out for better flow. There was also an outdoor eating space (covered in snow during our visit). We didn't visit the rooftop lounge due to the weather.\nThe bottom floor, Level C, had a small coin-operated laundry room, a larger than normal hotel gym, restrooms, and a meeting space.\nWe were able to store our luggage for free.\nI noticed several different instances of hotel staff displaying rapport with one another, also rare in NYC. This speaks to a positive work environment.\nMy only suggestion is for the hotel staff to clear a path in the snow for customers who are entering or exiting taxis in front of the hotel. The sidewalk was cleared, but the curb was piled with snow, which was difficult to maneuver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:52:50.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
