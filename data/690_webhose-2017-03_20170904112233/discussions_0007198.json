I loved the architecture and the design of the hotel. The basic room is small, but the shower is nice. There isn't much sink room, but that wasn't a problem for me. The check in/out was easy. There are a lot of cozy couches and sitting areas with a nice little fire at night in the middle of the lobby. The bed and the pillows are super comfortable! The thermostat in the room was easy to use. The hotel was still under construction, but it wasn't an inconvenience although we were sad the part further past the lobby (another sitting area) was closed due to renovations. It is about 20-25 minutes to downtown Manhattan. The only downside is that there isn't really much walking distance from the hotel that we were able to experience. Will definitely stay here again when visiting NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:22:47.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
