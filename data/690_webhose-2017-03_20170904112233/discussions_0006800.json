I had asked for a room with a view. We got a view - of the building across the street.\nOnly one other fault with the room - the bathroom hand basin is not actually in the bathroom, it's in the room! A very curious set up to say the least. There is no bathroom as such just a shower (which is excellent) and a separate toilet.\nThere's adequate storage space but there's no mirror above the desk which makes it awkward for hair drying, make up, etc.(so my wife told me).\nThe food was good and the bar area and restaurant were lively without being too crowded. There was a very good ambiance in the bar in the evening unlike other hotels we have stayed in.\nThe staff was excellent. Everybody had a smile for us and they were always helpful and courteous.\nThe hotel is well situated, a stone's throw from the Tower Hill tube station. Fenchurch Street train station is not much further in the opposite direction.\nAll in all, a pleasant weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:52:20.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
