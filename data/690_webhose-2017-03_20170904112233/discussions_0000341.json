The staff was friendly, it was affordable. The property is so cute it's not even 10 minutes from the airport...so why 4 stars you ask? Hahahahaha well, when it was time to take a shower we realized we had received two body lotions and one conditioner. And we were in the far corner, so we didn't even bother to ask for shampoo. Minor thing. Also. The shuttle. Make sure you reserve two in advance for when you need it to get you there on time. They don't actually leave on time (because people, not the staff) and they are always wa over full. It's not a bad taxi ride though and the front desk will call one for you :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:01:46.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
