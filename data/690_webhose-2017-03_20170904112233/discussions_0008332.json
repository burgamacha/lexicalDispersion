Its location is fairly central in New York City so it's good for visiting attractions; sites, museums, shopping and restaurants. It's just off 3rd Ave.\nThe hotel itself is in a recently renovated building and everything feels new. The rooms are on the small side but not by New York standards.\nThe staff is friendly and helpful.\nPrice fluctuates by season and day of the week, but we found it to be better than most hotels we investigated.\nRoom Tip: Rooms are clean and neat; small but not unusually small for New York..
