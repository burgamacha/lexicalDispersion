The bathroom was a great size and modern, The only thing I wish it had was a USB port because my charger didn't work. Other than that I highly recommend this hotel, you can walk outside anytime go down the street and be surrounded by lovely people, bars, restaurants etc. in the heart of Paris", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:19:37.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
