We arrived before check in and were greeted quickly by the friendly staff. The bellman, Juan, made sure our bags were taken care of so we could start our weekend. From our arrival to our departure, he made sure we were very well taken care of. We did not return to the hotel until late that night and while the lady who helped us at that time was not very friendly the rest of the staff made up for it. They made sure we had what we needed the entire weekend. Plus the beds and pillows are sooo comfortable! Great location. Will definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:43:01.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
