I stay here each time I come to NYC and the staff are so warm and welcoming. The facilities are older but impeccably maintained. They do such a great job with kids. I've been taking my daughter since she was an infant and they've accommodated for her each time. Room service is also wonderful, offering great service and great food. The location is close to everything. Overall, this hotel is a great choice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:32:33.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
