We booked a suite which was comfortably large with views of the park below. The suite had a second half bath in the living room area which was a nice amenity. The suites are an excellent value compared to some of the competitors. The staff was very good and the Koi restaurant was excellent. The duck breast dish was incredible. I have wanted to book the hotel for some time and I am glad I finally did. There are a number of good bakeries and coffee shops nearby. If you're looking for a spacious suite at a good value look no further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:06:54.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
