The qualities I find very important are bed, cleanliness, care of facility, water pressure, and concierge. I honestly found that this hotel met every need and went above and beyond their call to duty to make sure we were cared for. Bonuses included the huge size of our room/suite and bathroom, and electronic control of lighting, entertainment, and air at the bedside.\nKal Naam was our concierge. His knowledge of all things NYC was interminable. He literally could look at us and figure out what we needed to do (first time NYC sight seer)! He easily located broadway tickets and recommended off the beaten path restaurants. We are indebted to him for our great experience. CHEERS!\nRoom Tip: We got a great rate using AMEX travel See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:20:44.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
