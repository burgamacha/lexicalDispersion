They was always willing to go the extra mile to get you the information you needed and were always willing to try and assist.\nThe room isn't very big, and the hotel itself is a very short walk from two metro/subway stations. Locally there are plenty of food options, found a couple of shisha spots, and even some trendy fashion shops amongst all the other local shops.\nVery good location for commuting to wherever you want to go, and if you ever need any extra help, the staff always very helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:03:40.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
