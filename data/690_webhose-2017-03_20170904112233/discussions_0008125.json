The price was considerably cheap and it included a continental breakfast. The (single) room itself was, as expected, considerably self-contained but everything was very well arranged, clean and comfortable. There was also an en-suite bathroom with everything working very well. The maids changed and replenished all the used soap, shampoo, towels and coffee each morning.\nThe breakfast room was very large and there always was room for people arriving, with good service and a considerable array of cereal, juice, fruit, cheese and toast available.\nGeographically, it's about a 5 minute walk from both Hyde Park (Kensington Palace end) and Paddington Railway Station. There are lots of services in the area, many bus routes and a few tube stations within a stone's throw.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:00:27.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
