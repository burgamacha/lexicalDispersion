It was the perfect place to settle in to our surroundings and was in a great location for us to go exploring China town, Little Italy and it was close enough to lots of other attractions like Brooklyn bridge, shopping on Broadway and bit farther out was 9/11 memorial and museum too.\nThe rooms were small but they were clean and they offered all the essentials we needed to ease us into our New York stay. Yes there was a bit of noise from the street below but it did not keep us up at night, it's New York City after all right?! The little coffee shop across the road was a great find too - donuts were devine !!\nThe staff at Solita SoHo hotel were lovely, very accommodating and always a genuine smile on their face and interest in how your day was.\nThe price for the room was very reasonable for what we required from it. We enjoyed our stay here. Thank you Team Solita SoHo !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:51:26.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
