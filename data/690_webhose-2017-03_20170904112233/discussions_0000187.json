This hotel in Soho was, for us, a perfect location. We were even able to walk to Big Ben and Parliament from here, though we did use the tube and buses quite a bit -- and Uber. There a many really good restaurants nearby just 2-10 minutes walk. Our room, though compact, was plenty adequate for our week in London. Actually, with the mini kitchenette, we were able to breakfast in the room most days and keep a few refreshments in the fridge. We even pic nicked in the room one night (there is a Whole Foods Store close by.) The front desk was friendly and helpful. Wifi worked fine and the hotel was in a quiet location. All in all a great value and superb location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:11:28.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
