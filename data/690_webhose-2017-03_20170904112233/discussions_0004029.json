We chose the location for its ease to the subway-14th Ave is only a couple blocks away which made it easy to get around everywhere we needed to go. The hotel is also one block south of a Korea town street that has some delicious, cheap eats. The hotel is clean, smaller foot print without all the frills. Expect the rooms to be small, New York sized rooms, nicely laid out to try to get at much storage space as possible. But while in NYC, I hope you're only in the room to sleep at night. The foot print of the hotel means that you are in close proximity to the elevators, but we didn't experience any excessive noise from them (there are only 2 and you will wait a little). There is a small bar and a food option but we didn't take advantage of them. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. If you are flying into Newark, this hotel is ideal, just take the NJ Air train ($13) to Penn station and walk 2 blocks to the hotel. Also know that \"view\" rooms simply mean you get to see the street and may have some light, not that you get a view of the city.\nRoom Tip: There is a rooftop deck with a beautiful view of Empire State building-go up, especially at night!
