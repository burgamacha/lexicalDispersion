Our check in was so relaxed and welcoming, and after a few hectic days before vacation and a sleepless night on a plane it was greatly appreciated. They offered us water and coffee, and it was perfect. The staff Julian, Pierre, Ennui and Antonio were so very helpful, genuine, professional and knowledgeable. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are well appointed and the bathroom was somewhat spacious (in comparison). We immediately requested a second luggage rack and we managed just fine for the 4 night. It is a great area and close to everything we wanted to visit and do. We will definitely return and recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:00:23.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
