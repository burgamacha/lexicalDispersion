All hotels should provide this facility it really was a fantastic touch.\nBreakfast was nice and a good spread to set you up for the day.\nI really couldn't fault this place and would 100% recommend to anyone visiting Paris.\nWould definitely return if we come back to Paris in the future", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:34:03.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
