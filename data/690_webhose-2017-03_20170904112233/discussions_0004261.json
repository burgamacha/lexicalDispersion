It's right near all the Broadway theaters, shopping, restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is clean, neat and the staff is more than accommodating. They also offer a voucher for the parking lot across the street for $26 for 24hrs if you choose just an overnight visit like we did. The rooms were a little small but clean.\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting New York city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:35.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
