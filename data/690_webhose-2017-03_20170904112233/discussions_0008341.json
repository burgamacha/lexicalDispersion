We had a double room with a balcony and it was spacious and beautifully decorated. We had a coffee machine in our room and all the drinks in the minibar are complimentary, so we enjoyed our refreshments on the wonderful little balcony overlooking the square. The staff is very friendly, you get free afternoon tea and cake at all their hotels in Paris and the breakfast is sumptuous! A wonderful experience!\nOh and the beds are great and the windows make sure no sound comes through from the main road even though we were facing it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:17:27.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
