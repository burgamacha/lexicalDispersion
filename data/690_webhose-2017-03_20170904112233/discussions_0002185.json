We booked the hotel last minute at a great rate for New York. The hotel was in a TERRIFIC location - near Grand Central and Broadway. Easy to get to - we walked everywhere except when we went to Lincoln Center when we took a cab- and we felt very safe walking in the area near the hotel. The room was small but comfortable. Bathroom was updated and bedding was very nice. We were near the two elevators so we had a little hallway noise while folks waited for elevators, but we didn't hear a peep from any rooms around us. Our only challenge was the heat was through a small unit that also provided air conditioning - we didn't figure that out for a while and when we finally turned the unit on, it was really too loud to keep on while trying to sleep. Thankfully the bedding was extremely warm and comfortable but late night trips to the bathroom were definitely chilly! Overall a great place to stay and the convenience couldn't be beat. Lovely offer of morning coffee and tea, and apple cider in the afternoons. I also understand the hotel offers walking tours when the weather is nicer. Desk staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:08:40.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
