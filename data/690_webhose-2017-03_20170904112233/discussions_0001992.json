Just me and my wife chose the premier king suite. The view was amazing from the 16th floor. You could hear the sounds of the city just enough for it to be enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable! They helped us out with everything from great local eating places to how to get around in the city. The continental breakfast was filling, complete with hot and cold items. However my wife and I chose Chick-fil-A two blocks away most mornings.\nThe Empire State Building is two blocks down and one block over. Entrance to the Subway (34th and Herald Square) was just two blocks away. Macy's, H&M, Forever 21, etc are right at the subway stop. Times Square is just one more stop down on the subway (2 min ride). The location was perfect!!!\nThe rooms made great use of the space allotted to them. Although they were quaint they didn't seem cramped. They were very clean all the way down to the remote control. The cleaning staff was kind and helpful!\nThe only downside was a clanging noise that came from the elevator shaft. The noise could be heard every time the elevators moved. It was not overwhelmingly loud and did not keep us up at night but you could hear it in the room. Again, the front desk provided us with earplugs when we called down to ask about the noise.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York!\nRoom Tip: Best views on the 16th and 17th floors See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:00:44.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
