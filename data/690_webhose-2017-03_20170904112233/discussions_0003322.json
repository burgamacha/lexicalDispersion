From the Gare de Lyon railway station, it was very easy and fast to travel to the George V Metro station. Emerging from the south side of the Ave. de Champs-Elysees, the hotel was only 50 metres away on a side street.\nVery warm welcome by English-speaking reception staff, small (20 m2) but very nicely furnished room, comfortable wide bed, nice bathroom. Breakfast was normal for this class of hotel.\nVery well-located for Paris tourists and business visitors. I would come back here!\nRoom Tip: I had no problems with a room on the busy side street. Little traffic noise. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:44:37.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
