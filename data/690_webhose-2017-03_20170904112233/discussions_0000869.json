From the moment we checked in at the Front Desk, we had a very warm welcome by Maximo and Bien with a delicious Tiramisu! Since we booked our trip through Costco Travel, we were upgraded to a 2 story, 2 bedroom, 2 baths, 1 full kitchen and living room apartment! We were a bit shocked and of course happy! Thank you! It was very cozy and accomodating, it felt like home away from home! Maximo was very imformative and Bien who was very helpful, he took some time to tour us, in \"the apartment\" and was just a happy guy who enjoyed his job! During our stay, we've met few other staff in the breakfast room, Barbara and Rose! They were outstanding and very personable! Took their time to meet us and chat! I've also noticed, they would greet their other guests by their names, (maybe frequent guests) which I thought was important because, come on, who doesn't like to feel important? Just another plus! Food was amazing, fresh omelettes, eggs, espresso/cafe latte made to order and Barbara's special daily baked bread/cakes! Thank you to all the staff! We've really enjoyed our stay, it was more than what we expected the trip to be. Also, the location of the Hotel was a +++! Centralized to everything!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:17.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
