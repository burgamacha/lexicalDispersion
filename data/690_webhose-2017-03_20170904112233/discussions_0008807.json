It is in a fantastic location and you feel right at home after a busy day touring London. The staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and comfortable. We felt very safe there. We really enjoyed the hotel bar and lounge area. They have a fabulous piano player who plays Wednesday Thursday and Friday evenings. The concierge was so friendly and helpful. We could walk to the underground station, wonderful pubs and restaurants, a grocery store, galleries, museums, parks, and more. Our room was comfortable and clean. The shower was fabulous. Having the breakfast included downstairs was a very convenient way to start the day. We would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:13:14.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
