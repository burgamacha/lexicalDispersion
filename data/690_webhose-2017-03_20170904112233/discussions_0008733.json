We flew in to Luton airport so it was just one train (no changes) to get to St. Pancras Station from Luton Airport Parkway (24 minutes). The hotel was just a few minutes walk away. We arrived early on the morning of Saturday, March 18th, 2017. Although the rooms were not yet ready we were checked in by the friendly and professional Katalin at the front desk. She stored our bags and had them delivered to our room before we arrived back in the afternoon. We requested a room on a higher floor. The best room available was on the 11th floor - an adapted room for guests with disabilities - we took it. The room was very large with an extra large bathroom and excellent shower. It was very nice - clean and comfortable - with a great king size bed. Very large window with a good view - although I would have preferred a room at the front of the hotel with a panoramic view of the City of London - next time :-)\nVery nice hotel and a great location. Just minutes from three train stations giving easy access to the Underground and overground transportation.\nThe only negative (very minor) is not enough electricity/power sockets near the bed for charging phones/cameras, etc.\nA luxury hotel but we found a great deal online.\nWill hopefully stay here again.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:43:41.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
