This hotel is a great option if you're on a budget or just not into spending a load of money on a hotel room. Especially in Paris where you will definitely spend the majority of your time out site seeing!\nThe rooms were clean and the hotel staff were very helpful. We experienced up to 3 different staff members and found everyone very obliging and helpful with our queries. The hotel is located near several metro stops so it is so easy to get around. Definitely use the metro while in Paris, it is an excellent way to see all the sites. There is also a delicious bakery across the street from the hotel!!\nI would recommend this hotel for a Paris break and would definitely book again if I was returning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:35:59.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
