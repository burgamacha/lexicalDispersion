Aside from serious faced staff, although polite, this hotel was amazing and I loved it. I had a single room on the first floor. It had a large single bed (possibly a small double) sumptuous curtains, a mini bar, luxurious bathroom with toiletries, complimentary slippers, large tv, dressing table and chair.

All in all, a well deserved treat and I loved it. Just smile more, fellas! Oh so serious! Lol.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room not by the kitchen fans!
