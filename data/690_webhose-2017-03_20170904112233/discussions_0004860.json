We checked in our luggage in the front desk . They told us to get lunch and comeback .when we came back they told us that they upgraded our room to the view of the Eiffel Tower without any additional fare. The hotel was across the train station so, It's easy to hop in and go. The room was just right for us , bathroom was clean . The breakfast was good. We stayed on Jan 2016 , for 4-5 day I think to celebrate my husband birthday and our 30th anniversary . Overall stay at this hotel , I will recommend it .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:00:16.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
