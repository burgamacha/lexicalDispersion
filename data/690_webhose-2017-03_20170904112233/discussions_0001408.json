Simply put, this room, the hotel and their delivery of services make the Hotel Scalinata di Spagna possibly the best value around this area period.\nHaving stayed at the Hotel Hassler many years ago, my overall experience here has actually been better so far. Honestly, the formalness of Hassler gets old for the traveler that wants to get up get out and fly. Here, the people are nice and they have been highly available and responsive to my questions on just about everything. They are truly terrific.\nThe room I am in is incredible with a near 360 degree view of Rome complete with a large deck space equips with patio furniture. It's so fabulous if I had friends I'd throw a wine party. Not sure this is allowed, still, it's that wonderful.\nThe buffet is complete. They have fresh baked bread, morning meats, yogurt, cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage and best of all an all day available espresso, chocolate, capachino machine that does everything.\nWe have a fridge in the room for stuff we bought at the campo di fiore which is cool, it keeps it and chills the wine too.\nSummary\nIf you understand Rome then you know the value for which I speak. All these features just make for a real life experience with perks. It all works here. Now, consider I have this too and I am not staying in the rest of the hotel. I love the staff I have met so you get them staying in any room. You won't get a gym like that of the Hassler, but the deck is so big you can do yoga to the sunrise in semi privacy (other rooftop people might see you). If you make use of the breakfast, great, or go to the Cafe Greco cause it 80 yard away down the Condoti.\nYou can use my name, email them. Massimo has been great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:25:16.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
