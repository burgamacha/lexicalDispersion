I thought the price was great considering it's so well located on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The hotel is a short walk to Strawberry Fields in Central Park.\nWe stayed in a Queen suite with our 3 year old daughter. After the long days out and about in the city, we were able to put her down in the bedroom in the evening and hang out in the living room. Next time we will get a King suite, because the bed was a little cosy with the three of us! There was however, a sofa bed in the living room.\nThe kitchenette was useful, though we never cooked in the room. Always handy to have a fridge! We also used the laundry room (almost unavoidable with a toddler), I was so happy to have it in the building.\nConsidering this place is on a busy street on the Upper West Side it was very quiet.\nWe will absolutely stay here again.\nOh, they also offer free internet which is a big winner in my book!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:02:03.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
