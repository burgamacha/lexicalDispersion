Breakfast was good and a lot of choices.. wifi is fast and the rooms were very stylish and all in concept. Location was very okay as well as it is just a walking distance to Montmartre and very near to the Lamarck metro station and the bus #95 so you can go whenever you wanted to go. Around the place a lot of restaurants to eat, shops and even bakeries when you wanted to buy something. We had a great time staying here thanks to Declic Hotel ‚ù§", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:33:51.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
