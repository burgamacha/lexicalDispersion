I'm staying here from March 12-18. I looked and look to see which hotel to pick first time in London and just fell in love with this hotel. It's soooo close to everything the London Eye is right next to it Sea life also Bod Ben boat cruse everything even the bus right in front. Hats off to all the staff here. You know everyone that works here look up at you and say Hi with a smile. I especially LOVE it when we come from visiting sites the front door staff says \"welcome home\" love is when after breakfast the staff tells me \"Have a nice day Mr. Silva \" it's the little things your staff does that make a BIG DIFFERENCE. Keep it that way and this hotel will have guess coming back. Thanks for all the things y'all have done and will be doing. One bad note a/c went out the first day we stayed but the staff was real quick to check and move me to another room. Thanks for quick response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:17:40.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
