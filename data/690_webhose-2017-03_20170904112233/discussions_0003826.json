I first stayed on the 4th floor, then extended my vacation and moved to the basement. The rooms are small, but I have stayed in smaller. It was a handicapped accessible room (which I didn't request). The floor of the shower was dirty- ground in dirt most likely from wheelchair tires. When I did complain about it, they came right up and scrubbed it out. So, the service was good. It was perfect for just me.\nThere are refrigerators in the rooms which is a plus!\nThe breakfast was very good! Included were: waffle maker, scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon, baked goods, toast, yogurt, bagels, hard boiled eggs, juices, bananas, and apples. Oh, one thing I have to add- I tried cereal with milk and it didn't taste right. Then I looked over at a cart that had gallons of milk on it-sitting out for a while, covered with a sheet. I saw this everyday. Do not drink the milk!\nI loved the location. It was on 44th close to 9th were there are a multitude of restaurants on 9th (restaurant row).\nI would stay here again, but not the basement room I had (104). It was next to the elevator and across from the \"work area\" for employees.Their phones were constantly ringing and it was loud.I wore ear plugs. I also kept the curtains closed b/c the room looked into the area where the garbage dumps are.\nI do have to say that I was given the Tripadvisor price while extending my stay plus the desk woman gave me 10% off. So all in all, I would recommend this hotel minus room 104.\nRoom Tip: Make sure not a basement or handicapped room.
