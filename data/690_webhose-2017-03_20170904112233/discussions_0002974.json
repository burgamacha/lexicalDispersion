It's only one block away from the Tuileries Garden, just outside of the Louvre, and in very close range to the Place de Concorde, Christmas markets, and such. I anticipated a typical Renaissance, but this was nothing like it. It feels far more like a boutique hotel as it is far smaller than what one would normally find, and what a difference in noise one block from a major road makes! You feel comfortably tucked away from it all, while still so close to everything you might like to experience. The staff was beyond helpful with any needs that we had, including one terribly early taxi ride to the airport. The bar was also exceptional, and hidden away during the day to the point that I didn't even know it was there until it opened!\nMy biggest regret was that we were only able to stay one night, but I very much look forward to returning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:14:20.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
