Only 30+ rooms makes it really intimate in every way. Small and refined reception with great staff and doorman. Small refined bar area cum lounge that offers great service and style.\nThe rooms are elegant and modern. We took the junior suite with lounge area and bedroom, only curious part of the layout was the separate toilet away from the bathroom. Beds are super comfortable, quiet rooms and excellent Japanese bath.\nBeing Paris, the prices are crazy expensive but normal for the city at this quality level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:00:21.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
