Also, there is always a weird smell downstairs and on the staircase, and the lift is claustrophobic.\nBut that'd be it when it comes to downsides - apart from that, everything is fine with this place. The metro station (Pigalle) is just around the corner, which makes the location awesome. Sacre Coeur is just few steps away if u climb up to Montmartre. The rooms are good enough for few nights stay, and the personnel is really friendly and helpful. Excatly what you can expect for 2-stars standard and the price on booking :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:42:11.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
