So I suggest staying here, particularly if you are inclined to eat in as it is close to the Breguet Sabin Metro Station which is less than 200 metres away. There is an excellent fresh food street market running between the metro station and Bastille each Sunday and Thursday and there are a couple of Supermarkets a couple of blocks in the back streets either side of the Citadines. As the metro is so close it is easy to go to other areas to eat out. We had a one bedroom apartment on the top floor at the back of the Citadines and this was excellent. We used their laundry as we had been travelling for quite some time - just purchase tokens from reception. The other plusses for this place is that access to the building is via your room key so there is a good level of security and also tea, coffee and hot chocolate are freely available in the foyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:35:56.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
