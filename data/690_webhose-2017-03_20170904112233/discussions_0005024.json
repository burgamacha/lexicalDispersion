We had a big two bedroom/two bath suite with a living/dining area and full kitchen. It was a corner unit, so we had some fun views through our many huges windows - Broadway, 75th street and a peak at the Hudson River. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were very small, but clean and functional. With the windows closed, it was very quiet and a we slept great, especially for NYC. There is no valet parking or restaurant on site, but there are parking lots very nearby and a great diner/cafe a few steps from the hotel entrance where you can sit and eat or take out to your room. There is a large supermarket across the street and a wine store on the block - both with a large variety of goods and so convenient. This was our first stay, not only at the Hotel Beacon, but the upper west side. The area is more residential and peaceful than our usual mid-town location. We walked to the Museum of Natural History and a few great restaurants in the area. Perfect place to stay if you're seeing a show at the Beacon Theatre. The staff we met along the way were all very helpful, pleasant and friendly. We'll definitely be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:02:47.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
