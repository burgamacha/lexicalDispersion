It's perfectly located between Times Square and Central Park. You get the advantage of being close to the action but not inside it. The surrounding is full of places to grab coffee or quick breakfast, also the dining options are endless. Also Avis being next door is a plus if you need a car for a day out of town. The suits are very generous in space and amenities. The concierge I must say is top notch with heads on advice and getting you tickets to sold out shows. For me whenever I'm in NYC the London is the place to stay in.
