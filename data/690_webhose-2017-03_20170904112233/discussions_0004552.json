Everything about our stay was enjoyable and the service we received was smooth with no problems. This hotel has its own unique style which makes a change from the usual boring bland hotel rooms you get with the major chains.\nOur room was stylish and comfortable with an amazing shower and massive bed. My only negative comment is that the walls were a bit thin so we could hear doors slamming in the corridor but other than that, I recommend this hotel to all.\nAs soon as we came out of the metro station (Charles de Gaulle Ã‰toile) the hotel was literally just round the corner - we could not have chosen a better location as everything is on your doorstep, supermarkets, cafes, metro station, the arc etc etc.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:38:57.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
