But the front desk staff were impeccably kind and professional. He very kindly negotiated with the housekeeping to have our room ready in just a few minutes. Thank you Alin!\nIt really made a huge difference to us and was a nice start to our stay.\nApart from that the hotel itself is nicely kitted out. We took basic room but it was amply sized, temperate, secure, well furnished, and equipped. No complaints at all. A very pleasant stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:43:43.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
