Can't recommend enough...will be staying again. Location was just perfect aswell. The address is 1717 broadway and you are literally a 2 minute walk from time square. 5 mins from central park with excellent eateries all around. Great shopping nearby. Hotel staff can't do enough for you. Lovely bar and restaurant on the forth floor, breakfast is served on the 3rd floor and is amazing. I particularly enjoyed making my own waffles! The hotels decor is very fashionable also and everywhere is spotlessly clean. Stay here, you won't be disappointed.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:33:05.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
