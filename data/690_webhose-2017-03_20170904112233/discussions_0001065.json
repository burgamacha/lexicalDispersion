We booked 2 interconnecting rooms and the set up was perfect for our family. From the moment we arrived, when we were given an early check in, to our last day at the hotel we were treated like royalty. Breakfasts in the Dining Room were superb (especially the Burford eggs) and our dinner the first night was excellent too. A special shout-out to our concierges, who made many arrangements for us, and our footman Harry for the wonderful complimentary cocktails he made for us in our rooms each evening and the lively discussion about anything we wanted to know about London. It will be very difficult for us to stay anywhere else the next time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:03:23.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
