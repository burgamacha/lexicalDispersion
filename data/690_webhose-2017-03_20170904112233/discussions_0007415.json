The rooms are super tiny, but that's standard for New York and it feels pretty cozy. The room was clean and had no maintenance issues. Staff was professional and we were able to walk to Central Park, the Empire State building and Times Square. They also have breakfast and 24 hour beverages. Hotel itself is great, but if you use the parking garage that they partner with, beware. Get the rate and departure time in writing. When we dropped our car off they said we'd get the discount rate from staying at the hotel. When we picked it up, a different guy was working. He charged us $40 more than the other guy said and claimed he knew nothing about the charges because he only works one day a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:39:34.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
