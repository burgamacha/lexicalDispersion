The hotel is situated near the Champs-Elysees and the metro. This location is walking distance to all the nice restaurants and shops. The staff were polite and efficient. The room itself was modern but small. The bathroom was clean and well decorated. We did not have breakfast in this hotel as it was not included. Overall, the location was great but I had expected a better room for the price we paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:21:15.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
