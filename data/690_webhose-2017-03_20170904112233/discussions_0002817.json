The hotel is positioned in the middle of a busy street in the middle of the Montmartre district. The building is beautiful, with a classic, central-parisien look and feel to it. The interior is nicely designed, with nice and bright colors.\nThe rooms, although small, are well maintained and clean. All the basics are there; a comfy bed, aircon and a small desk with a kettle to make yourself some tea or coffee. For the pricerange, this hotel offers more than enough comfort and beauty to give you a 'Paris' experience.\nA tip from us: we used Paris' public transportation system to get from the airport to the hotel, which is a real pain with luggage. For the return trip we used the hotel's shuttle service, which was very comfortable, and not expensive!\nThe staff are extremely friendly and very helpful, with tips and tricks to get around the city. What a lovely time spent here! Will visit again whenever we return to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:39:52.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
