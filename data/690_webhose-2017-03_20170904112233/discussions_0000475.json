Eugene was a great resource, helped us out (in English) finding our way, gave recommendations, and helped with some printing needs. I can't remember the lady's name that also helped us out, but merci to her as well! The hotel is in a great location with access to several metro stops, including the RER B from CDG airport. The room was small, but that was expected for any room in Paris or major cities. The shower is wonderful - the jets are so nice - really do give you a great massage!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:02:40.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
