Right from getting out of the cab to the last time i walked out of the doors the helpful and courteous staff was there with a smile. The Hotel is industrial / Steampunk posh...Beautiful property with old time wood panels and chicken wire safety glass mirrored closet walls. Old photos of local attractions adorn the walls. Old fashioned wall lighting and a tiled bathroom right out of the 30's-40's. Big Dark and beautiful adornment galore...one of my favorite Hotels.\nRoom Tip: walking distance to Mott St. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:09:47.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
