The Renaissance was conveniently located to the business district as well as a 5 minute walk to the Metro. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. The staff was extremely pleasant and attentive. The rooms were beautiful - we stayed in the Renaissance suite ( 2 adults and a teenager). The club lounge is perfect - very large and newly renovated. I highly recommend getting a room with access to the club lounge. Getting to Paris was so easy and it was nice to come back to a quite part of town. The Brasserie restaurant was also very good, the staff was great. The Renaissance exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back.\nRoom Tip: Stay in a room that has access to the club lounge - worth the extra money See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:24:46.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
