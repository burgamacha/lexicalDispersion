Great staff. Very service oriented and always available to help. I had as all problem with my room and they upgraded me to a wonderful room on the18th floor. A very neat theme. Very natural feel. A lot of stone and wood incorporated into the construction. Definitely feels more comfortable that \"standard\", cut and paste hotel chains. Very neat, recycled themes through the hotel. I found it interesting my hangers in the closet contained love letters and hold maps!!\nThe elevators can be a little slow during peak times during the day.\nBar is great and the food is good. Breakfast can be a bit pricey.\nOverall I have really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to friends looking for a slightly different atmosphere, comfortable and very friendly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:11:39.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
