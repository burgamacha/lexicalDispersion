We were greeted by the desk manager upon arrival late at night, he was very friendly and offered great advice! The hotel found out it was my birthday and sent a lovely bottle of champagne to the room.\nThe Superior Suite was perfect: clean, cosy and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean and the shower was amazing.\nThe location is fantastic, many sites are within walking distance and many buses can be found nearby.\nOverall, this hotel was fantastic! I would definitely recommend!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:33:54.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
