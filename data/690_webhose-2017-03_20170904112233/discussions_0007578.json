It was the perfect location for a downtown New York experience and a work trip. The hotel room was absolutely beautiful and pristine. I loved the decor and all of the toiletries in the bathroom. A really cool and unique feature is that you are able to do everything you want from your personal Ipad- order food, set up a room cleaning, etc... I loved being able to order food the night before and wake up to a knock on the door with a lovely hotel staff member with my coffee and breakfast. Also- the coffee they offer is La Calombe, my favorite in New York. Also- get the Avocado toast.
