My only regret is that I didn't have time to use the indoor pool and sauna.\nDue to its central location there are numerous and varied eating options nearby. I especially enjoyed Connolly's next door, where you can also enjoy live music. All the major theaters are within walking distance, as are many top sights and the subway.\nThe best part was the staff who were fabulous and made the stay even more comfortable and fun (special hello to Marc!). Happily, I'll be visiting NYC often for work and I'll definitely stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:15:57.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
