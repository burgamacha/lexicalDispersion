No frills and not very fancy but a well run and well maintained small hotel. Our room (15) was not too small by Parisian standards and had a small balcony, overlooking the quiet street. Location is not central but very convenient with all modes of transportation and with plenty of restaurants and services near by. The room was comfortable, very clean and everything worked as it should. Breakfast is good and very reasonably priced. We have stayed in many small Hotels around Paeis and this was one of our favorites, We certainly shall return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:08:58.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
