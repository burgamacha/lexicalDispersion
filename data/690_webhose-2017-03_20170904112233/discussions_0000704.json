The boutique style of the hotel ensures that the staff really gets to know you- we were greeted by name whenever we stopped at the front desk or walked in through the front door.\nWe began our stay when Thomas at the front desk gave us a tour of the property, which is both beautiful and charming, even pointing out their pet cat who you may see out in the garden. We were shown to our room, not just given a map or directions on how to get there, like you may get at other larger hotels.\nIn addition, Christian and the rest of the concierge team were so helpful in finding us wonderful little bistros around the city for dinner- every single one that we tried was delicious. They even recommended places to see live music and offered to get us museum tickets if we needed.\nOur stay here was more than just a place to sleep in between our sightseeing in Paris- it was like a second home. It felt so much like it that my husband and I actually caught ourselves saying, \"when we get home\" when we meant returning to the hotel.\nAs for the property itself, it looks like a French Chateau, complete with a cobblestone driveway, in a quiet residential area of the 16th arrondissement. Our bed was comfortable, the claw foot tub in the bathroom was amazing, and our view overlooking the center courtyard fountain was gorgeous! The hotel is a short walk to the RER and the Metro, with quick access to all the major sites.\nI cannot recommend this hotel enough. You will love it!\nThank you Thomas, Christian, and the rest of the Saint James Paris staff for helping to make our first trip to Paris a magical one!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:07:52.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
