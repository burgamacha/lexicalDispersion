It is an older style hotel with lots of interesting quirks and charms. Our room was very large and comfortable and very clean. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was, considering the location in the heart of the city! Breakfast was excellent, with lots of variety. The hotel staff really went out of their way to be helpful. The only problem we had was trying to cool the room - we were there the first week of March and they were not able to provide air conditioning in our room, as apparently the heating system is central. However, we slept with the windows open and were fine. The location is excellent and we walked everywhere and when we needed a taxi the hotel got us one within a few minutes. Our stay was a good value for the price and we will stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:52:17.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
