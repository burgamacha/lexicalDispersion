My visit was for just 2 nights and I was catching up with a great friend whom I hadn't seen in 10 years. At checkin we were upgraded to the most amazing 2 bedroom suite complete with butler, fully equipped kitchen and view of the courtyard below. The location was superb - walking distance to Buckingham Palace and close to the St James tube station. Will definitely be back to this incredible hotel again! Thank you to all the wonderful staff at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites who made this brief trip so memorable!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:23:07.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
