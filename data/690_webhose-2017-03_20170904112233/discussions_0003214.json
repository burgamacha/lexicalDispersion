It is located in close proximity to the Champs-Élysées – Clemenceau metro stop, which is also a major bus hub. We had no problem navigating and most of the time walked to many of the major city sites.\nWe stayed three nights and the room we had was clean and non-smoking. It had a separate shower and bath tub from the toilet. The wifi worked perfectly, however there were only 2 or 3 English channels (BBC and some other news channel) on the TV, which we didn't mind because we weren't really in the room. We did hear our neighbors occasionally, but again, didn't mind too much because we didn't spend a lot of time in the room.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:31:17.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
