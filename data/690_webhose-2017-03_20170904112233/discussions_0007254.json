The staff are very attentive and helpful. My room was extremely comfortable and clean with a lovely marble bathroom. I had supper in their cozy bar area and while it was a bit on the pricey side, the food and service were top notch. After a day of walking around London, it was very nice to be able to have a light supper in the hotel. As a woman travelling alone, I felt completely at ease in this Hotel. I would definitely consider staying here again.\nRoom Tip: Ground level room near the kitchen may be a problem if you like to sleep in.
