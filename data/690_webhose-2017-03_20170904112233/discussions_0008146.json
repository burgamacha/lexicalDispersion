Booked a few months ahead for bargain price of Â£53. Short distance from London Bridge Station and in the very vibrant Borough Market area.\nEasy check in using touch screen which dispenses keys in seconds. But staff there if needed.\nRoom was large (with a sofa bed we didn't need). Spotlessly clean. Gorgeously comfy bed and a real bonus for me was the completely black out curtains - did not wake until 8.30! No noise at all to disturb sleep.\nProof that Premier Inns are providing what people want at an affordable price.\nHighly recommend it here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:40:10.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
