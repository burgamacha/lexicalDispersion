I have never stayed at a friendlier hotel. Each staff member I met, including housekeepers in the elevator, greeted my husband and I with genuine smiles and wanted to be sure we were happy and had all we needed. The hotel is historic but inside, brand new and beautiful. There is an espresso machine in the lobby that makes cappuccino that tastes like Italy. Our bed was luxuriously comfortable and we had city street view in our room. It is about a block to the baseball field, the Peabody ducks and Rendezvous BBQ, and a quick walk to Beale St. We never got out our car. The rate was very affordable for downtown. I can't imagine why anyone would stay anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:22:37.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
