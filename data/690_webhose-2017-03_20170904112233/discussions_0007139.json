We needed a hotel for Sunday evening in March. I know the reputation is very good but as a guest , it was sensational.\nMy 13 year old ( who loves a good hotel ) was in awe of the friendly staff, cool red elevators with great music and an overall terrific vibe. We initially had a lovely room with an interior view. When I asked if there was another option, we were able to move to a room with a view. Miguel and Sharon at the front desk were extremely accommodating. They made us feel very welcome. The room was , well designed, crisp and clean and the bathroom was amazing . We didn't want to leave. I look forward to our next visit and will highly recommend this hotel. Great staff and management is as important as the accommodations. Here , you get the entire package.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:05:10.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
