When we arrived the room we had requested (a family room with 4 separate beds) had not been prepared as Booking.com had not passed the instruction on. However, the reception staff were fantastic and sorted things out whilst we enjoyed a complimentary glass of prosecco. We were absolutely delighted with the spacious room that was arranged for us and had a very happy stay. Thanks to Sarah on reception and to her colleague whose name I didn't catch, who not only checked that we were happy with our accommodation, but also went out in the cold to hail us a cab whilst we waited in the warm! I will definitely recommend and will come back another time.
