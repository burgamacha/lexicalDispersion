Due to unforeseen circumstances, we couldn't spend our first night here; however, we were given a free drink whilst waiting for a taxi to take us to the partner hotel. Once there, a room wasn't ready but we were given a complimentary glass of sparkling wine on the roof top terrace whilst we waited. When we checked out the next morning, our luggage was transported to the Diocleziano whilst we went out and enjoyed Rome.\nWhen we arrived back at the Hotel Diocleziano after a great day in Rome, we found we had been upgraded to a room with a roof terrace and our bags were in the room. The room was great although the bed was rather hard. One word to Doreen on the Reception desk and this was sorted for the next night.\nAll the staff we came into contact with at this hotel were well spoken and polite. Many thanks especially to Doreen, Emilio and Lavinia who were really helpful, recommending places to eat and sorting out the issues with the room. They helped us really enjoy our time in Rome.\nWe had a great stay and would recommend this hotel without reservation.\nThank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:28:52.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
