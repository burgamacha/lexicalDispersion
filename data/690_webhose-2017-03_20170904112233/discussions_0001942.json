Its place in BEIJING is the best we can expect: on Nanluoguxiang, close to Shishahai which seems to be the best area for fun from both chinese and stranger people opinion about fun in Beijing. The service is not only excellent, it is above excellence: kind, efficient, we get every answer to our questions about anything, the place is clean, with bar, fridge, web, ticket service, roof plaza, every good advice about travel in Beijing, around Beijing (their trip to great wall is really he best I ever experienced and I know my way about that!), and everywher in China, there is bathroom in every room (it is different from hostels with dirty bathrooms in the back of courtyard!), etc...\nOn another hand: my job is chinese language teacher , that's the reason why I take my 17 years old students every year in beijing during autumn, and I take them every year to Beijing Donwtown. To that day, 141 17 students came there. Their opinion about this hostel is the same: they are so happy to come there! So Happy! These french students, some of them never came to China or any other foreign country all say the place is clean, pleasant, with a so original decoration, and is the very best point from which discover Beijing. At the same time go to modern China with bars, shops and best known clubs like \"Mao live\", and at the same time, discover pleasant and quiet \"old Beijing\" and hutongs, these silent narrow steets we cannot imagine among this so busy city of Beijing. My students are happy, it is not from me but from this so kind and efficient people at Downtown who opened to my students the most beautiful door to China!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:20:12.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
