I picked the Hotel de Londres Eiffel because I found it in Rick Steves book, the good reviews (tripadvisor, google, etc) and they had availability for my dates. I was not disappointed. I arrived early and found my room ready. A great bonus as my flight was a red eye and I was traveling with my 15 year old god-daughter. The room (Cozy Poets room) was clean and well equipped with a closet, safe and small refrigerator. The rooms are small by American standards and I did hear noise (nothing earplugs can't fix) but we found it perfect with enough room to be our home base as we visited the City of Lights. A short walk to the Eiffel, we were able to get many great pictures. Metro, RER and bus stops were a few short minutes away. But the best part, the team that runs the hotel. They were friendly, attentive and always willing to give suggestions. And of course we can't forget Samba, the resident dog. In all a great stay and I highly recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Email the hotel and let them know what you are looking for, they will deliver if they can.
