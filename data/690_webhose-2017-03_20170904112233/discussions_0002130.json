Impressive as this is, it's also a drawback, since there are only three elevators: plan your day strategically! The rooms are compact but comfortable and quiet. The bathrooms are a little too compact: nowhere to put one's toiletries. The location is interesting, just two blocks from the Stock Exchange. One or two blocks from six or seven subway lines. A few blocks south of the World Trade Center site. Handy for walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. Overall, a part of New York that might give you a new view of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:25:22.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
