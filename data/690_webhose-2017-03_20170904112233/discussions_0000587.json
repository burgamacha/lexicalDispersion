Molto Bene!!\nTake yourself a few short steps off the Piazza de Popolo...and you are staying at a very adequate and well priced hotel. Breakfast room is top notch and the service in the morning is excellent.\nWhat I liked:\nStaff Excellence- Folks like Giorgio take pride in what they do and take it upon themselves to do a better job for the customer than expected...they all have this trait and show a lot of confidence.... plus Giorgio turned us on to some excellent food finds and treats.\nCleanliness.... is next to godliness... and this hotel is CLEAN.... and if something is wrong they are falling all over themselves to fix it.\nProximity - right off the piazza is a great point of destination... close to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain...or a slightly longer walk to Piazza Navonna... and of course a short ride to the Vatican... located in a great neighborhood that is quiet... on a street that isn't incredibly busy\nWhat i didn't like:\nTrash- (not at the hotel but down the block) the city needs to take more pride in keeping up with the trash at the entrance to the Piazza and the train landing near the hotel... too trashy...\nNoise from the train- yeah... i heard it more than once...but then again its what you will find all around the EU...\nDid it beat expectations - 100%.... a lot better from the inside once i got there... and very welcoming for families...\nWill i go back... YES... as long as the staff keeps up their commitment to me having a great stay....\nThanks from all of us on how well you did on our trip to Rome...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:02.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
