Confirmation emails , and multiple offers of assistance , some of which I took advantage of and always dealt with quickly and efficiently.\nOn arrival the tone was set by Dane the doorman , so professional , polite but also welcomed you as a long lost friend . During our stay he continued to be a real character and a great ambassador for the hotel . Indeed all the staff could not have done anything more to make the stay faultless. You are constantly acknowledged , and greeted by name , how they do this is beyond comprehension . You very quickly notice the ratio of staff to guests is very high . Whether is was in the cocktail bar , or having afternoon tea or in the restaurant , I if you wanted something they were there , almost before you asked . I cannot fault one single point. The food , in the restaurant , is just incredible . I will not run through the actual food , but it was the best , quality , flavours , and experience I have had . The way they blend and match different foods , sauces and flavours was so creative and it worked every time . We made one mistake , eating one evening at the Savoy . Huge mistake , food no where near as good as the goring , and the levels of service not half as good . We had the queen bedrooms , which again were fantastic , and the marble bathrooms super . Lots of sumptuous towels etc. We will be back , and very soon I hope !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:03:31.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
