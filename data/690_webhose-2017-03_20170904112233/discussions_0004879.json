We arrive early on Saturday, we are greeted by Cecilia, certainly one of the most professional concierges I have ever met, who has our room ready so we could already check in. The lobby is very stylish and confortable, with a complimentary coffee and refreshments area as well as a 'Honesty Bar' (you make your own alcoholic beverage and write what you had on a form so they can charge it to your room). The rooms themselves are very confortable and super clean. The shower is really amazing!\nThere is an amazing good vibe to the place. It's very hip yet extremely cozy. Very well located, walking distance from the Marais and Bastille areas. The metro is very near.\nIt was an amazing weekend staying there. We look forward to come back soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:39:12.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
