It is an old building that has had the interior modernized. The people at the front desk were very helpful in helping us see various of Paris. We stayed at the Cecelia for 5 days prior to going on an Insight Tour. The rates were reasonable and breakfast is included. As long as you do not need eggs, just about every other breakfast food was available - yogurt, granola, croissants, pastries, cheeses and ham were among the choices. The hotel is also within walking distance of several fine bistros I will be reviewing. The Cecelia also has free WiFi so I was able to listen to news reports from a station back in Wash D.C. along with checking email etc..", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:37:35.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
