Updated rooms, air conditioning, mini fridge and even heated towel rack. Ten minute walk to the termini train station and hop on and off bus stops. David greeted us and was very friendly and pleasant. Great complementary breakfast. My two complaints are 1) the water would be nice and warm and then get cold for a minute and switch back to warm. This would happen off and on throughout my shower every day regardless of the time. 2) we had a triple room which was a nice large bed, not sure what size and the third bed was actual a sofa that had the cushion flipped over for me to sleep on which was extremely hard and uncomfortable. The tv was also right above the sofa so it was very uncomfortable for me to try to watch.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:46:53.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
