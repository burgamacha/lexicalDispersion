I emailed the hotel a couple of weeks before to request a higher floor and they didn't disappoint. We were on the 37th floor(top) with amazing view of the WTC and Brooklyn Bridge. The room was spotlessly clean and the kitchen really useful for breakfast and to rustle up a quick meal in the evening after a long day sightseeing. The location is great for all of the midtown attractions and close to the subway for those further afield. Staff very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:25:50.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
