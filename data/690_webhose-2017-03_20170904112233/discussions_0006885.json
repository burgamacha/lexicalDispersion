However at our first arrival, we began to feel that things were quite different for the better. Receiving staff was immediately helping us with valet parking and baggage, well dressed and friendly. The lobby was busy but efficient and elegant. Our room was beautiful and every aspect from lighting to bathroom layout was designed with convenience of the guest in mind. Location in midtown was excellent. We had walking access to Times Square and Central Park ,hundreds of restaurants and the MoMA is right across the street. This 4 star hotel has the classic elegance of the past while provding (except for free internet, the only downside) everything expected of a 4-star hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:39:02.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
