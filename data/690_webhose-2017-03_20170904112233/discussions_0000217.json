The front desk staff were very friendly at check-in and even upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. The suite was good sized with a separate sleeping area, a large and comfortable couch and two comfortable chairs. There was also a dining table and large flat screen TV's. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room. The beds were comfy, the room was quiet and we were allowed to park our car there while we were gone. Shuttles run every 30 minutes to anf from the airport.\nRoom Tip: Try to get a suite. They are great!
