This time I travelled with four of my friends and previously with my wife and other couples. This hotel suits all. It is in a great location within easy walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and, indeed, numerous other attractions, metro stations and excellent restaurants. Rooms are exceptionally clean, with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower from several of them. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Looking forward to my next visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:21:48.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
