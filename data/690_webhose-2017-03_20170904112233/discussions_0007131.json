Old, quaint and quirky but in a fabulous location. This hotel has amazing staff, I cannot praise them enough, they were great, always helpful, friendly and professional at all times. We managed to secure the last room in the hotel and when we booked we were advised that the room was quite small. However it was perfectly adequate for us but I liked that the hotel advised us of this. The breakfasts were superb and we are here one evening and had a delicious meal. Well done to the kitchen staff. Will definitely return to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:09:00.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
