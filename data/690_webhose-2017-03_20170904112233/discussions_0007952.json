After this visit, I have found my favourite hotel so far: St Martin's Lane Hotel. I felt I liked its modern, clean, distinct style upon entering the lobby, and that feeling was reinforced when seeing more of the hotel, including the room. Fresh, clean, stylish with interesting, fun features all around. The service was furthermore excellent, from check-in, to the cleaning, to the bar and to the breakfast. It is correct but relaxed. The wifi system is excellent: one simple login needed for a weekend stay, and it was always fast, reliable and free. I particularly liked the (standard) room: Great style (again), with nice products interior design. The location is, lastly, ideal for any visit to central London, with a five-minute walk to the Leicester Sq. tube station. I warmly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:20:28.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
