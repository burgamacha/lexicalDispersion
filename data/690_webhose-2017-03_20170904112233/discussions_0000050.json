It sits in a cove area (if they call it that in California.) So the water extremely tidal. In the morning there were dolphins swimming. There is a nice sidewalk great for running to watch the dolphins while you run. By 9 the tide is going out and the back area gets that wet mud smell. The area is pretty quite and the rooms are spacious. There was a bit of confusion when we first arrived as the front desk thought we were part of the work group/convention who were having a buffet lunch and we were directed we could have lunch in the main area with them rather than just directed to the M lounge. So make sure if they are checking in lots of people at the same time to clarify your stay. Other than that hiccup our stay was very nice. The back patio has a fireplace and comfy chairs that we were able to sit down and enjoy drinks while talking over our day.\nRoom Tip: ask for a view of the water See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:29:54.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
