The staff were amazingly friendly; from the moment we were greeted by the doorman, to the friendly, professional service at check in. The front desk staff are young, helpful and friendly. Location is everything in New York and this beautiful hotel is situated in a great part of town. Shopping and restaurants are in walking distance. While it's tempting to get out there and see all the New York has to offer - make sure you use your feet and walk around Soho - the shopping is some of the best! We enjoyed the ambience of the Soho Grant. The hotel lounge is really lively in the evenings but is also a great place to unwind or have a drink before a night out on the town. Really nice for breakfast too if you're tempted to stay in. We found it to be a good base for our short stay in New York and made us feel a touch glamorous too. Well worth it and would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:09:29.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
