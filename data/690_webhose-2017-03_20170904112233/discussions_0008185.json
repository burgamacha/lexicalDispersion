The room contained two large beds and a sofa and armchair. Also has a nespresso machine and kettle. Bathroom is nice size with walk in shower, no bath.\nRooms were clean, and well kept.\nOur package included breakfast in the executive lounge. This included hot food- scrambled egg, bacon and sausage. Also available were pastries, fresh fruit and fresh juices with a self service coffee machine. Tasty fresh food and pleasant staff.\nThe gym is great, with plenty of treadmills, weights and other machines. The pool is also very clean and great for lengths. Changing rooms well kept with free lockers to store your stuff, you get given a key card to access these to remove the key.\nIt's s five minute walk to the nearest tube, just across the bridge is Westminster station on the jubilee line.\nWould definitely recommend staying here, location is great for visiting all attractions and cost cab from Victoria train station is roughly Â£10.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:17:12.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
