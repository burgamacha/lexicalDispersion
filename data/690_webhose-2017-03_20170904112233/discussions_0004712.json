I arrived early Wednesday morning and Brandy who works the overnight shift greeted and told me she was expecting me. Since I was extremely tired this was music to my ears, she checked me in quickly and since a high floor (my preference) wasn't available she upgraded me to a King Suite. I was a little concerned since the suite was on the second floor but you know what I didn't hear much noise from the street at all. I was working evenings in Manhattan so when I returned late at night Brandy was there to greet me and ask if everything was okay. I highly recommend this hotel it is convenient to Manhattan and at a Queens price which is a really good value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:37:16.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
