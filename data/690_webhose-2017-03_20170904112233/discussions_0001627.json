The highlight was the wine tasting room, Marlon who served us was wonderful. Amazing views but not from everywhere, so ask for a room with view of the mountain, with patio and refurbished. Buy wine from the wine tasting room and pay corkage at the restaurant as the price of it is doubled at the restaurant and the other bars. Amazing view from the spa. The cellar tour was a disappointment. Completely non-informative. Could have been so much, especially with such rich history of the estate. Lovely picnic area, get basket from the deli. I would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:48:02.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
