Still I would like to give couple of advises to increase the value of the property (not increasing the price hopefully, it is high enough).\nFirst thing sauna in SPA is too large and maybe therefore could never reach reasonable temperatures of 80 grad Celsius, but only 50.\nIt would be good to have more than one key for room.\nlast but not least - we once ordered a dinner for 12 in their dining room. The waiter's service was good but meals were either just OK or bad. Also for money they charge you it is easy to get much better meals in Rome. They serve also their own wines - red is rather good, white is on much lower level. I would propose to owners/management to change catering as one would expect much better food in such a good hotel.\nRoom Tip: prestige room is very good See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:26:22.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
