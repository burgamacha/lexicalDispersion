Perfectly close to the train station where you get off at. Is only a 5/10 min walk to hotel (somehow we took the wrong turning and took us 40 mins ) once in there, you step into a large marble entrance and the room was spacious, clean and pretty. We stayed in the classic double room and it was a great size. We got breakfast included in the deal we found, and I would defo recommend getting the breakfast as well. So much choice of delicious foods to choose from. The main sights to see are all in walking distance which is great :) we just went for a walk and stumbled upon the coliseum!!
