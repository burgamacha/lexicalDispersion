We are Marriott rewards platinum members and were very pleased to receive our complimentary upgrade to an executive level room which included access to the executive lounge.\nUpon arrival, after flying overnight from the US, it was wonderful to visit the lounge and be greeted by Samuel-aside from being very friendly and welcoming, he kept the lounge well stocked and clean. When we were headed out for the day he made a point to walk us down the hall to point out some places that we may want to visit during our stay. It was so nice to see his smiling face each morning!\nOur room was quite large by European standards and well appointed. A very comfortable king bed, both an espresso machine and coffee maker and ample towels. The room appeared to have been recently renovated.\nWe ate at 16 Haussmann on the Sunday evening that we were in Paris as there are very limited restaurants open on Sundays. The food was good as was the service.\nThe hotel is less than 1 block to the Metro and there are plenty of taxis.\nI would highly recommend a stay and plan on staying here the next time we are in Paris!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room at the end of the hall and on a higher floor.
