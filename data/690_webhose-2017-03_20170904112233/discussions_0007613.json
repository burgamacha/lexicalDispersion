Spacious studio apartment. Everything you need is supplied - except an electric kettle. Full fridge and freezer. Coffee and tea available 24 hours in ;lobby. Great breakfast, but not much fruit.\nVery friendly helpful staff. Place runs like clockwork . This was our second visit and would recommend highly.\nJust 200 yards from 39th Ave subway station. Easy access to Manhattan, Times Square etc. quiet area.\nWill definitely be back.\nRoom Tip: All rooms are excellent.
