It has been described as like a Premier lodge and I have to agree with that description. The beds are comfortable and the room is an adicate size. Internet is not free in the room but costs 2.95 a night internet is free in the lobby. The subway is two blocks away and the subway from JFK airport stops there. There is a hotel bar next to the lobby and restaurant serving Mexican food. There are 4 Deli's across the road. The staff are pleasant and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:19:46.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
