I didn't know wellness/fitness themed hotels existed when I started looking for a room to spend the impending NYC blizzard in within walking distance of the Javits Center. From a friendly yet quick check in when I arrived exhausted Monday night to small kindnesses throughout my stay (loaning me a stapler, a folding table and some photocopies) the front desk staff were top notch! Annie, Jon & Andrew went above and beyond to ensure my every need was met. The hotel concept is fantastic but it is the flawless execution that is just incredible and really impressed me. I consistently thought \"this is great, but would be even better if they x/y/z, only to discover moments later that my x/y/z thought was already in place! An example--behind the front desk they offer several infused filtered waters (the ginger-lime was addictive!). As I filled a plastic cup during checkin, I thought \"Ugh! I wish I had a refillable water bottle with me, I'm sure I'm going to go through a million cups while I'm here\" . And what greeted me upon entering my room? A cheerfully bright orange EVEN branded waterbottle! They say the devil is in the details but this hotel has those details figured out! I adored having a yoga ball in the room, it became my desk chair, that is when I wasn't using the standing desk! This was a business stay for me and I set up my dream workspace in my room. After hours in front of my computer, I used the foam roller and yoga mat in my room to stretch my back. The bathroom! Who doesn't enjoy a rain shower head? Again the details! This time, luxe touches that just elevated my entire experience.Not only EO products in the shower, but full sized bottles! No need to hunt down the housekeeper and beg for extra conditioner here! The there was Cork & Kale, their on premises restaurant. The food was excellent and the menu full of healthy choices. I had, loved and felt good about eating the frittata, the Nicoise Salad and the eggplant & tortellini dinner. Another plus for this caffeine fueled traveller (beyond the in-room keurig) at C&K there's 24 hour, self service freshly ground and brewed coffee available in FOUR varieties! In summary I loved it there, didn't want to leave and will be back soon!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:11:28.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
