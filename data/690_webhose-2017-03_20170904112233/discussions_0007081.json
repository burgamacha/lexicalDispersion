Wasn't too pricey...paid about $310 for the stay. Parking added another $110 to the bill.\nTo access this Residence Inn, you must use the 4 Maiden Lane address. We pulled up to the entrance and used the valet ($55 per night). We arrived early around 1230 and were able to check in immediately. The front desk attendants were friendly and explained everything as needed.\nOur room was equipped with a King Size bed, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, sink and dishes/utensils. A long desk with chair and small ottoman. The bathroom was a nice size with a shower. The room was big enough for 2 people. This is probably the cleanest Residence Inn I've ever stayed at. I'm a Marriott member and have stayed at many Marriott properties and this location was pretty immaculate. The cleaning staff were very nice and friendly as well.\nFree breakfast was available from 7am-10am. The usual menu included: waffles, fruit, scrambled eggs, scrambled egg whites, pork & turkey sausage, biscuits/gravy, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, pastries and muffins. Juices of course. Coffee and hot chocolate available...especially for the cold and windy days in NYC.\nI read a few complaints about how long the valet takes to get your car. But we only waited 10-15 minutes. After checking out of the hotel, we wanted to do some more shopping & site seeing, but we didn't want to carry our luggage and we didn't want to drive in the city. We asked the valet if they could store our luggage and pick up our car in a few hours...they agreed with no hassle.\nThis location is in walking distance to the Charging Bull, World Trade Center area, Oculus, Eataly, Century 21 and a plethora of shops and restaurants. Park your car and get your walk on. Very easy to get an Uber to any place that's a little further away.\nGreat job Marriott and thank you for an enjoyable stay. Other Marriott properties should model themselves after this location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:18:40.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
