There is tight security to enter the street because it is near the US Embassy, I recommend if you arrive by taxi to have your hotel confirmation letter handy.\nThe arrival experience was quite lovely, there were a selection of infused water available. Vintage couture gowns were decorated all around the lobby and reception area, quite fitting for the fashionable locale.\nThe room was very chic and stylish, modern technology where you need it like a USB port near the desk as well as a power outlet at 110V for North Americans.\nThe bathroom was also stylish, Hermes amenities, double sink, a large walk-in shower with rain shower head, separate deep soaker tub. The lighting is a little dark for ladies who want to apply precision make up.\nBreakfast buffet was extensive, great selection and fantastic quality.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:25:46.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
