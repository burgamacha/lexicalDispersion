I got there late at night after a flight delay and there was a friendly receptionist who had my details ready and I had my room key and directions to my room within seconds. There was always someone on reception whenever I walked through it throughout the weekend. The room was very clean - spotless actually, with a lovely modern bathroom with decent shower. Teas/coffee/milk were replenished every day and the room tidied, bins emptied. The hotel was quiet even though its not far from main roads. I didn't have the breakfast so can't comment on those. On the last day they were happy for me to leave bags in a secure room after booking out while we were out for the day and we collected them later - with no extra charge. Overall an excellent experience and I would not hesitate recommending the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:47:21.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
