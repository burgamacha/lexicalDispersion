Although the children did grumble about the 10/15 minute walk to the tube station (London Bridge). But it's not that bad\nThere is a restaurant attached (Thyme) which looked to do the typical lunches/evening meals. This is where they served the breakfast. As always our son loves the all inclusive breakfast.\nWould recommend getting to breakfast either early or late as when we came out from eating (9:30/10:00ish) people were queuing to get in.\nThere is a Papa Johns pizza place across the road and a mini Co-op shop which is handy for those mini supplies.\nLuggage storage was absolutely no problem.\nThe room was very warm. We ended up turning the AC off and opening a window.\nAlthough we didn't use it, there is a car park adjacent the hotel. Roughly £15 for the night. Don't forget your congestion zone payment (£10/11?).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:55:56.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
