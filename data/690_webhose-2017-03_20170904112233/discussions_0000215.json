Average property in good repair with a great and engaging staff. Room was spotless with good lighting and multiple outlets and USB charging stations (Yes! Finally someone realises we need more than 1or 2). Shower and amenities were solid. Fridge in the room was a nice surprise. Cookie (yum) and water provided upon arrival (water is a nice add to weary travelers). Not sure this would be a vacation location...but solid and convenient for business travel. For those with an early flight...roll out of bed, drive to return rental car and be at check-in/security in about 30 minutes. To the management: kudos to Charliann for being a star performer.\nRoom Tip: Ask for bay facing room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:47:40.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
