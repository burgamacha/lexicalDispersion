I was in for a surprise when during my check in, Ms Marion stepped out from behind the counter to gave me a warm welcome and told me about my free room upgrade. As I checked in in the morning and I have to wait for a while, I was given a complimentary welcome glass of champagne to go with my lunch.\nFrom checking in to checking out, I have no problem at all. All the staff were friendly and accommodating. I was delighted to have a chat with familiar faces in the restaurant too. :)\nThank you for taking some time off to chat with me. I would also like to thank one of the staff who offered me fresh croissants and coffee at 4 am in the morning when I was waiting for my ride after checking out.\nThank you all for making my stay here a wonderful one. Till we meet again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:25:06.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
