The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean. We stayed in a suite with 2 adults and 2 children. We were all very comfortable. While we enjoyed the neighborhood and were glad the hotel is centrally located in the city, it is not very close to any certain tourist attraction or area. This was good for us because the area was pretty quiet but with smaller children we found that we were often having to arrange transportation to do as much sightseeing as we wanted to do each day. Most places are within a 20-30 minute walk or a 10 minute taxi ride.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:36:09.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
