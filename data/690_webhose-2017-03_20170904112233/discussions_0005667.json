We were early and knew a room would not be ready just yet. The staff stored our bags while we went ahead and started sight seeing.\nRooms were rather small, but the decor and quality of the finishing made up for it. Small kitchenette which included a small fridge, sink, plates, utensils etc was much appreciated.\nWe were very happy to have chosen this hotel given the location to some of the sights and it's convenience to Victoria station. We took the Gatwick Express train to get to our next destination from Victoria.\nGreat little pub just around the corner from the hotel. The Phoenix in Victoria. Great fish and chips and good brews on tap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:07:47.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
