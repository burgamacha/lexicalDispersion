Location is top notch as is the service and the cleanliness of the rooms whilst breakfast is always a treat in the courtyard. Only slight con, which is really a function of the great central location is that the noise can be a factor. This time around we could hear early morning refuse collection whilst last time, we had a rooom on the ground floor which was adjacent to a staff area which was quite noisy. Overall though, thoroughly recommended but perhaps ensure a room not on the ground floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:58:41.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
