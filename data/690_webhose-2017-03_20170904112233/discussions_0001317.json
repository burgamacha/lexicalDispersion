Subway station right araund the corner, and bus stop right outside the door.\nYou have litterarily hundreds of restaurants within the same 10 mins radius.\nThe main road passing the hotes has a lot of traffic, but were not bothered with it at night. We had a corner room, and it was nice. A bit small perhaps if you are planning to stay for a week or more, but with everything you will excpect to find in a hotelroom and it was all working. Staff in reception are very nice and welcoming. They all speak fluent english (as to my surprise did a lot of the people we met in town). Breakfast was good, but a little excpencive. All in all recommended.\nRoom Tip: Recommend a corner room.
