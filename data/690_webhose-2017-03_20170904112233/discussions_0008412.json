Staff were friendly and reception clean and bright. Our room was clean, modern and well equipped with TV, phone, iron, great shower and lovely towels. Very convenient location to London Underground/London bus routes and for a budget hotel at an excellent price, would highly recommend. The only set back to be aware of is the very badly designed open wardrobe/clothes shelf which is a Health and Safetly hazard. It is very poorly designed with a lethal corner that sticks out and unfortunately my wife gave her head a very hard whack with it and it is still very sore 36 hours later. We let reception know when we checked out yesterday morning so hopefully the hotel will address the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:21:47.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
