The hotel is beautiful and the attention to detail and cleanliness throughout is fantastic, the service levels are fabulous, every one greets you and makes you feel wonderful, the hotel itself is beautiful, we enjoyed a swim every morning in the rooftop pool, love the way it looks like a yacht. The bar is comfortable, trendy and has fabulous service,enjoyed the DJ in the evenings, we loved it!
