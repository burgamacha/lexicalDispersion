This time we stayed in room 51 that had a small balcony (w/table and chairs) and great view overlooking the street. The en suite in this room had a bathtub. The bed was super comfortable. On our last visit we had trouble connecting and staying on Wi-Fi during our visit: this was not the case this time.\nThe front desk staff was super friendly and helpful. A few of the employees recognized us from previous visits which made use feel special.\nAs I've said before, the location of the hotel cannot be beat. The hotel is only minutes from Notre Dame, The Louvre, and Sainte-Chapelle. The Chatelet metro stop is at the end of street, as well as a taxi stand. The RER train to Versailles is less than a 10 minute walk across the Ile de la Cite to the Left Bank. If you are travelling through Gare de Nord, the hotel is about a 10-15 euro taxi ride away.\nAnd if you cannot live without your Starbucks, there is one 2 1/2 blocks away.\nI definitely recommend this hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:22:01.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
