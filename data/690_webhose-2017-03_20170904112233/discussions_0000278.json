Nice room, comfortable bed, large bathroom, good wi-fi in room. Superb breakfast (including egg dishes, yogurt, cereals, fruits, juices, pastries, sausage, etc., even smoked salmon). Nice location in upscale but very urban neighborhood, very close to subway station (Piazza Barberini, two stops from the Termini railway station) and 5-20 minutes walking distance from major tourist attractions. I received excellent restaurant recommendations. My five stars mean: 100% satisfaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:35:09.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
