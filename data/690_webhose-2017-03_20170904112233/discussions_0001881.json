We arrived on the day that Orly airport had its terrorist attack. We were on the runway there for 4 hours having flown in from Southampton. I e mailed the hotel to tell them we'd arrive later than planned. They replied and then on arrival at the hotel they'd upgraded us and we now had a room with a lovely small balcony.\nOn the downside the lift could be slow, the wi if wouldn't let me in at first as there were too many users, and on my side of the bed there was no light switch BUT the charm of the staff, the fact that the hotel was so well placed near the excellent St Quentin food market and close to Gare du Nord plus the excellent breakfast made me give this 5 stars.\nWould recommend and would be very happy to stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:08:28.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
