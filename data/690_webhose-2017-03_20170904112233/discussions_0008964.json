Sitting in the bar having a warming alcoholic hot-chocolate after a hard day of shopping and sightseeing is the perfect soothing balm to your soul!\nThe location is pretty good: close to Grand Central Station and all the main tourist locations, such as Times Square and Fifth Avenue are within easy walking distance.\nRoom quality is ok for Manhattan - not huge, but not shoebox size. Some of the rooms could do with updating but the main thing is they are clean and the beds are very comfortable.\nAdmittedly we've never eaten at the hotel apart from having breakfast a couple of times in the bar area, which was reasonably-priced and adequate.\nWifi is available in the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:30:40.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
