The hotel was so easy to get to, we actually walked it from London Paddington, as this allowed us to walk through Hyde park, and it was wonderful. Upon arrival, check-in was easy, and the staff were very friendly. The hotel is currently having a bit of work done, with scaffolding outside, but this did not take away from the character of the hotel, and it's charm. Breakfast was very good, we went for the continental included in our package, which included different cheeses, hams, and sweets to try. We visited the natural history museum the next day, which was about a 5 minute walk from the Hotel. Overall, the hotel has a great location, in a nice area of London, within easy reach of everything you need, and right next door to Hyde Park! Would go back in a heart beat.\nRoom Tip: Very top floor have very quiet rooms- floor 4 or 5 See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:32:52.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
