The staff were very welcoming and let us check in early. Since we were there as firefighters, we had a tons of bags and bunker gear and air packs to check in. They were very accommodating and recommended where we could park our car. Every time we walked past the desk to enter/exit, they greeted us with a smile and wished us a good day/night. The best part was that they secured all our gear even after we checked of the room so we could claim it later in the day when we picked up our car. I highly recommend this hotel. It is directly next to the World Trade Center and a short walk to the Subway. I'm definitely staying here on my next trip to the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:23:12.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
