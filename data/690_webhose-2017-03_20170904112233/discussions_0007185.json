It was quite large. However, it had a somewhat dated appearance, and seemed to need renovation to be commensurate with the rest of the hotel. In addition, there was also a mild septic smell that persisted in the bathroom.\nWe must also comment on our experience at the bar. We returned from dinner wishing to have a late-night cocktail in the very beautiful, lush, warm and inviting bar. We were the only patrons when we arrived. The bartender seated us with the proviso that we would need to complete our order within 25 minutes, as he was about to close down for the night. We took our drinks. During the next 15 minutes 3 other couples entered the bar and were told that they would need to order in the next 10-15 minutes. They stayed, but the procedure should have been more inviting. Doesnâ€™t the hotel want the business?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:29:48.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
