We could not have been happier. The staff was wonderful - very helpful, kind, and informative.\nThe morning breakfasts were great - service very quick and friendly and nice selection of fruits, cereals, yogurts, cheeses, meats, and pastries.\nLocation was very good right next to the Pantheon - you could just pop in at any time. The square and surrounding area was very lively, and a number of great places to grab a bite nearby. The hotel was very helpful with suggestions that were just fantastic.\nThe room was very nice with a little private balcony. Seeing a partial view of the Pantheon was a treat.\nWe loved this hotel!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:13:09.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
