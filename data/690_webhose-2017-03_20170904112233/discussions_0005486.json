Everything we needed for our stay in NYC. Room is a good size and while it could maybe do with a picture or two to cheer it up, it had everything we needed. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was modern (no shower curtain as is so often the curse of mid range American hotels) and spotlessly clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Easy walk to Little Italy, Lower East Side etc. and both Grand Street and Canal Street metro stations are in close proximity. The only things we weren't keen on were the handkerchief sized towels and the patchy wifi (even though they tried their best and put us next to the IT room). Otherwise it was ideal, and we'd definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:31:55.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
