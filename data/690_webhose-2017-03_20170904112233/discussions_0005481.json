It was a bit hard to find but definitely worth it! Very cute and clean hotel, good breakfast. The girl in reception was great, she spoke good english, was very friendly and helpfull. We booked the tour to the Great Wall with the hotel and everything went well.\nThe lounge area is very cosy, nice just to hang around if you have lazy days in Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:19:31.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
