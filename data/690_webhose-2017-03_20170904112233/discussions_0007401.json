This location is nestled in arrondissements number 10. From the airport, the taxi driver warned us about this being a bad neighborhood. It most certainly isn't. My husband and I felt comfortable walking through the neighborhood whether day or night. This is a very diverse area of Paris, which for me is all the better! The hotel staff was very helpful during our stay, as we did not have any issues to complain about. My only gripes are the room size and smell of the bathroom. The room is tiny--like smaller than the size of a room on a cruise ship. This was only an issue when my husband and I returned with tons of shopping bags. We made it work. This wasn't a problem for us but may be for others. Also, I could not tolerate the smell of the bathroom. The smell wasn't that of sewerage but just very odd and intolerable. Overall, my stay was great and I'd most certainly consider Hotel Brady Gare de L'Est for future stays in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:02:59.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
