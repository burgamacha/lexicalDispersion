We really enjoyed it! The room we stayed in was nice and clean. The location is great. The subway is right there and you are able to easily walk to Wall Street and to the boats that take you over to the Statue of Liberty. The hotel is located literally right next to the World Trade Center Memorial and Museum which was nice to see everyday up close and personal. When we are back in NYC we will definitely be back. Also, I accidentally forgot my iPad in the room which I realized when I got to the airport. I called them up to let them know about my misplaced iPad once I got through security. They found my iPad and I had it back in my hands in 2 days, which I appreciated greatly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:30:46.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
