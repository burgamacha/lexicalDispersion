The hotel is within walking distance to all the sites and the terrace offered us the perfect place to enjoy our late afternoons to watch the sunset! The room accommodated three adults, was very clean, modern and gave you the feeling you were staying in your own apartment while visiting Rome. The owners were great host.... Always warm and welcoming! Highly recommend this place and the suites! Thank you to everyone at the Hotel Scalinata for making our visit to Roma perfect!\nRoom Tip: Get the Panoramic suite!
