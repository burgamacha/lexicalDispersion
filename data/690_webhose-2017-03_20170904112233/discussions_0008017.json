It's situated on a nice, not too busy, street with lots of shops and restaurants & a pub close by. Very close to tube station and bus lines that get you across town into the main tourist areas of Covent Garden, West End, Trafalgar, Houses of Parliament, etc. I loved strolling the lovely neighborhood and 2 blocks to Kensington Garden and Palace. I felt like a temporary local. My studio apartment was large and very nice. I will always stay here when I return to London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:52:17.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
