The hotel has been recently updated and didn't disappoint.\nFirstly the hotel is very easy to access from the metro with just a 200 yard walk from Cardinal Lemione station.\nRooms are excellently appointed and beautifully decorated. We were on the 5th floor with view across he amphitheater at the back. Lovely big bathroom with walk in shower. Plenty of wardrobe space and big comfortable bed. L'occitane toiletries were a lovely addition. Everything was spotless.\nThe hotel staff are very helpful and courteous. Check in was a breeze and they booked a taxi for our return trip to the airport €75 for a large people carrier for the 4 of us.\nBreakfast was a nice continental selection and plentiful. Lovely breads and pastries and a small hot selection.\nThere is a small but nice bar area with an honesty bar. A glass of wine was €5 so good value.\nThere were a few bistros nearby and a small supermarket and Boulangerie so well equipped.\nA nice walk (or route march) to Notre Dame and you're in the midst of tourist spots. A great location and would definitely go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:57:47.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
