Rooms are noisy - but only from outside. New York drivers use their horn!!! I didn't hear other guests even once.\nMy only complaint would be the strong smell if the cleaners that are used some days - but the windows open (!) so you can air your room out.\nRooms have a bath. The well stocked minibar tops off a pretty good room.\nRoom Tip: Get the Chrysler Building view!
