We only had 10 days in Manhattan and wanted to make those days count, the Row Hotel seemed an obvious choice because of its location. Only a block away from times square, the best that Manhattan has to offer is only a short walk away!\nUnlike most hotels the beds are so comfortable which is just what you need after a long walk on the streets and the heater works instantly which is a must if your used to the warmer climates (Like Australia).\nIf by chance the weather is too miserable for your liking but your still eager for a drink, the Hotel has its own bar on the lowest floor near reception! The cocktails are creative and they have a great selection of spirits and liquor. The staff were wonderful and made the 'night in' a highlight experience for us! Bartenders Tony and Jose are craftsmen behind the bar and Lilly offered excellent table service the whole team exuded energy and were happy to offer up their wisdom of Manhattan to the tourists.\nA top notch hotel where the weather won't hold you back from experiencing a Manhattan Martini!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:05:35.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
