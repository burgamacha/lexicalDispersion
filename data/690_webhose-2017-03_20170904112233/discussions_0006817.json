The breakfast was croissants , toast, jam,butter and muffins and cheese and hot drinks and orange juice which was grand by us. The location is good, the only thing I would say is that check in is at 3 would be nice if it was earlier as we had an early flight and wanted to settle in our room but had to walk around until check in time. I am staying here again in July with my boyfriend as everything else was good .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:24:57.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
