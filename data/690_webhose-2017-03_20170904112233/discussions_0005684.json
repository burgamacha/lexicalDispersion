The hotel is quite basic but based on location and price, this hotels gets 4 star.\nPositives - the staff were very helpful and friendly, free buffet breakfast including hot dishes offered plenty of choice. Free hot drinks available throughout the day was a nice added extra. Room facilities were good including a safe and a full size fridge in the room was an added bonus and it wasn't too noisy either.\nNegatives - the shower was a little pathetic. Room walls are a bit thin so noisy neighbours could be a potential problem. The breakfast area is small, so you may have to wait if you don't want to use the breakfast bar area but want a table.\nGiven that it's NYC, room size was better than expected and the bathroom was a reasonable size too. Furniture/decor may be a bit faded/worn but given the fact that you are within minutes of Times Square but away from the hustle and bustle, this is a great choice if you want location, but don't want to pay the earth.\nRoom Tip: Book a room away from the elevator, which can be noisy.
