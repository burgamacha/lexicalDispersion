Perfect location in central London, the friendliest staff EVER, and hi-tech refurbished rooms. They just have it all. The full package.\nI stayed there with my wife, dad and friend for three nights (early March 2017), as I was in London to attend my graduation ceremony. The staff literally killed themselves to be helpful, even preparing me a surprise treat in the room to congratulate me on the occasion. The concierge, who receives you with a glass of champagne upon arrival, was incredibly helpful in tips and research on touristic and commercial places of interest. The front office team, every single one of them, were superbly nice. It doesn't get any better in terms of staff friendliness.\nIf I were to find a single downside - which is not an easy task - it would be that the rooms were pretty small. But alas, this is the case in the whole of central London when you're paying the same price range!\nAbsolutely satisfying, and I will seriously find it meaningless to search for another hotel in any forthcoming trip to London.\nBravo team Piccadilly London West End!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:42:08.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
