Location is great and very good local restaurants nearby. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel itself very clean and very quiet for a good nights sleep after a day of hard walking. I can also say that we used the airport shuttle service and had no problems with being picked up and taken to the airport by a very friendly taxi driver....would highly recommend to anyone for a few days in Grande Paris", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:43:48.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
