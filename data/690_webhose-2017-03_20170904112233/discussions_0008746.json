We were all very happy with our stay here. The staff are the best thing; friendly, helpful and courteous, they couldn't do enough for us (I hope that the management look after them). Cleanliness is 5 star. We booked 3 twin rooms. I stayed in room (number 62) at the back of the hotel. Very quiet and overlooked a row of mews houses. Didn't hear any traffic noise from the Cromwell Road. Breakfast buffet was excellent & had a wide range of hot & cold breakfast items to suit all nationalities & preferences. Ideally located for visiting central London, it is just a 10 minute walk to Gloucester Road tube station. A big thank you to all of the staff who made our stay so enjoyable (from the 6 girls travelling from France) . I will definately stay here again on my next trip to London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:12:48.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
