The location is great, a lot of bars, restaurants and sites nearby. The decor is beautiful. Each room has its own style. (The hotel was kind enough to upgrade us for our last night so we got to sample two of them during our stay.) The hotel bar is a gem, very chic and intimate with a fantastic cocktail list. Finally, the staff was exceptional --in particular the two bartenders that were working when we created a perfect environment. In short, I cannot say enough about the hotel and we will definitely stay there again. I highly recommend. (One small note, I am not sure if it is the best hotel for guests with children, the environment was definitely refined and more suitable for adults.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:58:59.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
