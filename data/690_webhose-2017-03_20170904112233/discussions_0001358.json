Taxi from JFK to hotel is about US$60 and if you are on a budget you can take the NYC Airporter (shutter bus $18 per way) located few streets from this hotel. Grand Central station is a block away..\nRight across the hotel, you can find deli, Asian food and many other choices around within short distance.\nRoom is clean, lift is spacious and 24 hours access to the club living room that offers free coffee, tea, fruits & snacks. They even provide bottles by the coolers where you can fill water. Really neat idea!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:09:19.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
