There is plenty of shopping availableâ€¦.either at the end of the block (Galleries Lafayette, etc.) or a longer walk away in the more elegant Madeline stores.\nThe Metro (7) is also just down the block and will take you to the Louvre in only three stops.\nThere is a pharmacy across the street and plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood which extends down into the Opera area to the southeast.\nThe hotel itself has the feeling of an older property that has been renovated. Our room was quite compact and the closet was one of the smallest I have ever seen again indicating that they were working with the constraints of the space available.\nOur bed was supposed to be a king but actually was two beds pushed next to each other. That said, they were quite comfortable after a day of walking through the city. The bathroom was modern but only had a shower.\nIf I stay here again I would check to see if they have other larger rooms available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:42:26.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
