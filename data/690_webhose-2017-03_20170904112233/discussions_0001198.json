It's tucked slightly away from the bustle of Boulevard Saint Germain so that you are close to so many places while still maintaining the private luxury of a boutique hotel. A short walk to numerous museums, shops and restaurants. We had a junior sweet which offered plenty of space-especially the dressing area. Our large windows opened to a view of the Eiffel Tower and Grand Palais. Breakfast was delivered each morning at the exact time we requested. I can't say enough about the attentive staff that was always willing to help us with any request.\nWe look forward to our next trip to Paris and Hotel Montalembert.\nRoom Tip: room 71 had beautiful views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:54:14.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
