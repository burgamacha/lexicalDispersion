The hotel is very well located, right next to Hyde Park Corner and a 3 minute walk from Paddington Station\n2. We were looked after really well by the entire staff of the hotel. A special mention for Mathilda who went beyond the call of duty and even found out theatre timings for us.\n3. The room was outstanding and very clean.\n4. The hotel has excellent parking facilities right outside the hotel.\nWe will definitely come again and again to this lovely hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:46:57.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
