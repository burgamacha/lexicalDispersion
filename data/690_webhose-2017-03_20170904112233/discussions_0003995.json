I could've stayed much longer, but we needed to move on to travel! One of the best parts of the room was when we landed at 8 am, the room was ready for you and we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite. Our room had a kitchen, living room, two bedrooms and two baths! Everything was A+ all the way! The court yard was adorable! I cannot say enough good things about the Taj 51!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:57:34.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
