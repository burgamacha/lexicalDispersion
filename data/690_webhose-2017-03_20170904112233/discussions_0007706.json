I was taking my daughter for a surprise for her 21st birthday and as she is studying for a HND in musical theatre I knew she would like to stay in the Times Square area. We have visited NY before and we are aware that the rooms are on the small side, but after all we only want somewhere sleep at the end of the night as we are out from early to late busy taking in all the sites. I had put in a request for a certain room after reading reviews and was allocated the room requested. I had also mentioned that it was my daughters 21st and to our surprise the hotel delivered a bottle of wine and a piece of birthday cake, what a lovely jester by them. The room although small was spotless, lovely snowy white fluffy towels, slept very well in the bed. We both really enjoyed are stay here and would recommend it to anyone.\nRoom Tip: 1829 nice view of the sky line See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:04:52.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
