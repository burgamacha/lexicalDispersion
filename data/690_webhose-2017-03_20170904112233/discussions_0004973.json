They were aware that I was staying on business and given the length of my stay placed me on a high floor with a surprisingly beautiful view. While nowhere in NYC is sound proof I was able to sleep through the nights and this is what I need above all else. I would have rebooked this hotel for my next stay but the price increase was too steep.\nI arrived at the hotel a few hours earlier than the standard check in but they'd already had my room assigned and ready. The amenities in the room were pretty standard and their engineering team was able to help me hook up my media player to the TV. The only complaint about the room itself is the lack of a real minifridge. The one in the room has to be turned on every 2 hours making it quite useless for someone trying to store food while they're working. The hotel did not have regular minifridge for request to accommodate long term guests.\nThe onsite cafe was good but a bit pricey. I went once and ordered a mcmuffin type thing and a tea which came to $16.00... Yikes! The cafe itself is very relaxing, thoughtfully laid out, and has a nice view. The gym was likely the best gym I've ever seen in a hotel. Plenty of space, and enough equipment and free weights that you can hit just about every exercise in your routine. A really awesome touch is the complimentary headphones at the gym in case you forget or break your own.\nThe hotel is right next to a subway station making getting around very easy. There's a Duane Reade right at the corner too. There's lots of restaurants, cafe's, bars, etc within walking distance though everything seemed to close a little too early. Would recommend and stay again.\nRoom Tip: Get a high floor.
