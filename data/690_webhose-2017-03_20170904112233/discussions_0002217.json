Since the street it's on is off the main avenue a block or so, we found it quiet and central for places we wanted to visit.\nThe rooms are typical of European small hotels, nothing fancy but very functional. In fact, we were pleased with the staff upon checking in and the ample breakfast bar. The breakfast room was in the basement which I was concerned about after looking at the pictures. However, it turned out to be delightful in fact charming.\nIn the end, a very memorable experience that I would repeat if we return to Paris in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:45:16.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
