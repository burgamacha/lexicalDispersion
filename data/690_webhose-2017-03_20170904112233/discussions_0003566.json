The decor is what caught my eye, very eclectic and industrial 20's, steampunk feel. So glad we chose this place! Perfect location, adorable place, and THE best breakfast! The rooms are very small ( it's Europe!), and the bed very firm ( but doable, with nice pillows). The staff were great too- we accidentally left our do not feature sign up so our room was not made up, and as soon as we asked for fresh towels, the manager himself came and cleaned our room for us. Impressive! We will definitely stay here again, felt intimate and safe, so happy with the experience!!\nRoom Tip: Ask for an upgrade, had room 312, has a patio with lounge chairs!
