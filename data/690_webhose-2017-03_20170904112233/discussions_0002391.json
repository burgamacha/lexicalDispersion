Our bedroom was drum themed (drums being our bedroom tables which we loved). Bedroom was on the small side but that's common in Paris. Bathroom was a good size. Our room was quiet. Funky hotel. Staff were very helpful. Many of the main tourist areas are within walking distance as are some cafes and restaurants. Place de Vendome is 5mins away.\nWe would have liked to have had a kettle in our room so we could make tea after a long days sightseeing, though the receptionist gladly made us a pot of hot water from their own machine.\nRoom Tip: Room on a high floor as ever, though the streets around are quiet.
