The service was excellent. We got up grated room with french balcony, thanks with our long lasted Club membership in SLH. The room was street size on 4th floor and you could see the Steps from your balcony. There was good breakfast which was served on the top of the hotel out or in as you wished. The only negative thing what I have to say was that there are lot of steps when the lift is not working from the ground floor up to 4th floor. It goes from 1st to 3rd.\nRoom Tip: The room with french balcony on street side on 4th floor was good. The cheaper rooms havenÂ´t this.
