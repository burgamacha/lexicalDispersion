Homewood was much more reasonable PLUS the room and service exceeded our expectations. Erich checked us in. He was very friendly and welcoming. Our room was clean and quite large, including a full kitchen- which we didn't need, but good to know for further reference. They offer complimentary wine or beer in the evening from 5-7 M-Th plus a light dinner. The dinner was very good! This particular evening they offered cream of broccoli soup, Caesar salad and fajitas plus bread sticks, chips, salsa etc. it was a full meal. Javier was our host and kept our wine glasses full.\nBreakfast is also included, however we needed to leave early to catch a flight. If it's anything like the 'social hour' I'm sure it's very good too.\nEveryone was very friendly. We will stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:52:33.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
