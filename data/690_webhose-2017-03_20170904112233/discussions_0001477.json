We couldn't have chosen a better hotel, from the moment we arrived at this beautiful boutique hotel we were treated like royalty. We stayed in a duplex suite which was spacious and luxurious, and with a view onto the stunning courtyard. We were sent champagne by the manager on our first day and throughout our stay all the staff could not do enough for us. The breakfast was delicious with a good selection of delights to set you up for a day of walking around Paris. On the day of our ceremony, the hotel set aside an area for us, even helping our photographer move the furniture, to allow us some privacy and a stunning setting to renew our wedding vows. We also received a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the day and generally we were made to feel so special. In addition to the stunning decor which is a mix of modern and traditional, we can't praise the staff highly enough, they really did make our trip special. We will definitely be returning to this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel of high class and quality with an intimate and homely feeling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:56:50.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
