Honestly, we had a little trouble getting the hotel due to \"crazy levels of traffic\" which certainly was not the hotles fault but worth mentioning as driving in NYC is a wild adventure. Once we pulled in and checked in, we experienced nothing but friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is close to subway stations and restaurants.\nThe breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious. The staff was helpful and keep the food flowing out. We especially liked the \"make your own\" waffles. The coffee was also very good (Seattle's Best\" which was nice on cold mornings.\nThe rooms were a nice size but typically NYC small. The elavators were quick which we also liked. The bathrooms were clean and plenty of shampoo, towles, etc.\nWe have stayed in NYC hotles many times on Manhattan and the next time we plan a NYC visit, we will definately come back here as you cannot beat the price and service. Also the Bellman was super helpful, friendly and infoirmative.\nCheck out was super easy and the valet was also quick with the car service. We loved our 3 days here.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors is quieter with nice view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:37:01.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
