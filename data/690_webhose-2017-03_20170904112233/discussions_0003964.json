The Residence Inn is fabulous. We were upgraded to a Park View Room on the 61st floor and the views were spectacular. The room is equipped with a full kitchen, club chairs and table, huge bathroom (shower only which suited us) and a king sized bed. Compared to other hotels we stayed in, in NYC at a similar price, The Residence Inn is streets ahead. Our friends in The W were disappointed and thought we had a much nicer room. Very pleasant front desk and Accommodation staff. Breakfast is complimentary but only served from 06.30 to 09.30 and the staff are very strict about shutting it down. The actual breakfast room is very pleasant and although breakfast is basic and doesn't change from day to day it is sufficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:59.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
