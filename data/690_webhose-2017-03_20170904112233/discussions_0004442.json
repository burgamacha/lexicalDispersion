The staff were great and upgraded the birthday boys room for us. It had a boutique feel to it. The rooms were lovely and bright, with a nice bathroom and great shower. Although the rooms were not big they were fine for a weekend stay and had everything you needed including a fridge with complementary soft drinks. Comfy bed with good pillows.We did not have breakfast, but it was really busy so I would guess it was ok.the location was good for us, walkable to wherever we wanted to go. The metro was 5 mins away if you wanted it though. Reasonably priced for Paris. Definitely recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:57:16.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
