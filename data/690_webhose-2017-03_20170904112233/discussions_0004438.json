I chose it because it was close to Gare du Nord, where we arrived. What an excellent choice. Reception was welcoming and knowledgeable. They even let us into our room early and held our luggage on the last day. Our room was very modern with a great shower and safe. WiFi was free and good.We had a view of the street but it was still quiet. The breakfast buffet was extensive and tasty. There are pleasant sitting areas inside and out. We were told today that the owner is an architect and art lover which explains the great quality. It was also well priced", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:23:07.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
