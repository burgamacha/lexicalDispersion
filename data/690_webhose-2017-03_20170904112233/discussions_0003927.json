My friend booked the hotel and I was a little sceptical at first with the shared bathrooms, but it wasn't a problem at all. You have lights in your room which light up to inform you which bathrooms are being used. The staff were so friendly, and the hotel is about a 20 minute walk away from all the tourist spots (Times Square, Central Park, Top of the Rock). There is a cute little cafe up the block called Treehaus which we visited most days for breakfast. They do a lovely breakfast buffet which you can eat in or take out. I would highly recommend this hotel. I am visiting New York again this year and I wanted to book up again at Pod 51, but they had no rooms available at the time I am visiting so I was pretty gutted about that. 10/10!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:03:14.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
