This is not only a hotel, this is an institution.\nThe service is on the highest level I ever saw.\nThe Consierge desk, Mr. Alexandre, Mrs. Krista Sorrentino, Mr. Mootz, Mr. Robert D Geist, Mr. McKinley.... if I have forgotten someone, please be don't mad with me. But these guys know everything. They arrange everything, in a such so professional way, that words can't explain.\nThe complete stuff is so professional and polite, I never saw that. From doormen to luggage porter, from front desk to butler service over house keeping. They see details I never saw.\nThe hotel is more then clean, the rooms are big.\nThe restaurant and the bar is amazing.\nWhen in nyc then st Regis. It's not only a hotel, it's a place where you feel at home.\nThank you guys.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:56:57.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
