I travel a lot for work and belong to the Marriott Rewards program so I booked two nights at the Residence Inn on Broadway with my points. Upon check in I asked the gal behind the desk to hook us up with a view, bot did she! We were put in a corner room on the 61st floor. One direction I could see the Hudson River and the other was Times Square and the city view. It was awesome both day and night.\nI can't say enough about this property, the breakfast was great and included with the room. If you have ever ate out in NYC you appreciate that. The staff was all terrific and very helpful. The best part though, the location. Walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, 5th avenue, we even visited the Trump Tower while there. I would stay again and highly recommend this property.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have best views and help with the city noise.
