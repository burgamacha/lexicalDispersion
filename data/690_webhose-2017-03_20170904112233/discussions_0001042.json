The hotel was lovely and met our expectations. The location of this hotel was great with the green park underground around the corner, Hyde Park, and a great restaurant area nearby (Shepherd Market). The best part of our stay was definitely two individuals though. Ian at the bar went out of his way to accommodate us and specifically my son who has a peanut and tree nut allergy. The other individual is Joshua, the concierge. Joshua is a sweet, kind man. He made us feel special during our stay and we looked forward to seeing him each morning. We had a few unique tourist ideas, such as hiking from Seaford to Eastbourne, and Joshua went out of his way to investigate the logistics for these adventure. I will definitely return to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:03:07.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
