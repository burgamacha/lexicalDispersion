The location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria station was pretty much as good as it gets. The lack of a restaurant didn't bother me and the pre-ordered breakfast to the room was fine and not overly priced.\nThe staff was the friendliest and most smiling I think I've ever seen in a hotel, and not in a fake-sort-of-way. They truly were welcoming.\nThe only \"negative\" that I can remember is that the bed was a tad too short for my tall nordic torso.\nIf the price remains as affordible compared to other hotels, I would have not problem recommending this hotel to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:08:00.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
