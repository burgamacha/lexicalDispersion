We most definitely got bang for our buck. Average sized hotel on a (not particularly silent) but quiet street off of a square. We had the Twin Club Room for two people. We each got our own twin bed. Beds were decent, although the pillows could have been a bit better, but I'm being picky here. The bathroom was clean and just what you needed. *bring your own shampoo, etc*, they did offer a bar of soap, cups, and shower gel.\nMy friend took a shower and didn't realize the plug in the tub was all the way down, we waited overnight to see if it would drain, it did not. So we called the front desk and the maid came and fixed that for us, she was so so nice! She also brought extra towels as we requested and took the dirty ones as well. Super great service.\nWe rented a safe for 2 euros a day, since there isn't one in the room. Worth it. The safes are like a mailbox system, best way to describe it, you get a key and you can access it at any time! There are multiple individual safes.\nYou leave your room key at the front desk every time you leave the hotel. And when you arrive outside the hotel you must push the doorbell so that the front desk can let you in, a great safety feature.\nBreakfast was great in the morning! An array of hot & cold drinks, croissants and pastries, fruits, cheeses and meats, yogurt, etc. No hot foods though.\nAll in all an amazing time, and being at this hotel helped our Paris experience! It was nice to know we'd return to a comfortable, clean, and safe hotel at the end of the day.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a street view, and rent a safe for 2 euros a day See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:27:25.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
