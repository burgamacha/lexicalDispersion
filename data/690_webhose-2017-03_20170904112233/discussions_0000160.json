This hotel is in a great position for exploring Paris - short walk from Gare du Nord if you come by Eurostar. The staff were warm and welcoming and let us check in early. The Breakfast buffet is lovely offering a huge variety of fresh fruit, salad and breads. There is a little cinema and gym in the cellar which is quite quirky although we didn't use them. I can recommend the cocktails in the evening - quite pricey but very tasty! Would definitely recommend this hotel for a Paris visit. (This is actually the 2nd Astotel hotel I've stayed in in Paris and they are a lovely chain that has individual hotels that don't feel like a chain at all.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:40:41.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
