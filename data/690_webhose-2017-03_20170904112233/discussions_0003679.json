This hotel is in a great location, just over the East River with easy access to multiple subway lines. Three stops to Central Park! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, answering all our questions with a smile. Housekeeping was very good, keeping the rooms in great shape all week, even when we were challenging! Breakfast is very busy between 8-9, but they keep up well and replenish things promptly. We did valet parking for our car, and didn't worry about it at all - great help! For all this, you might expect to pay a lot, but the rooms were a HUGE value at under $100/night. Five stars and great work to everyone here. We'll definitely be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:37:29.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
