We decided that on some future trip we'd stay at The Library Hotel and finally did it while celebrating our 27th anniversary. It took us over ten years to stay there but it was worth the wait. We'll be back. The room was excellent, especially the bathroom. Each room is themed and we had \"Travel Book,\" next to the \"Asian History\" room. Our room had shelved covered with travel books. The bed was extra comfortable and the tv set was of good size.\nThe 24 hour lounge with snacks and coffee, the evening wine and cheese hours, the morning continental breakfast were all great.\nAbove all, the staff at The Library Hotel went out of their way to be helpful. They knew us by name almost immediately and volunteered help at every opportunity. It's a great crew!\nRoom Tip: If you love books, see if you can get a room with a theme of interest to you.
