The problem with TV in the room was extremely quickly handled by an engineer on duty.\nOn a positive note - the front desk staff was extremely professional and welcoming. They personified my stay and I am very grateful for that.\nThe location is great - a subway station is just a block away, and Herald square with multiple subway lines is three blocks away. Near Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, iconic Macy's, walking distance to Times Square and Rockfeller centre. Plenty of options for breakfast/lunch/dinner as the hotel bar was disappointing. GiGi cafe around the corner is superb.\nI stayed in three HGI in Manhattan, and this one is the best!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:54:21.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
