No odors, or environmental issues. The staff is helpful and friendly. We stayed here last year in March also. That room had a noisy radiator (8th floor), but this year we were on the 9th floor, which looks to have been more recently updated. The one weird thing was that every day we should have had 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, 2 washcloths and 1 bath mat. We got random amounts of each, every day, one day no washcloths but 3 bath towels, etc. The last day we had extra towels and washcloths and no bath mat. It's a budget hotel by New York standards, at least in the off-season (before April & summer). Very close to subway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:37:29.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
