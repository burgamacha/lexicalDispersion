Quick and easy check-in, very friendly staff, clean and spacious room ( exactly what we needed with a toddler who has far too much energy!) with good air conditioning. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice - extra points for fresh orange juice and high chairs available. Again, staff made us feel very welcomed and every morning greeted my son by his name which is always a nice touch. We would definitely stay in IQ again.\nRoom Tip: We've stayed in room 114, which was absolutely perfect for family 2+1 See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:20:26.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
