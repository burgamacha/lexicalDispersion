Nothing is to much for the staff who always went out of their to help in any way they could. The location of the hotel is excellent 10 mins walk to Time Square and Empire state building.\nThe breakfast which is included is very good and really does set you up for the day. The girls loved the waffle machine!\nWe were given a room up grade when we complained that our room was quite small and what an up grade it was the room was massive the biggest we have stayed in, it even had a corner sofa which was very welcoming after a days sight seeing.\nThe sunset from the roof terrace is really special to watch.\nWe would defiantly return to this lovely hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:53:03.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
