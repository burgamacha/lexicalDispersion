You could hear the street noise in the room but not enough to be a pain.\nThe hotel is nicely done (but rooms could do with a bit of light maintenance i.e. curtain falling down). All the staff were attentive and friendly. Not sure it lives up to the honour of 'Forbes best properties in the world 2016' but we liked it and would definitely come back.\nWe liked the free tea and coffee available in the lobby in the afternoon and decent speed in-room free wifi that never gets disconnected.\nOne thing I'd change - breakfast was pretty poor - continental for $20 was a plate of pastries and either fruit or yoghurt - not sure many people eat there as there are better/cheaper options a short walk from hotel.\nArea feels nice and safe which was important to me being alone with my son.\nThanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:26:45.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
