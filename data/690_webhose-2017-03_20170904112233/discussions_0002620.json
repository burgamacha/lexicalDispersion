She was greeted and treated as well as my family were treated. The room was elegant and comfortable. The pull-out bed was scrumptious and NO BAR ACROSS MY SON's BACK! I must say, we have never experienced service and kindness like we were shown at this hotel. We aren't wealthy, just a good 'ol Southern family and not a political supporter of Mr. Trump. We extended our stay because of this hotel. One a day that I was not able to get out and walk my service dog, the hotel provided a dog walker and took all stress off of me in the process. My son was just old enough to handle some family things like tipping, dinner reservations... The hotel staff were marvelous with him! Actually, he has been a different person since our stay - Much more self-assured, confident, and knowledgeable about handling himself in an upscale, busy atmosphere. We did not have this experience at other hotels (not Trump hotels)of this category during our trip! As a matter-of-fact, when we checked-in, I had hit my expense limit on my credit card without realizing it. It was quite late, I was a bit worried and embarrassed when the front desk called to tell me the charge had been denied. Where we're from, folks get shown the door at hotels when this happens! Not at Trump International NYC. You hear about Southern kindness...? Well, it's nothing compared to how they treat their customers at this hotel! Of course , the $ issue was resolved the next morning! The food was excellent!!! Concierge service impeccable! I would recommend this hotel to anyone from anywhere and in any condition - disabled, relaxed, active, private , or outgoing, family, couple, or individual, savvy, city, or country mouse! :-) You will not regret staying at this place! I sure hope that we can return someday!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:41:06.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
