We were greeted by a very kind doorman who jumped into action when he saw I had a sleeping child in my arms, before I even had the chance to grab luggage he grabbed it for me. The room was very well appointed, and the room service was delicious. Try the afternoon tea it is a must experience after a long morning of walking around. They are very family friendly, even given my youngest a backpack filled with goodies. They even arranged a vey reasonably priced private car to take us Cambridge and the countryside. This was one of the absolute best hotel experiences I have ever had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:31:16.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
