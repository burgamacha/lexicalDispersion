Luxurious it is not but we've stayed here several times and like it each time. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, the rooms are either cozy (i.e., small) or comfortable (i.e., bigger) but all are clean and well equipped. The free continental breakfast works well for us but if you want a full breakfast the restaurant is attached and very good. In fact, the restaurant is a local gem and we often have dinner there especially on travel days which says a lot given the choices. Very friendly staff and rates are very competitive.\nRoom Tip: Rooms on the west side seem bigger but ask the front desk See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:56:34.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
