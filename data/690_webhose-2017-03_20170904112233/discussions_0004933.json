The service is world class and the concierge was absolutely amazing and so helpful! We traveled from Nashville, TN to NYC to celebrate our anniversary. They made planning a last minute trip a breeze and I was so thankful. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was spotless (with turn down service). The room is just huge by NYC standards. Location is fabulous, near St. Patrick's and within 1/2 mile'ish from Times Square. Walking everywhere or Uber was simple. I just can't say enough about our amazing experience!\nRoom Tip: The Towers are small floors, you can't make a bad choice!
