Located at the heart of Time Square sitting in it you would have no idea. A perfect example of a calm, relaxed and friendly family hotel. The staff, without exception, were pleasant, attentive and exceptionally helpful. We were in New York for our son's 15th birthday and the hotel helped to make it a really memorable one for him, even if he did get a bit embarrassed. I cannot thank the hotel enough for their friendship and support that made our New York break without doubt our best ever city break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:10:15.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
