The room was lovely, clean, with a nice view of the Thames and the planes arriving at the airport. The hotel itself was lovely, but best of all was the service from the staff. They were all so helpful and willing to help whenever they could. The breakfast staff were great, making sure we had everything we needed, including a high chair for our smallest child.\nBut it was the reception staff that really made the difference. We had to leave the hotel early on our last morning due to me taking part in the North London Half Marathon, and although breakfast didn't start until 6.30am, Katerina made sure that we had breakfast delivered to our room for 6am.\nThe staff at the hotel really made our trip, and we will definatley be using the hotel again anytime we come back to London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:14:53.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
