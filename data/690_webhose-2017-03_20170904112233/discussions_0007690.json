I was a visitor shortly after it opened and I am pleased to see that the hotel stays well maintained throughout years now. It is true that rooms are rather smallish, so if you like to stay in your room and enjoy the space, this is not the place. None the less, the rooms are clean and fresh. Although small, the bathroom is pretty and modern with a walk in shower and LÂ´occitane toiletries (pleasant touch). I do tend to ask for a room away from the main road if they have availability, as the road side can be quite noisy. I tried their breakfast buffet too and enjoyed it. Although the selection can be limited compared to 5 star hotels, you still find pretty much everything one would need for a decent breakfast. The restaurant area at the time I was there was not overcrowded so it was nice to relax there and enjoy the service.\nThe reception staff is always friendly and welcoming. The housekeeping does a good job too. I hope they keep up the standards as it is a nice place for a short stay in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:15:51.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
