When we arrived we were greeted by Lotte who was very welcoming & friendly & gave us all the information we required for our stay. She also told us that we had been upgraded to a King Junior Suite.\nThe Suite was terrific with lots of room, lamps, a very comfy sofa & plenty of power points. As a female I especially liked the power point at the bottom of a long mirror which was excellent for using the hair dryer. This was a real bonus!! The bed & the pillows were s amazingly comfortable. Slept very well & wasn't aware of noisy traffic even though we were at the front of the hotel on the main road. Overall the accommodation was excellent.\nWe had a couple of glasses of Champagne in the bar before going out & again all the staff were very friendly & helpful. Breakfast was very good, hot delicious food, nothing too much trouble for the staff.\nOn checking out Chiara was again very friendly, making sure that we had an enjoyable stay & that there were no problems.\nWe had a fantastic stay at the Charing Cross Hotel & would have no hesitation in recommending it to friends. It is in a terrific location, central for lots of amenities & Museums, Galleries etc.\nJust loved it.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel & the traffic noise was no problem.
