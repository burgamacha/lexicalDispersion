We had gotten tickets to see Hamilton as their birthday present, and I thought it would be fun to stay overnight in the city the night before. I chose this hotel because it was so close to the theater, not thinking about the fact that it was also a block away from Times Square on NYE weekend. To say it was a little chaotic in the neighborhood, even the night BEFORE NYE, would be quite the understatement. We could barely fight our way to the hotel through the crowds in Times Square. But despite the noise and crowds just down the street, our hotel room was very quiet, the hotel lobby was calm, the hotel staff were helpful. If you are going to the theater, the hotel is very convenient, although I think for out-of-towners (I lived in NYC for 25 years, so even though I live out of town now, I don't really think of myself as an out-of-towner) Times Square is not the best place to be if you really want to get a sense of non-touristy New York. But I'm sure the hotel staff would be helpful in directing you to activities anywhere in the city. They seemed very professional.\nCheck-in was quick and easy. Our room was nice, attractive, and comfortable. And quiet. The beds were comfortable with luxurious linens. The toiletries and amenities were high quality. A very nice big shower, no tub. All the usual amenities.\nI had breakfast in the hotel restaurant in the morning. The food was excellent, the service was great, the restaurant was nice, but it was quite expensive. With so many places to eat in the city, I would not normally eat in the hotel for breakfast, but we didn't feel like dealing with the chaos outside.\nAll in all, it was a nice New York city hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:21:47.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
