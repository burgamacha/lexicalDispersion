The staff was great - they were kind and sincerely helpful. I needed baby food at 6AM - and the front desk clerk was very helpful with instructions on how to find the local 24 hour deli. The deli was only around the corner - and they were also great! They provide complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the morning The hot chocolate was the best!\nThe rooms were clean - I always inspect everything and the mattress was old - but I could not find anything wrong with it. The bathroom was very clean.\nWe did not have any problem sleeping and we had a beautiful view of the neighborhood from our 6th floor room.\nWe did not use any of the fitness area - our grandson was too young :) But it looked clean with a variety of work out equipment.\nParking down and across the street was great. The attendants at the parking garage\nwere very respectful and helpful. Joseph and Mario at the garage were so wonderful I did not worry about our vehicle at all.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 6th floor - we had a nice view of the city.
