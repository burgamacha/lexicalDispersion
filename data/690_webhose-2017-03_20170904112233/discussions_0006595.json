Location is perfect a very short walk to the subway, easy access to all subway lines.( buy an unlimited 7 day pass to make the most of your stay)( lines F & M take you to the nearest stop other trains are express and don't stop at 14 th street station). The room was beautiful and very clean as you'd expect. The staff are very friendly and so helpful ( a porter named Angel, so nice and couldn't be more helpful). All the staff we encountered were polite , friendly and always smiling. We would highly recommend this hotel! We stayed on the 16 th floor and the view of the city was worth it!!\nRoom Tip: Stay above the 16 th floor for best views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:48:59.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
