Upon arrival the staff was extremely kind and accommodating. Taking my things and reminding me it was time to relax. Allan made check in very smooth and quick. The room was extremely clean and comfortable with a great view of the city. The bathroom was one of my favorite parts. Compared to other NYC hotels you could actually move and had space. Everytime I returned back to the hotel I was greeted by a warm hello and smile, which goes a long way. I highly recommend staying at this hotel when traveling to the city!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:06:22.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
