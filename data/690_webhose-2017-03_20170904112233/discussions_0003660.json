The hotel is located right in the center near the Jewish synagogue (hence extremely secured) and near Galeries Lafayette so it's perfect for shopping. The entertainment area is just a couple of km away (about 20 minutes walk) or two stations on the subway.\nHotel wise - the room I got was pretty small but the room my parents got was very spacious. Breakfast was minimal and there was a queue to the only coffee machine around. The guys at reception are super nice, helpful and professional. The bed was very comfortable and the lightning was just right. Despite the fact the hotel is located in the center it is hidden behind the main road in a side street hence the room was quiet during nighttime.\nIf you're not looking for something posh this hotel is just great, perfect for budget tourists and for sightseeing purposes.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:37:57.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
