It is located 20 steps from the Rue de Rivoli, all shopping is in walking distance, centre Pompidou, le Marais, Louvre, Hotel de Ville, St Michel, Notre Dame, you name it is in walking distance.\nThe hotel staff is extremely friendly, the hotel is quite small and intimate. It feels like you are invited at someone's house. In the evening they would ask you if you want to take your breakfast there and will prepare it for you. All the staff was amazing and so warm.\nThe rooms are small but nice. Good beds. Very quite although in the heart of Paris.\nReally a great small hotel in the center of Paris. Excellent for a couple. We will go back next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:03:06.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
