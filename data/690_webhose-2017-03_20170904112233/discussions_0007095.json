If we booked a room by the end of March, we could get a room that usually goes for approximately $450 for under $200. Who could say no to that? We loved our visits in 2014 and 2015, and were definitely up for another.\nWe arrived at the Soho Grand in just over an hour and a half, door to door. The doorman greeted us with a great big smile and a welcoming hello. When we checked in, we asked if it was possible for an upgrade (as we always do), and were given a corner room on the 14th floor!\nOne window looked out toward the Hudson River. And the other window looked toward the Empire State Building! You can see it off to the left in the distance. The view from our room was even more beautiful at night.\nThe Salon at the Soho Grand was the perfect spot to enjoy afternoon tea and a glass of bubbly.\nIn the morning, we decided to have coffee in the “Living Room” before we checked out. It’s such a warm and inviting space. It was hard to leave.\nJust off the main room, is the Club Room. A beautiful space for hotel guests only, where they offer cocktails and serve dinner.\nThe Soho Grand is by far our favorite place to stay in NYC. We look forward to going back again soon!\nRoom Tip: We always ask for an upgrade, if possible.
