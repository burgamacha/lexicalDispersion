Our room faced out onto the front and although traffic could be heard it did not really disturb us. Room was very clean and a decent size with a safe. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The free to use computers and printer in reception made printing tickets off etc very easy. Breakfast was good although busy at the weekend. Get there early. Wasn't a problem mid week. Plastic cutlery not so good !\nThe hotel location was spot on. Close to 34th street sub and only a few minutes walk to Times Square , Empire State Building and Macy's !!!\nIf you looking for luxury this is not for you.? If your looking for a good clean affordable hotel in the best location this is the one. Can't wait to go back !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:38:00.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
