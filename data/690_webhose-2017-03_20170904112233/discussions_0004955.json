After thorough comparison I decided to give Maison Albar a chance and I am really happy that I did! I came for a very special occassion, to surprise prorpose to my girlfriend, and I had emailed the hotel in advance to ask for anything special that they could do - i.e. room upgrade, super early check in. When I arrived at the hotel at 10:30am I was told that a room was not available but the person at the desk was extremely polite and helpful, took our bags and mentioned to come back after 1pm. When I came back we had an upgraded room and after proposing to my girlfriend that afternoon and coming back to our room we found a bottle of champagne and fruits waiting for us in the room, very classy by the hotel! We absolutely loved our quick 2 day trip to Paris and really enjoyed our stay at Maison Albar as we'll always remember it with a special memory. Definitely appreciate the kindness of the staff and we look forward to coming back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:38:55.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
