It is sited very conveniently half a mile from Borough (Northern line / Euston) and Southwark (Jubilee line / O2 Arena) tube stations, and 5 mins walk from a most excellent full English breakfast at Terrys Café, and about 20 mins from the Breakfast Club. A Tesco or Sainsburys are en route.\nThe rooms are small (if booking a double en suite ask for room 13, which is bigger than the others) and of differing shapes and sizes, but all are clean with welcoming décor and the en suites boast an invigorating power shower.\nTypical amenities, coffee tea and kettle, fridge, fruit and bottled water. Also free, 50+mbps! wifi.\nWhat sets the hotel apart are the proprietors, who could not do enough for you and will go far out of your way to ensure your stay is the best it can be. I left my towel behind and they spent an hour searching their laundry for it; it was eventually found and they are going to mail it to me.\nRoom Tip: Choose room 13, or a room on other than the ground floor.
