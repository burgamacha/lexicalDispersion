The hotel itself is lovely, clean, and charming. And the beds are s comfortable!\nI booked a Tuileries Room for 2 nights and was glad I chose to splurge on the room. Photos barely do the view justice - it's simply breathtaking in person and I adored having a small balcony on which to linger, sip champagne, and enjoy it all. The balconies are small and narrow, so likely won't accommodate sitting out there for a leisurely breakfast, but perfect for stepping out and enjoying the view.\nWith the hotel situated just next door to the ultra-posh Le Meurice and the famous Angelina cafe, it is truly a luxurious location at a not-overly-luxurious price - plus walking distance to practically everything I wanted to see!\nI gave them 5 stars but noticed a few minor details that could be improved. The shower, for instance, never held a steady temperature and had to be constantly adjusted. And my only disappointment was the room service breakfast - I didn't feel it was up to standard for a 4* hotel. A basket of breads, a plate of whole fruit that was rather bruised (2 apples, a small orange, and bunch of seeded grapes) and hot chocolate that was terribly watered down. For appx. $25, I hoped for better. That said, it was minor enough not to warrant a complaint or even dock a \"star\" but worth mentioning for future guests (these are bits I'd like to know if I were reading reviews).\nI greatly appreciated the staff - warm and friendly and several even wished me a happy birthday, making my day extra special. Overall, a truly marvelous experience and I greatly appreciate the hotel staff for making my birthday trip unforgettable!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:30:36.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
