The location itself is conveniently located to Central Park, but to reach everything else you need to either take the metro or take a taxi/uber (which can be a little pricey). However, it was definitely walkable distance to many other great places such as famous restaurants and whatnot. Or you can completely boycott public transportation and just walk if it is sunny outside. The hotel smells great right when you walk in (I believe you can buy their scent(s)), and the decor is very pinterest/instagram-esque; it is very modern but down-to-earth. The staff treated me very well the entire stay and made sure I had everything I needed. I ordered room service (for a meal, as it was raining outside and I refused to get wet!), and the food was delicious. I highly recommend it. The view I got was a view of the street, but still beautiful nonetheless. The bed was comfortable, shower was pretty cool. It is an expensive hotel, but it is worth the price due to location, staff, and food. This is NYC, after all. I would love to stay at their chain in Florida some day.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:11:43.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
