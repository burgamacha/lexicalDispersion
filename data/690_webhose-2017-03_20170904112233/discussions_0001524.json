We enjoyed the big TV also!\nThe staff were great and very friendly, one member of staff even tried to help me resolve an issue with my Wi-Fi on my laptop!\nThe only criticism I have is that the Wi-Fi in our room wasn't very reliable and kept cutting out at random times, forcing me to use 3G on my phone, but apart from that no major issues!\nThank you for having us, we'll be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:02:38.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
