The location is perfect, we didn't ride the subway once. There are a lot of restaurants and sights within a few blocks. If you like The Today Show, it's only two blocks away. My mom and I were able to get there super early and she even got picked for the Ambush Makeover!\nThe rooms themselves were basic. There was only one drawer at the bottom of the closet and the room was very rectangular (oddly laid out). The bathroom door is a sliding door so it doesn't completely close and you can hear everything through the door. With those small downsides, I would still stay here again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:31:59.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
