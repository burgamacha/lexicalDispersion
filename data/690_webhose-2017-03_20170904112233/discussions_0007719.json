What an experience, the atmosphere was amazing, the staff were attentive, it was quirky with Mrs Potts and Chip thrown into the mix. The savouries, especially the mini venison pie were amazing! Could have just ate a platter of those! Brioche was nice, sandwiches were great, I have seafood allergies which were catered for. Sweets - looked adorable but not my favorite part! Would not let it put you off going whilst it's available do it!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:58:08.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
