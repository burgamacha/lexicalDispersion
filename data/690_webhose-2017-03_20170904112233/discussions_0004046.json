However, we were pleasantly surprised with this Hotel. It has recently been refurbished and looks like a nice 3* hotel, nice clean and modern. The rooms are on the smallish side but to be honest you are only there to sleep. In the room, we were in on the 3rd Floor the bathroom was small, but again bearable for 3 days. The place was clean and the room was tidy and room maids take great care. We also had a breakfast option, this was a little bit of a let down as it was quite limited and there was no hot food apart from boiled eggs. This hotel is on the outskirts of the center but is next to a Metro station and a Tram line so connections are good. From the Hotel to Effiel Tower would take around 15-20mins by Metro. I would certainly go back and stay again though would have breakfast outside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:57:04.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
