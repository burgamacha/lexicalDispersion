I love the jazz theme of the hotel. It was a great place to stay while my cousin and I were enjoying March Madness at Madison Square Garden (go Gamecocks!).\nMy room was pretty much the expected NYC room -- very, very small bathroom; king bedroom without much space around the bed (but I swear my bed seemed smaller than a king). But the room was really clean and nicely appointed, with great lighting in room and bathroom.\nOther good stuff:\n* Alban and Anna at the bar -- fantastic, friendly, efficient, customer-service oriented\n* My housekeeper from Serbia -- why can't I remember her name? She was the housekeeper for the 22nd floor and was very sweet and helpful\n* Jorge from room service; he helped me a lot when I wasn't feeling well (Thank you, Jorge!)\n* The live jazz in the lobby area\n* Free water bottles\n* Location!\nThe \"needs work\" stuff:\n* Bar closes at midnight, even when it's full of happy guests on a Saturday night -- BOO. Hard to imagine that happens in NYC, of all places! My cousin and I were really enjoying chatting with other guests at the bar when it abruptly closed. Alban explained to us that he wasn't allowed to keep it open later than midnight. :(\n* Convenience store in hotel closed late at night so I couldn't get cold drinks when I needed them -- wish there was some way to have food/snacks/basic OTC meds available from store at all hours, like Courtyard and select Marriott properties\n* Seems like upgrade system could use refining. My cousin is lifetime platinum rewards and she got a slightly bigger room. I'm regular platinum rewards member and got no upgrade at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:26:41.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
