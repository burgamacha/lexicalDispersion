Their service could not have been better, right down to the breakfast chef, who kept four custom omelettes in the air at one time: better than a Broadway show! When one of us came down with stomach flu during our stay, the desk sent up complementary ginger ale. Very thoughtful! And their restaurant recommendations were on the money every time.\nPerfect location: on a subway stop, Empire State Building views, Macy's one block away, Madison Square Garden a short and safe walk. The facilities were fresh, clean, and fine--especially considering the fact that we paid under $200 per night--but it's the STAFF who make this hotel truly exceptional in every sense.\nWe will definitely consider the HIlton Garden Inn Midtown our home away from home in NYC!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a view of the Empire State Building!
