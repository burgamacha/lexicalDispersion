I would definitely return again. Despite not really loving the whole Times Square vibe, the hotel provides an oasis of calm in the busy city. The second floor lobby can be lively enough, but not frenetic. My room was quiet (as was the one in an earlier stay), well-appointed, and spacious. (Love the views and the window in the bathroom from my recent stay.) The personnel were unfailingly helpful and informative. The price was very competitive and the location excellent for trips around the Big Apple. Housekeeping was immaculate.
