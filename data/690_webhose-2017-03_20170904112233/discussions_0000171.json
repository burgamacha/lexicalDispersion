I hope to be back soon. The view was amazing. I loved standing out on the balcony watching Paris. Great place to watch the Eiffel tower twinkle at 11PM and midnight. The staff was extremely accommodating. Breakfast was wonderful. The downsides are as noted by others, there is a bit of street traffic noise at times, but after one night of street noise, I did not notice it any longer. We stayed 7 nights. The location is great and it is located between two metro stops. Also, the air conditioner was not very strong in March, but how fantastic is it that the weather was warm in March! We just loved our stay and will be back. A nice perk was the free drink or free drink coupon upon arrival. Also, free bottled water and free coffee was replaced in the room everyday. I hate being nickeled and dimed. Love free things. :)\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the Eiffel tower.
