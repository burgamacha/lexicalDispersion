Very popular bar and restaurant on the ground floor. The menu tended towards tex-mex food. The room was small but big enough for us. We had bunk beds to save on space with a bathroom behind frosted glass - you would need to be either related or very good friends to share this room! Telly on both bunk beds! Very comfortable beds and spotlessly clean. Roof top terrace gave great views over the city.\nNear Grand Central Station and about 15 mins walk from Times Square. Very helpful Concierge and easy check in. They offer their own shuttle to JFK Airport for $65.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:49:51.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
