So I looked at every hotel in town before booking the Rosewood. And I won't repeat what all the other reviews have said. This place is top of the heap and deserves its amazing reviews on trip advisor.\nBut a few tips: if you want to go see the art areas, splurge on the hotel's Jaguar, and have the friendly driver wait, and take you wherever else you want to go. The city is huge and it'll make the best use of your time. I also suggest having the hotel pick you top at the airport or train station. Decadent, I know! But that just extends the vibe and Beijing taxis are so-so.\nThe Country Kitchen restaurant is delicious. Ask for a seat facing the open kitchen. Plenty to watch. The breakfast buffet is killer, and though a bit pricey, great people watching and wake-up time.\nIf you want to take a bath, plan ahead, the tub is so huge it takes a while to fill up!\nHuge, serene, 24 hour gym.\nEverything about this property is deep quality. All things considered, it's a great value.\nRoom Tip: All rooms have expansive windows.
