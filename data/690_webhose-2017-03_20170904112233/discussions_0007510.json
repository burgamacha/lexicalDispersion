It couldn't be more convenient for the DLR at Royal Albert and there are some fairly local places to eat too. They do have a restaurant at the hotel but we'd already booked elsewhere.\nMust give Paula 5 stars for her enthusiastic and helpful table service when we came back to the bar after our meal. She really is an asset to the hotel, and we could see her helping out other customers ..particularly foreigners who were struggling with the menu or other matters. Although we didn't eat there, she made us feel very special.\nWe had the buffet breakfast before heading off to the airport. Very good and convenient.\nOverall a really good hotel for the money and we would definitely stay there again if we had an overnight stay in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:40:00.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
