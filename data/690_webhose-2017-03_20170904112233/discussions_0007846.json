The first room they put me in had a heating problem so they moved me the next day to a better room on a higher floor. Which made me very happy. One of my favorite restaurants is across the street! (Osteria Al Doge) and there are two broadway theatres on the block!\nMy only reservation is that not everyone who works here is polite and helpufl as they ought to be. I had some issues with rudeness on the phone, and then later, with one of the people at the front desk. I was prepared not to like The Premier Hotel. But I had a wonderful time here. This place is a real find.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:30:47.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
