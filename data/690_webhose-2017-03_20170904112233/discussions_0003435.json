It's close enough to the Theater District to be convenient, while being *just* out of the way enough to be more affordable. The rooms are chic and comfortable, and the ground floor features a cozy (and relatively inexpensive) bar/cafe. The walk to any of the major theaters is literally minutes, and it's only a slightly longer walk to Penn Station. In addition, the front desk staff, including Faye, clearly take guest appreciation and satisfaction very seriously. They've become my new go-to hotel in the area.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:28:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
