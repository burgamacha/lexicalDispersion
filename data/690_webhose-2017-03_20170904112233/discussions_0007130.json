I did the research through Trip Advisor and something keep pulling me towards staying here and boy was that one of the best things I have done in a long time. This hotel is anything and everything you could want in a hotel in Paris or anywhere. The rooms are great, the location is great, and the staff makes you feel like you are dealing with family. The staff goes up and above to help you in any way that you need from where to eat, to what to do and how to do it best fitting your pocketbook and your desires. We were only there a weekend but both my wife an I wish it was for much longer, however we will be going back and we will be staying here again. If you are looking for that special hotel that is not just a big chain name that caters to you and is beautiful you will not be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:54:05.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
