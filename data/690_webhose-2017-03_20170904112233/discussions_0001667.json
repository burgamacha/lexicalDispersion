We booked this hotel as it looked and sounded great with great reviews. It was everything we hoped and more. The staff truly are excellent at their job, they are genuine and friendly. The hotel is spotlessly clean. Our room was a queen size and perfect size for our stay. We had breakfast at the hotel most mornings which had fresh fruit, toasted bagels, croissants, eggs, yoghurt etc. Healthy good food. Unlimited tea, coffee, biscuits, pastries 24 hours. Wine, cheese and biscuits from 5-8. Unbelievable! All in Ricks Cafe which was really pleasant and comfortable. Of the 3 hotels I have stayed in NY, this was the best. I would highly recommend and would love to return to on my next visit .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:11:25.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
