Good location a few minutes walk from a tube station. Not the most attractive building from the outside but the inside was nicely decorated. My room was on the small side but was clean and had everything I needed. Dinner in the restaurant was served quickly by a charming waitress - standard food but it was OK. Breakfast was of usual standard too but I didn't have time to linger and take full advantage. Check in and out was efficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:57:12.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
