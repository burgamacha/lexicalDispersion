The hotel is so close to the Metro station which made sight seeing so easy to jump off and on. The hotel was clean and nice decor the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the extra step was the pocket WiFi the hotel gave us to take which was a great touch.\nWe didn't try breakfast as there were so many cafes around. Would happily stay again and would throughly recommend as great value for money A", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:38:05.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
