For a city centre hotel in such a prime spot the size of the room was acceptable and well-equipped with storage space. Breakfast is provided on site and room-service meals are ordered in from a nearby restaurant one hour after the order is made. There is a small bar in the lounge but no on-site restaurant facilities after breakfast. The Etoile Metro station is within 100 metres (red and green lines). The Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees are very close by with a great many restaurants in the immediate vicinity.\nRoom Tip: Inward facing rooms onto internal courtyard (e.g. 47) are almost silent.
