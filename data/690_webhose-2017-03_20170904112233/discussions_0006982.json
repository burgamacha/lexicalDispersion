The hotel staff was accommodating, super friendly and really enjoyed caring for their guest. The young man who checked us in was terrific helping us with a small problem and the door man found us parking right out front. Our room was clean and well stocked with everything you need. As we stay in the city quite a bit, we notice how quiet it was in this hotel. That's a plus in NYC. We eat at the restaurant and had a fabulous Cuban meal that was reasonably priced and the bar was so much fun!!! The hotel is in a great location as well. Overall I have to rate our weekend and this hotel A+.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:49:27.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
