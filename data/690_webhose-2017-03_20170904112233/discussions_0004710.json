I recently downloaded the 'One Night Standard' app and it's amazing. Friday night, my girlfriend and I were crushing it at karaoke in the village and didn't want to the party to end and did NOT want to go home to our significant others, so we booked a room through the app. We checked in at 230am and were greeted by Christopher, a surprisingly chipper guy working the front desk. He was super friendly and was able to get us into a bigger room than originally expected. We sat around in fancy robes, talked all night and had gourmet room service delivered at 4am.\nThe staff and accommodations at The Standard are consistently above par and this hotel chain will continue to be a staple of my life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:59:07.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
