Fortunately for me my expectations were more than exceeded.\nThe foyer speaks of days gone by when grandeur and excess were the norm in NYC hotels. The room wasn't massive however was clean and cozy. You are only really there to fall into bed after a busy day so unless you are planning to party in your room then more than enough space for crashing.\nA blizzard hit New York when I was staying for work which meant I was trapped for a day inside the hotel. This meant I got to speak with more of the staff than usual. They were to a fault fantastic, friendly and helpful. Even when the hot water wouldn't work for me, the maintenance person came up and had a laugh about the problem while fixing it for me at the same time.\nRoom service is slightly pricey but gets to you hot and tastes delicious.\nOverall this has defiantly surpassed my previous experiences in NYC especially with service. The team are genuinely interested in having a chat and bent over backwards to be helpful.\nGreat stay, great people, great location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:23:14.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
