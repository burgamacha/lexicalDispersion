We just happened to have good timing when we checked in and we got a nice upgrade because they were all out of the lower-cost rooms. We ended up with a 2-story corner room on the 10th floor that overlooked the Manhattan Bridge and lower Manhattan. It was quite epic for the price we paid. The first floor contained the bed and the 2nd floor we called \"the executive suite\" because it had a desk and work area. Both floors had a tv. The bathroom was spotless and was a nice size. Overall, the room was very clean. The carpet is suffering a bit, but it wasn't a major distraction. The front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful.\nIt's a great location. We felt safe walking to the hotel at 2am and we were right on the edge of Chinatown with Little Italy just a few blocks to the west.\nI would have no problem staying at the hotel again, even tho I'm quite sure we would most likely end up with their usual size rooms on a much lower floor!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:30:17.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
