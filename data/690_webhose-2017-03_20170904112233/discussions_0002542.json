When I checked in the receptionist was not as proactive in getting me to my room sooner than I would have liked. When the manager came over and recognized my status, she was very helpful and I appreciated her following up the next day as well about my room.\nI like the faster elevators and there is one dedicated for workers and housekeeping..unlike Doubletree. The Eastern European guy who makes breakfast is good...not many people can make pancakes well.\nHot water is an issue...it takes a long time or the water is lukewarm. Internet works fine in the room, but it is not seamless if you are moving through the hotel.\nI would return again. I liked the staff, breakfast and got a good sleep. I hope the water issue is fixed sooner than later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:22:28.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
