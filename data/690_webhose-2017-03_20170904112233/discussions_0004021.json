It certainly isn't a 4 stars in the sense of a almost luxury hotel (in a scale of 1 to 5). However, the staff was super friendly, location was perfect for us - coming by train is a 3 min walk from the Penn Station and close to everywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan.\nRoom was small, but very comfortable- bed felt like a cloud, shower was nice and warm and everything was clean. All the above yelds a 4 star on our book (again, we are not judging on luxury, but services and comfort).\nWe recommend it if you are on a budget and need somewhere clean, cozy and friendly to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:43:31.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
