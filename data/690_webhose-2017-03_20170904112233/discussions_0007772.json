My husband and I stayed at The Egerton House Hotel in order to celebrate my 40th birthday ... We wanted some luxury and T.L.C and this is what we received from the moment we stepped foot in the front door. On arrival we were informed that our room had been upgraded. Wow! Our room was beautiful. We were treated to a wonderful \"cream tea\" following our train journey. Evening drinks made extra special due to the relaxed atmosphere and the superb staff. That night our room was decorated with candles, chocolate dipped strawberries and rose petals ... a little touch organised by the wonderful Alex Shaw, front of house. I could go on and on as to how wonderful this hotel is ... but you must try it for yourself. It was just a delightful 2 night stay. Just heaven! Thank you all so very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:38:07.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
