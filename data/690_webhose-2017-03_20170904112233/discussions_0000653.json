The hotel is immaculately clean, it's decorated beautifully, the restaurants have amazing food and the service was fantastic! I highly recommend booking your room to include their breakfast buffet. The buffet has so many things to offer from traditional Asian food to, American food and even a juice bar. I usually am not a fan of buffets but we all looked forward to breakfast every morning. The pool is on the 26th floor with stunning views from both pool and hot tub. They will give you a swim cap to put your hair in and if you don't have your own, a pair of flip flops along with your pool towel. After a long day of walking in the city we really enjoyed sitting in the hot tub. We did not have time to exercise, but the gym on the 26th floor also looked fantastic. Who would mind running on the treadmill when you have such amazing views?? When we go back to Beijing, we definitely will stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:07:50.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
