I loved it; bijou (as they say in France) and welcoming, the staff were friendly and smiling every time we walked in the door. It's maybe 5 minutes walk from the Porte Dauphine metro and 25 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe making it the perfect base for exploring Paris. I highly recommend Hotel Residence Foch, Caroline and I will certainly be staying there again next time we're in Paris. Thanks to the staff for a lovely stay. HRF definitely deserves a full 5 across the board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:54:10.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
