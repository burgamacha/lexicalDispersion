The check in process was less than 10 minutes and our room was ready at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. We booked the duplex room with a wrap around balcony, the view of the Eiffel Tower, Madeleine church and the streets was breathtaking. The room itself was spacious and clean. Beds were very comfortable, bathroom was spotless. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, fresh croissant, fruit, eggs...etc. The subway station was only 1 block away. We also walked to many shops and museums, and it didn't seem far at all.\nOn our last night in Paris, our flight got cancelled and we had to extend our stay for one more night. The hotel manager was so gracious to honor same rate that we booked and didn't over charge us.\nIf I come back to Paris next time, I will definitely stay here again. I'm very satisfied with the hotel and service. It deserves a 5 star!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:39:25.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
