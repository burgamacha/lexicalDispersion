However once that was sorted we couldn't of had a better stay. Everything that you can think of was either in the room ( these are a bit small, but you cope)or if you forget Reception are more than pleased to supply you, Toothpate, Toothbrush, Razor, Shaving foam, nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and helpful staff. Ladies, no need to take a Hair dryer, iron, kettle all supplied, gives you more space and less weight in your case and room for all that NY shopping. We couln't fault this Hotel. Just one minor moan, the Dining Room is VERY small so breakfast can be a bit hectic\nRoom Tip: Rooms are cosy See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:29:34.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
