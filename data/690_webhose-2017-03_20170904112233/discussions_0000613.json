The location, just off the Champs Elysee, was perfect; the flowers and massive silver sculptures in the lobby were entrancing; the room was large, and comfortably furnished (with books to read, if bored); and the cosmopoiltan staff were unobtrusively efficient, welcoming, and happy to converse despite our rather imperfect French. True old-fashioned luxury.\nOn the other hand, in such a location, you too are part of the perfomance. So, though the experience was undoubtedly a highly enjoyable one, it was not wholly relaxing - and (or course) the cost of it all does not even bear thinking about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:32:38.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
