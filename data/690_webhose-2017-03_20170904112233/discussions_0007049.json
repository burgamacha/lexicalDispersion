Couldn't be any more helpful. Very friendly. Stayed in the King, Empire View Room (1908) and Room was lovely... and food in the resturant was very nice. Bar lady who worked in the evening, so friendly and great to chat with for both my partner and I. The only minor negative is the rooms can be noisy... something that may not be able to do anything about but opening and closing of doors can be heard in our room and one particular night we thought customers were having a good long chat in the hallway at 1am in the morning waking us up, but in fact they were in their room. As I say, probably nothing that can be done about that. Maybe a polite notice in rooms to say keep noise down after 10/11pm or something. But... That was very minor as our stay was perfect and absolutely amazing. Great location, great clean room and very very friendly and helpful staff. Couldn't ask for anything more. Will be staying here again next March when we return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:15:17.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
