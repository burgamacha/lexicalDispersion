We planned a short family trip for the spring and found this good offer for a 5-star hotel in the same house with a world-famous PG restaurant. The reviews for the hotel were not the highest, so we were prepared for \"just fine\" level. BUT! :) Everything we experienced was over any expectations. The hospitality of the staff from the first to the last minute was perfect. In a way we enjoyed the size of the lobby and a kind of \"hidden\" doorway. It was like coming home, Dear Friends!\nRoom size - good even for 3 of us!\nRoom cleanliness- perfect\nBreakfast- good standard for Paris\nWe used a lot of help and asked for advices from the concierge and other employees and we were really happy with the results!\nIf there was anything to change then that would be a slight refurnishing the back hall of breakfast room, but this didn't affect any of our pleasure.\nPlease use this home-like and fair-priced luxury close to AdT.\nKatrin, Indrek, Mia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:01:46.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
