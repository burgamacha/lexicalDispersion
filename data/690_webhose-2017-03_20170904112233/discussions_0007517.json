I have stayed at the hotel on two occasions while on business and with my family over the Dec / Jan holiday season. On each occasion the quality of the service has been excellent; both friendly and efficient! The rooms are luxurious and the bathrooms elegant and very clean. The hotel in general has tremendous style while not compromising on comfort. After a days work or sightseeing in London it is a pleasure to return to the hotel where you are always met by friendly and engaging staff for whom nothing ever seems to be too much trouble. The hotel's location is fantastic situated in one of London's finest areas and within easy walking distance to some of the world's leading and loved museums. I could go on but suffice to say that the Ampersand is a special place in a special part of London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:27:57.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
