I explained to her that since I was one person, why waste that room that might be needed for someone who does need it? Regardless of this logic I was given a room with two beds!\nThe room I was given was a pretty long walk from the reception and I thought I was going back to King's Cross!\nThe room was pretty nice, the shower was good, and the bed (well beds, both them, I did try them both!) was really comfy.\nFood from room service was nice, but the service was a little slow, the hotel wasn't busy at all so I dread to think what it's like when it's packed!\nI had an issue with my Hilton Honors account as the stay wasn't registering on the app. The rude woman from reception had been clueless as to why and then the guy the next morning when I checked out was equally clueless, but the problem was the way they spoke to me and the fact that they knew very little about their own loyalty product.\nTo be totally fair the chap in the morning did call me back and the points did, after a bit of a delay, credit to my account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:30:11.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
