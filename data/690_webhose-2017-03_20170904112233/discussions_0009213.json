The hotel was very clean. The staff polite and helpful. The breakfast area was clean with a continental style breakfast. As much as you want to eat. The room we had was roomy with a very modern en suit . Nice comfy bed with TV . No coffee or tea making equipment but it did have an hair dryer. .\nThe free wi-fi was poor though on my phone, I often had no reception.\nGetting into Rome on foot would take around 40 minutes, there was a bus service across the road for 6-7 Euros. You have to pre buy a ticket from a kiosk near by .\nAll in all a pleasant 3 day stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:02:10.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
