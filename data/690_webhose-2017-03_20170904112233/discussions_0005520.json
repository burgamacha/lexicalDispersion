The was for sure also the result of advice given by the hotel staff and personal attention during our stay. Upon arrival the reception staff gave us wonderful advice on how to visit the major sites best and how to get there. Breakfast buffet was amazing and also here friendly staff. Victoria who worked the bar in the evening did everything to make us feel good in Rome. Again it was Laura at the reception who told us where to get the tiramisu in Rome (POMPI, you should try this). If I had to make our end critical remark it was the airco that was not yet operating. Opening the windows was quite noisy. But the beds where very good so that almost balanced out. We will go back again. For sure", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:52:59.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
