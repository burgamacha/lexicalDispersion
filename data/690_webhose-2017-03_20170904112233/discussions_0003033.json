This stunning little hotel had everything we needed and was placed perfectly for our first time visit.\nFirstly the hotel staff were friendly,full of information about the local area and they couldn't do enough for you. One night we came back late from a show and we were hungry and the male rectiopionist got the Indian next door to stay open just for us. If that's not going out of his way I don't know what is. (Lovely meal too definatley recommend)\nThey have thought of everything to make your stay perfect, it was raining whilst we were here so we were given a large umbrella for our stay!\nRooms - our room was small but stylish and well equipped with anything you might need and the best part about it was the little balcony with a view of the Eiffel Tower and bustling street below. We enjoyed many hours sitting here watching the lit up tower. Very romantic.\nI have nothing bad to say, it's close to everything including the train from Charles de Gaulle airport (which we got and walked 2 mins straight to the hotel) if we'd have wanted a taxi the hotel themselves would have arranged this.\nIf it's your first or 100th time in Paris this place is perfectly located for everywhere, lots of little cafes and restaurants all around, the tower is minutes away and I reccomend the big bus tour to get to know your surroundings.\nWe will definatley be back.\nHOTEL ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nSTAFF ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nLOCATION⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nROOM⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:24:55.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
