I travel all over the world, always stay at 5 star or better, even comparing it with the Ritz Carlton . I would say Four seasons Beijing is an excellent hotel. Friendly staff, excellent food, excellent spa. Food being the most important to me, exceeds my expectations. Being in the financial industry and travels all the time, I think I'm sold on the service at the Four Seasons hotel. I always write blogs on my travels, with total honesty, if I don't like one thing about a hotel or service industry, I always want them and the public to know about it. This hotel truly exceeded my expectations. I would like to give two thumbs up to the management team at the Four Seasons Beijing. Fantastic atmosphere.\nThank you\nDave sohal\nSRF Financial Inc\nCanada", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:09:13.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
