The service was impeccable. We asked for adjoining rooms and were given great corner rooms (adjoining). Both bars were extraordinary (rooftop bar = spectacular view). since our daughters are not 21 years of age, they were not allowed in the rooftop bar. During the day (when the bar was not open),security escorted them up so they could see the view of the Empire Sate Building and take a 'selfe'. Room service was delicious and delivered when promised. I would highly recommend this hotel. (The only reason I did not give it 5-stars, is because I rarely give 5-stars.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:33:48.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
