The hotel is just a short walk from Roma Termini on Via Firenze. It is a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Via Nazionale in It's own quiet corner. The hotel occupies a floor in a mixed use building. The rooms are a nice size and feature updated bathrooms. Breakfast is included in the price and there is a patio where you can relax with your juice and pastry. After an afternoon of sightseeing the patio is a nice place to wind down with a bottle of wine. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:32:16.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
