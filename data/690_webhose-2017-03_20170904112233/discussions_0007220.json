Twin room was good size with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was a decent size & nice big shower. Breakfast was fine, it's what I would call a limited buffet offering, but no complaints about the quality or quantity of food on offer. Only gripe would be that the coffee machines seem to use instant coffee rather than beans. WiFi was free, coverage was really good and excellent speed too. I think the price for a twin room with breakfast was very good (Â£104) and I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to anyone.\nThere appears to be a nightclub (or similar) at the rear of the hotel, so if you're a light sleeper then you might want to ask for a room away from this area. The hotel do provide ear plugs though (nice touch I thought) and you are in a city centre, so not unreasonable to expect a bit of noise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:49:03.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
