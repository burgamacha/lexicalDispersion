The reservation was made by my company's travel agent and was for four nights including daily breakfast. I checked in around 4pm. I did have to remind the desk attendant that the reservation included breakfast. He disagreed, but finally found it, \"in very small print on the reservation.\" I wouldn't usually consider this a problem, but my colleague mentioned they did the same thing to him even when he showed them the confirmation.\nThe property is nice and the neighborhood is fabulous, very close to a ton of restaurants and shopping as well as a short walk to the Pont Neuf and surrounding attractions. It didn't seem like the hotel was even close to booked because I rarely saw other guests and there was never more than one or two other tables at breakfast. Perhaps that was just because at 25EUR, breakfast didn't really seem worthwhile. The food was fine, but had I not been on business, I would've opted to eat elsewhere.\nMy room was on the fifth floor and it was tiny! By tiny, I mean so small there was no place to leave my carry-on sized suitcase open. There was definitely no view to speak of, just a sort of alley behind the hotel. However, it had all the necessities. The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains worked well. The shower was a bit confusing, but once you figured it out, the water pressure was good. There was a good sized closet with a safe and extra blankets/pillows for the bed as well as a pricey minibar. The biggest problem for me was noise from the room above, which really wasn't the hotel's fault. I have no idea what was happening, but they were making such a racket, it woke me up out of a deep sleep at 2am on a Monday morning... This happened on other nights as well, albeit a bit earlier.\nI misplaced my receipt when I got home and since I needed it for expenses, I emailed the hotel. They were very quick to send me a copy which I greatly appreciated. The staff was friendly and helpful.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:14:32.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
