Great welcome from the concierge Christopher, with the offer of coffee or tea in the comfortable reception area.\nRoom was small but perfectly formed. Very clean with tea/coffee making facilities. Area was very quiet when we were there.\nGreat recommendations for dinner options, though no restaurant in the hotel. Breakfast was served in the small area downstairs, and was good.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would certainly consider staying again - they can offer adjoining rooms for if you are travelling with family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:33:09.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
