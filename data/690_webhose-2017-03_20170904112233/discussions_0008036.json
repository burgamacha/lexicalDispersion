The hotel itself is located in a nice quiet square where there are many substandard hotels, but the really nice thing we liked was the English Breakfast.\nthe service was top class, freshly squeezed orange juice, which we helped our self too. Nice coffee, great eggs but the bacon was the best I have ever had. The room was a good size, very cozy and the shower room looked like it was recently refurbished.\nI have already booked for our return trip next month as they had limited availability and didn't want to lose out. Very nice staff as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:35:45.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
