It's an excellent hotel with large rooms and well appointed too. Two TV's was a bonus and a nice lounge/study area with a couch, single chair and writing desk. Two basins in the bathroom and a shower and bath. Not many English TV channels to choose from was a slight let down.\nThe breakfast restaurant (Eat 33) was excellent with a huge choice, just one tip, the room is seriously heated so ask for a table near the door or dress lightly.\nWe ate input room on two occasions and the meals were very good and service very quick. There is a Family Mart just one block back (behind the Marriott ) which sells all the basics. The pedestrian street with lots of shopping malls is a 5 minute walk.\nWell worth the stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:21:17.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
