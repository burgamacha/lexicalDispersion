The hotel is cinema themed and the decor is really cool. Our room was spotlessly clean. The rooms have everything you could want including mini fridge with complimentary water and soft drinks, safe, hair dryer and the bathroom has L'Occitane products. Wifi is available (no extra charge). There is a wide range of food available for breakfast, and everything we tasted was really good. The hotel also provides free snacks and coffees during the day. It is centrally located near the metro and is about 25min walk to La Louvre. Staff were very friendly and really helpful. Definitely recommended if you are staying in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:45:08.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
