The street the window is facing is not busy and the blinds come all the way down so you can't hear anything. The room is somewhat soundproof and the double glazed windows really help keeping an optimum temperature and the noise away.\nThe size of the room and the toilet were great, not too big abs not too small and we had anything we could need (mini bar, wardrobes, mini office, robes, sleepers, etc..). They give complimentary toiletries every day and the bed is very comfortable. The shower was fantastic and the toilet works as both a toilet and a bidet, which I though was great.\nThe guys at reception were always willing to help with directions, restaurant recommendations, train times and anything we could ask for. The location is fantastic, half a minute away from Ettiene Marcel and about 2 minutes from Les Halles- chatelet so it was very easy to get anywhere by foot or even to reach outside locations such as Disneyland Paris.\nVery good hotel, I would definitely stay there again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:54:32.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
