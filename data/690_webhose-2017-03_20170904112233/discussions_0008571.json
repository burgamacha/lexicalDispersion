They had chocolates waiting for us in the room as a little gift, which was a very sweet touch. Bathroom was beautiful marble and our room was spacious. Perfect location--very close to two different metro stations, and in walking distance from most things depending on how far you will walk. Check-in was super easy. We went to Scotland for two days during our trip, and not wanting to take our huge luggage, the hotel agreed to hold our big bags until we got back even though we had already checked out-making it easy to take little duffel bags for our quick trip.\nThere was a great little bar downstairs, and they also gave us a complimentary cocktail for our anniversary, too.\nWould highly recommend.\nRoom Tip: Ask for whatever you need and someone will accommodate you.
