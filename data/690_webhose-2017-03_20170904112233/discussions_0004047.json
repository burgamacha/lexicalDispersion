We chose it due to its excellent location to Times Square, subway and tourist bus links on Broadway! The room was a good size and cleaned daily, with 4 ladies in one room we could have done with more storage/hanging space. The breakfast was included and a great bonus it can get a little busy at peak times. The staff at the desk very friendly and helpful we had a problem with our bags being delayed which they helped. Would definitely stay here again great value for money. Great views of Empire State Building from our room", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:48:27.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
