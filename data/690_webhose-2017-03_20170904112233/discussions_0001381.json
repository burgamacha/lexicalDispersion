Breakfast is very nice. If you have an aversion to stairs, get over it! The elevator was installed after the hotel was built and is situated at l/2 floors! Yup. 1/2 floors...spent three nights there. Location is fabulous. Street in front under construction...but should be done by summer....Staying in Montparnesse is a treat and is where we always stay....this hotel was our first....we will stay again. However, do not use the shuttle that they have brochures for. They are terrible! I cannot remember the name, but stay away. We were to be picked up at 7:40...he arrived at 7:30 and was annoyed that we were not ready....he picked up four add'l people and at 8:37 we were not out of Paris yet to head to the airport. Unacceptable. He refused to go to our terminal and set both my sister and I out with our four bags at the end of Terminal 2....approximately two football fields from our departure gate. We are both in need of wheelchairs at airports. He refused to take us to the door to Delta. Beware!.\nRoom Tip: All rooms are the same: small with a double bed...twins pushed together.
