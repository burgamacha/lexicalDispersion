We have been allocated a deluxe room with contemporary design, we kept looking around and was in awesome at how romantic & beautiful it looked!\nOn the top of that, the team surprised us with champagne and chocolate cake in the room and we were all pleasantly amazed with the rose petals in heart shape on bed…… it was such a gorgeous treat for celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary.\nWe really appreciate Mr. Florian Buat and his excellent team, they are so attentive and kind-throughout. The amazing staff for putting together such an incredibly memorable & beautiful day for our special occasion.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:05:14.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
