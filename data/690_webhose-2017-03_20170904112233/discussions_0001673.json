Coming from the States it was great to see so much service. Service level was truly excellent. If you need any advice, Ben at the concierge desk will give you advice on the good play to go visit, the right tourist attractions and in our cases what restaurants to visit.\nThe front desk was as helpful, food was phenomenal. The decor is extremely tasteful, stairwell is fantastic.\nTruly excellent housekeeping service. We didn't eat much at the hotel but we had a couple of breakfasts and they didn't disappoint.\nLocation is perfect, walking distance to a tremendous amount of spots.\nWould love to go Back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:47:04.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
