Elegant and quaint. The receptionist, Louis was very helpful and friendly. We were given an upgrade as I was a Hilton Honors Diamond member. However finding the main entrance is quite challenging. The taxi driver drop us in the middle of the street as the traffic was not moving. We had to pull our luggage in the train and took about 10mins to find the entrance.\nThe lobby looks grand though. Room is nice and spacious overlooking the mall itself. Had breakfast on two mornings and find the service totally different in the two morning. So I think the service is complacent.\nBelow the mall there are RER and Metro system. So it's convenient to get around without having to take taxi and can be quite costly. Travellers kept saying Singapore is expensive. That because they have not try taxis is Paris I guess. 15 mins journey cost us â‚¬36. While in Singapore it will cost $15 with traffic.\nHope to visit this favourite city of mine soon and stay at this lovely hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:14:46.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
