We have been to Paris a number of times, all at different hotels, so have some previous experience to gage this against. We found the hotel to be very friendly and welcoming and very well equipped in the room, with safe, iron & board, hair dryer, tea & coffee, complimentary bottle of water, mini bar etc. Our room was very comfortable and a pretty good size for Paris. Location was great and we easily walked to Louvre, Champs Elysees and Opera. In the past we have used the Metro but really glad we chose not to this time and decided to walk and see so much more. The staff at the hotel were always friendly and helpful, especially Emmanuel. We would certainly return here without question and happily with the kids also. There was some traffic noise in the room but nothing more than you would get in any centrally located hotel in Paris and not enough to disturb our sleep but if you like it quiet, best not stay in the heart of the city. Hotel is close to the Metro so easily reached from Gard du Nord but if you prefer a taxi you should make sure you only get into a G7 taxi as they are the regulated ones using meters. They all clearly have G7 on the cabs and from station to the hotel should be 15-20 Euro depending on traffic. Don't take the ones that approach you directly at the station, they will be very persistent, as they will not use the meters and will charge a flat fee of 55 Euro!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:29:36.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
