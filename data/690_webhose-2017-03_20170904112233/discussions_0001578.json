We loved the quirkyness of the old buildings.\nBreakfast was enough to set you up for a busy day ahead,although the room it was in was very small and we struggled to get a clean table.\nLocation was perfect for seeing the sights.\nThe only negative we had was the man on reception when we checked out was one of the rudest people ever.Which is a shame as we was happy with everything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:38:51.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
