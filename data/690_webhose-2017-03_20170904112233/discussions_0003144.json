Each room is individually decorated and the lobby is Art Noveau style. Very hip and funky. Not a bland corporate place. The hotel provides free yogurt and granola for breakfast. The staff is very friendly and helpful.\nThere is a fair amount of background city noise - could be a problem for light sleepers.\nRoom Tip: If staying with a friend, the rooms with Hardwood floors and twin beds are great.
