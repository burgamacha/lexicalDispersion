Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Charlotte who helped us find places to eat every night which suited our taste. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet and had a projector instead of a tv which my partner was very happy with...very modern! We were both surprised it was only a 3 star. The room was cleaned daily and always looked immaculate.\nThe hotel is situated in a quiet part of Paris with small restaurants nearby, however, is just a half hour walk to the busier, more touristic part of the city where the Eiffel Tower and Louvre etc are located. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel taking you right outside the touristic places in about 10 minutes. There are a number of supermarkets nearby too if any essentials are required.\nNeither of us ate the food from the hotel but there was a breakfast buffet every morning for â‚¬5 which looked good! There was also a happy hour every evening from 18:00-20:00 which included wine and cheeses which was great!\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel and would 100% stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:55:00.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
