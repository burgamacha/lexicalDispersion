Hotel located on Blackfriars Road about 10 minutes walk from River Thames and 3 minutes walk from Southwark tube station. Easy walking to St. Paul's, London Eye, Southbank, Tower Bridge, Westminster. Room 1309 clean and comfortable. Breakfast very good.\nThe bathroom has a walk in shower. On our first morning I did slip over in the walk-in shower. Slipped backwards and went full length on the very slippy floor. Cut my elbow and bruised my back but fortunately nothing serious. There is no anti-slip coating on shower tray floor so it gets very slippy. There is a notice on the bathroom mirror noting that bath mats are available from reception but it is a very small notice and as such overlooked. I believe providing a bath mat in the bathroom for guests immediate use will help to prevent what could be a very serious accident happening in the future.\nOtherwise a pleasant stay with friendly staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:50:29.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
