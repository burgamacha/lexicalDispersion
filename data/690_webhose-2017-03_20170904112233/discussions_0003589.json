We love the location between the Marais and the Bastille, and very close to the wonderful market in the Boulevard Richard Lenoir. There are 4 metro stations within easy walking distance, buses nearby and cycles to hire.\nHaving stayed here a few times we felt that there had been a signifiant improvement in the decor and the helpfulness of the staff, who were without fail helpful and welcoming. Not just the reception but housekeeping and maintenance as well.\nThe one bed apartment was spacious and comfortable for 10 days. The bed was a little hard, I would have loved the luxury of an oven in the kitchen but to be fair it is not necessary. The kitchen is well equipped. Good choice of TV channels, very fast wifi, but somehow streaming does not seem possible\nWe would not hesitate to return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:37:26.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
