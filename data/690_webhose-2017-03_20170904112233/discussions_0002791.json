I would stay in this hotel again and I definitely recommend this hotel to friends. The Staff was wonderful to me and everything I requested for my family was provided, it is a great place for families, I have a 2 year old and a 2 month old and it was perfect for us. The staff knew that my first night I was by myself with the babies as my husband was out of town and they help me the luggage and with everything I need it. Breakfast was amazing the coffee was just the way I like it. I loved this hotel\nRoom Tip: Perfect quiet and a wonderful view. The bed was super big and very spacious.
