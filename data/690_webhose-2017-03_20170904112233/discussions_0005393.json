The woman at the desk when I arrived was super nice and helpful, and the next day there was a blizzard, (my appointment was cancelled and I had to stay an extra day. Yippee!) But the nice woman was here, literally, for 2 and a half days straight! She never lost her smile or helpfulness. As for amenities, there is a gym, an \"office\", where I printed out my new ticket home, and a great breakfast from 7-9. (I always wish these things would run till 10, but that is just me) The worst thing about this place is the temperature controller. I had 2 tutorials from the nice woman at the desk, and googled the instructions. But I could not figure out how to keep it as I wanted. Anyway, I love it here. There is a lot of good places to eat within walking distance. Subway is close, also. I couldn't find a CVS type store, but I did find a wine store, and it delivers! There is a print out telling of all the local businesses. I was completely comfy here. Also, my appointment was at the Hospital that was a 7 minute walk from here.
