I would not stay in any other part of Paris now. It was perfect. The neighbourhood was just delightful, small streets, many cafes and beautiful small independent shops. It felt totally safe and was in easy walking distance to many attractions including the Norte Dame. I loved the hotel, and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I had mentioned it being my birthday when booking, so they upgraded us to a deluxe room and presented me with a bottle of Hermes spray - a very nice touch. Breakfast was plentiful and set you up for the day. They even had an honesty bar at night. They play great music n the evenings too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:30:39.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
