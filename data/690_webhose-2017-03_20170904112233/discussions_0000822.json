I wanted a quiet room and shuttle to the airport. Hyatt delivered. Grace, at the front desk, took about 2 mins to make sure I had the most quiet room ever and provided excellent customer service. The hostess at the bar also helped me with getting me a snack for breakfast since I was leaving long before the kitchen would be open. Shuttle was very fast to the airport (from the airport is much slower). Would stay here again in a heartbeat", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:32:42.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
