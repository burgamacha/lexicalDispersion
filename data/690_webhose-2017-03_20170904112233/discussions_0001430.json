The hotel is next to subway station Chong Wen Men (Lines 2 and 5) so it's easy to going around the city. There’s no lift in the exit, so prepare to carry your luggage up.\nThe room was spacious and clean. But the room was warm, the aircon wasn’t working. We asked the staff about it and they said that because it’s winter so the aircon only blowing warm air. Well, we expected our room to be cool not warm.\nGot WIFI in the room.\nThe concierge staffs was helpful too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:49:19.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
