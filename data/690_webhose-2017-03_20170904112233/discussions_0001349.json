When we checked-in, we were delighted to learn that we had been upgraded - without asking - to a larger room. I happened to mention that it was my birthday and that the upgrade was appreciated. Once in the room, a staff member surprised us with complementary champagne and a birthday note from the general manager, Meredith Morgan. I should also mention that when we went to breakfast the next morning, the maitre d' acknowledged my birthday. What a wonderful thing that they make sure that staff are aware of things like a birthday! The room, located on the 5th floor was spacious and comfortable. The walls were white and the room somewhat sparsely decorated, but had nice high ceilings, hard wood floors and high wooden European-style carved doors (the kind you find in Vienna). The bathroom was separate from the walk-in shower, which was nice. Overall, a very nice room. Hotel is quite lovely. We had afternoon tea in the library, which was quaint and lovely. We also had breakfast in the dining room, which was very cozy. Food was great and staff were very polite and professional. It was a little hard to do valet service when we arrived because broadway is narrow due to parking and a bike lane. Best to call the hotel prior to pulling up if you need valet service or assistance unloading baggage. All in all, an exceptional experience at a very reasonable rate ($275 per night). We thank the management and staff for making my birthday stay so delightful and look forward to returning!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:51:58.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
