Granted we had a king bed but you had to squeeze past each other to move around. Everything was small--the closet, even the tiny bedside tables. The bathroom wasn't so bad, relatively speaking.\nThere is no parking at this site, however there is a parking garage adjacent that charges $35 a day. This was reasonable to us after driving for eight hours and sitting in horrible local traffic for the last two hours.\nThe Queen's Plaza subway station is about 50 yards away and was very convenient for us.\nRoom Tip: Check your thermostat. We like it cool and could not get the room temp below 71 so we turned it off.
