On both stays, we were very pleased by this hotel. The staff was very friendly and proactive. They kept a small piece of luggage for us in between the 2 stays. On the 2nd stay, we were accomodated (with delays) with an early check-in. A couple of downsides: the breakfast... OMG that was awful on both stays. The food doesn't taste anything, the hot buffet was somewhat cold and NO healthy choice AT ALL. There is not even milk or cream for your coffee, only flavored creamers. To be honest, even if the breakfast is included, you should look at other options in the area. One other thing: during our 2nd stay, the room we got had a very noisy fridge and a ceiling fan that ran all night long... we didn't sleep at all... When I told the staff the next morning, they said that this fan is linked to the kitchen exhaust fan... No excuse, No compensation, no nothing... At least, they should put a notice somewhere in the rooms...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:21:40.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
