The rooms are tiny, but they have everything you need - a bed, tv, internet connection and shower with toilet. For one person the room is excellent - but for two the double room feels crowded. There is some noise from inside the hotel - mainly the water pipes \"singing\", so if you are a light sleeper I recommend brining ear plugs. The staff at the reception are very friendly and helpful. And the room price includes a glass of wine and cheese every evening from 5 to 7 (or 8). If you don't tend to spend a lot of time in your room, the Z-hotel is a good option for a short city break - 1 or 2 nights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:15:45.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
