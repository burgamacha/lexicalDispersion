I booked the reservation as part of a flight/hotel package so I'm not sure what I paid for the hotel, but the package deal was very reasonable.\nThe hotel was well appointed, clean and quiet. Our room was ready when we arrived straight from the airport at 9am, which was very convenient, rather than having to wait for the afternoon check-in time. Hotel staff were very professional, welcoming and helpful. We did not use the food services, bar or exercise facilities and so can not comment on those.\nThe hotel is conveniently near the South Kensington and Gloucester road tube stops, so getting around London was very easy. There are a good variety of food options within a short walk.\nIn every way, our experience at the Kensington was great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:54:34.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
