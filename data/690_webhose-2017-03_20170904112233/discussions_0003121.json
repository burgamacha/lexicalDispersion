Very modern, clean and homey. The staff was awesome, super helpful and made sure we were as comfortable as we can be.\nVery close to Victoria Station, 5 minute walk max.\nAnd did I mention the room was amazing.\nIt is small, but so comfortable and seductive that the size gave an intimate feeling. I slept like a baby and definitely made me want to stay longer in London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:10:31.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
