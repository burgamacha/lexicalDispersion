The amazing front desk personnel took such good care of me. I was escorted to a room that looked and smelled heavenly. When it was time to bath and get into bed, The Warwick didn't disappoint. I had two short days but it required all my will to get out of the luxurious bed. The linens were sparkling clean and pillows wrapped my tired mind in comfort. You can have a perfect room but without the great staff, it's just a room. The Warwick is a five star hotel made affordable for a working class person. The guys at the front door were fun and directed me wherever I asked. The concierge provided maps and was a veritable search engine with a smile. I have found my hotel where I can always go, count on down to earth yet completely professional staff. Forgive the length of this review but, to say any less would have been dishonest. Thank you Warwick, I cannot wait to return. You made my trip one to remember. Feel free to use my name.\nRoom Tip: I only know my one room and it was as if I had the entire floor to myself; heavenly.
