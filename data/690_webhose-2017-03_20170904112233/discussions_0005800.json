These Soldiers are fairly new to Hilton property stays, and how the point system works. Ms. Slay was exceptional at check in. I am a Diamond member so my breakfast was included with my stay. Ms. Slay saw the Soldiers and immediately stepped in to assist during check in. Most managers simply smile and say thank you for your service, but Ms.Slay was hands on. As a Veteran myself, I want to THANK HER, for her service to our current Service men and women. Because of her dedication and attentiveness to the US Military, I will ensure that my future classes stay at this property (as long as its within per diem) THANK YOU AGAIN DAISY SLAY.\nRoom Tip: The bellman was AWESOME as well. Parking is pricey but though. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:41:52.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
