We had a wonderful stay! Upon arrival the receptionist was friendly, he recommended a local gelato which we tried on the last night and it was so delicious! There were queues out the door!! Definitely try it if you can!\nAlso the bell service was great, sherwin carried our luggage up to the room and told us everything that was included in the room, he was lovely!\nThe maids were great, every evening we came back to a spotless room which is exactly what you want after a long day of walking! They changed our bed sheets everyday and even tidied our phone cables lol! Mini bar is free and what we drank was refilled every day! They also opened the windows so when we came back the room had fresh air!\nThe breakfast was nice! Typical continental breakfast but the ladies managing breakfast were lovely, very friendly! The freshly squeezed orange juice is divine!! They bring you a glass to the table along with a Italian coffee!\nAlso when checking out we could leave our luggage in the concierge which was locked securely. When we collected our luggage we noticed they had bagged our drinks from the room that we accidentally left behind and put it with our luggage which was so nice!! We didn't even realise we had left anything but it was a nice touch!\nThe gym and sauna is lovely, we wished we had our costume with us because it looked fab!!\nUnfortunately we didn't get to see all we wanted to see in Rome so will hopefully return in the next year and we look forward to staying at the hotel again! We wouldn't stay anywhere else now!!\nGratsie!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:29:41.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
