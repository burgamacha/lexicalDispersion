Have stayed at the Sanderson & Mondrian in the same group before & loved them.\nAs soon as we arrived the valet men (& may I say super smartly dressed, knowledgeable & handsome!) parked the car for us.\nThe lovely Isabelle upgraded us to a superior room (gorgeous corner light filled room 524). Super comfy bed & pillows. Great shower & products.\nLater on we had a bottle of prosecco delivered to the room compliments of the hotel for our wedding anniversary.\nWe had a drink in the bar before dinner elsewhere. Check out was 12pm, which was fabulous as we had escaped children to relax for 24 hours!!\nAll in all every member of staff we encountered were polite & helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay & would not hesitate to book again. Thank you all for making our anniversary perfect x", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:21:35.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
