Beautiful hotel, impeccably clean and well presented. 2 minutes walk from Placide metro station. All staff very friendly and most helpful. Paid extra for room overlooking Eiffel Tower and Montparnasse tower - both illuminated at night. Lovely private terrace with table and chairs - well worth the extra expense for a real treat. Breakfast included - wide selection of hot and cold and served in relaxing and spacious dining area.\nWill definitely make this our 'go to ' in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:52:32.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
