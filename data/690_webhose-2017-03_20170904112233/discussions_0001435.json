It has no frontage and if the front door is not open you need to ring the bell on the right to get attention. The door is open from early on in the morning until about six. The hotel reception is 24 hours and is on the first floor - there is a lift.\nThe hotel is very close to Termini and two minutes from Repubblica Metro. There are several buses that rattle into the Centro Storico you can get round the corner in Via Nazionale.\nBooked direct with the hotel and got a good deal for settling in cash.\nReception staff all very efficient, polite and friendly. I only needed them to book a taxi transfer back to Fumicinio but got the impression they would be happy to sort out tickets, reservations etc without a drama.\nWe had a late flight and there was no problem leaving our bags all day.\nRooms very pleasant, clean, decent sized shower, equally good sized bed.\nBreakfast next door in the Cotto had everything you might want.\nPerfect for a week's break - we would definitely recommend and use again when next in Roma.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:43:33.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
