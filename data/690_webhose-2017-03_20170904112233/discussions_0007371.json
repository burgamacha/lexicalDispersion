Easy walking distance to Tube stations (unfortunately Lancaster Gate is closed till July 2017 but others are close). The room(s) we had (101) was large and very comfortable. Great bed, shower and drawing room. Obviously converted from a large old house, judging by the passageway (with a useful wardrobe/safe/coffee maker etc) between drawing room and bedroom. Very quiet area with a lot of expensive cars parked nearby. Not great if you are driving as nowhere to park, but good if like us you are on the trains.\nRoom Tip: I think they will all be good. Lift to all floors. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:22:08.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
