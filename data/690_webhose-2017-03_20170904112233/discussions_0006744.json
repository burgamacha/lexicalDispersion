Both were spacious with everything you could need and very clean. Large comfortable beds and surprisingly quiet inside and out. Lovely location - very convenient for the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and V&A. Decent places to eat nearby and 5 minutes walk to nearest tube stations. Helpful staff. Continental breakfast included in the price or you can upgrade to full English for Â£3 each. They were happy to keep our luggage all day after we'd checked out. Rooms at the back don't have very nice views, better at the front with big bay windows. Would definitely recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Rooms at the front have nicer views. Road is quiet so no problem with noise. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:11:21.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
