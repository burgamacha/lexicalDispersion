The room was huge. Massive bed. Very comfortable. Lovely toiletries and the sleep spray really does work. Great breakfast in the morning with a wide choice. Only thing missing was porridge. Would definitely recommend. One minute from Gloucester Road tube station. 10 - 15 min walk to the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park. Very convenient for the museums.
