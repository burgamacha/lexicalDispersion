The hotel is kept really well heated.Even though February we had to put the air conditioner on.\nYou have 6 lifts at the hotel and each time we used them they were pretty speedy but when the weekend arrived we did have to wait a long time and even took the stairs on one occasion all the way down from the 18th but we waited to get the lift back up!\nYou can eat and drink at the Roosevelt but we found some great cafes across the road on 5th Avenue that were cheap,cheerful and the food tasted great so we ate in different 5th Avenue cafes all week.\nThe Roosevelt is a stones throw from Times Square and Grand Central Station.Central to everything really.You won't get a better placed hotel.\nOnly one negative comment and that is the desk staff,some were really helpful but some were downright rude.\nIf you need help,directions etc,ask the doorman who were all really friendly and approachable.\nWe would definitely stay here again..loved it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:07:07.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
