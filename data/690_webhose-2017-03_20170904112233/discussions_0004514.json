This property was ideally located in the center of Paris, with convenient airport links and the train/metro service to all of the cities best sights. The Eiffel tower was a 5 - 10 minute train ride away, however do not be put off by the idea of the rail line just outside as the rooms were very quiet and no noise could be heard from them even during the night.\nThe staff are friendly and welcoming, happy to help you with booking transfers or arranging reservations. Most staff also speak English, which is helpful if you've not brushed up on your French.\nRooms were cleaned daily, and the style was modern and simplistic which was perfect for the price you pay. Amazing views of the Eiffel Tower can be seen from the front facing rooms, it's worth putting in the request just to see it light up in the evening.\nLocation of the hotel is perfect for families, couples or single travelers. Monoprix is just next door where you can pick up traditional French food or wine at a much cheaper price than from Duty Free. There are several restaurants and cafes such as Cafe Le Pierrot, where you can have a lovely meal or evening drink.\nI'd fully recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a memorable trip to Paris, from the comfort style and reception we were given from the staff this is a property I'd happily return to.\nRoom Tip: Request a view of the Eiffel Tower, or higher up room See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:00:17.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
