The bed was a full sized bed, NOT a Queen. When I made the reservation I specified that there would be 2 people. Only my name was on the reservation and you gave me a very small room. It was too small for 2 people. The very good rating was based on location and service, not the room. Also, the electric outlets on the desk did not work properly. We were only able to use one of them. They need repair.\nRoom Tip: I don't know what you're looking for here. Room tip??
