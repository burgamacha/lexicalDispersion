Every time I am in Paris I always stay here because of walking distance to Louvre, Tulieries Gardens, Opera Garnier, Place Vendome, Place Madeleine with its gourmet shops and Place de la Concorde. It only takes 10 minutes or less by walk to reach the hotel from Opera Garnier Roissy bus station (CDG airport bus). Last time we stayed in a renovated room with a beautiful view of opposite houseÂ´s frenchie window shutters. It is absolutely lovely to look on the quiet street early morning from the window decorated by lovely geraniums. Bathroom was newly renovated, spacious, clean. What I have to stress out is absolutely fantastic, helpful and friendly approach of Mr Mourad who is the soul and spirit of this hotel. When he is behind the reception desk its more a friendly chat than an official social interaction. Mr Mourad is willing to help with anything, you can get any useful information you need. Honestly I have never met such a warm, professional and friendly approach at the hotel reception like here. If you need to leave later than reported official check out time, you can leave your luggage in the hotel and before pick up you can use fully equipped toilet to refresh yourself. The same applies for early check in, luggage may be left in the hotel, you are offered a complimentary drink and get ready to explore neighbourhood until your room is ready. I will definitely come back here again . All the best, regards to Paris.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:16:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
