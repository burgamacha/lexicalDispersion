Great quite differently decorated and furnished hotel. Location good, Southwark Bridge Road is relatively quiet, but still easily accessible. (TUBE London Bridge 10mins walk, excellent bus RV1 2 mins away). Easy to walk to South Bank, Waterloo, Borough Market, London Bridge, shard etc.\nRooms quite small, but perfectly adequate and well furnished. Seemingly quite a new or recently refurbished hotel. Nice basic continental breakfast included in price. There is a car park, but charges eye watering.\nWell recommend this hotel, great location. Very close to all of central London, but just far enough out to be a tad quieter.\nRoom Tip: Quieter on car park side. We had Road side and still didn't hear a thing all night!.
