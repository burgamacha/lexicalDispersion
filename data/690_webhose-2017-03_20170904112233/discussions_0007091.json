This time was for pleasure with the wife and kids and needed more room than usual (NY hotel rooms are smaller than average).\nThe Marriott East Side was great. Ideal location for a December family trip (near Rockafeller Center for the Rockettes, tree, skating). The room was clean, the service was very good and the concierge was helpful. Great views too!\nOnly one minor issue - our toilet backed up twice, but staff responded quickly, so no big deal!\nI would stay again with the family!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:30:11.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
