The room I stayed in was small (standard by Paris standards) however beautifully fitted out. There is a small lounge downstairs where they serve breakfast or you can sit and relax. The location is a short stroll to to Boulevarde Saint Germain and right near the Garden du Luxembourg. A classy little hotel and definitely worth considering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:56:54.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
