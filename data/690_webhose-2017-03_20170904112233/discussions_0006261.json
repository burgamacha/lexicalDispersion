Our room had a beautiful view of the pound, hills, vineyards and mountains in the distance. The whole complex is very well maintained. the staff is friendly. Great breakfast. Good bar/restaurant for lazy evenings. I was especially surprised with their very large gin collection. The even have more than 40 South African gins available. And while you are there, do not forget the wine tasting. The estate makes same really nice wines (or you could try them in the bar/restaurant).\nThe location is just outside Stellenbosch, just a few minutes drive. Only points of criticism are: No two pin plugs in the room. One had to ask reception to get an adapter (with deposit). I thought the bar could stay open a bit longer (it closes at 4 pm, while most people leave around 5 pm).\nRoom Tip: Get a room with a view of the vineyards / mountains See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:43:07.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
