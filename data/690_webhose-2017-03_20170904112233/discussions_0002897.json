I knew the area and was not disappointed by the proximity to the 96th St. subway station -- literally across the street. The price was amazing but it was early March so the timing may have affected that. My room was on the 9th floor. The wi fi was excellent, super fast and I was able to stream video without any problem. The room was small but adequate. Tub and shower combination, refrigerator and microwave were an added bonus. I took a red eye from the west coast and luckily was able to check in at 9 a.m. and sleep for a few hours. I was pleasantly surprised because I didn't think a room would be ready. For those inclined, there is a kosher supermarket down the street and another around the corner on Amsterdam Ave., also several kosher eateries in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:36:20.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
