Jacques and his team made sure that we felt looked after and our every need was met. Every one who served us was courteous, friendly and efficient. It's in a beautiful location behind Brompton Road, close to Harrrods and the Aquila spa, where I enjoyed a relaxing swim thanks to the day pass which the hotel gave me. We had a nice full breakfast served in our room and the facilities in the room were great. The room has a very classic feel, which may not appeal to everyone, but it was impeccably clean, comfortable and felt very grand! The bar downstairs felt very homely and Esley in the bar looked after us and the other guests, who were also happy and friendly, with all the warmth of your favourite uncle. We had already read a lot about his Martini's - and they certainly pack a punch! Well worth a try. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would reccomend to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:37:42.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
