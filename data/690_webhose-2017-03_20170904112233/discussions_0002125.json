The rooms are spacious with great bathrooms and a separate dining/living area which my friend is able to stay on the sofa bed. I just wouldn't be able to recommend any of the hotels I've stayed at, and they were excellent as much as the Kimberley. Once you find the perfect mix why bother looking elsewhere!\nRoom Tip: Love the luxury one bedroom suite with the double sinks, perfect for friends.
