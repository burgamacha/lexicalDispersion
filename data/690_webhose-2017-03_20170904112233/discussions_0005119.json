Quick check-in, amazing boutique hotel, comfy & stylish reception area, room much bigger than expected, bed so comfy, TV had BBC world news, mini-bar if required, easy to use safe, bathroom spotless, great shower, breakfast could be better by adding nicer hot food, but great if you just want a coffee and small croissant, the breakfast manager was incredibly friendly and made you feel welcome. I would say that for the price paid overall for our stay we felt completely satisfied even a tad delighted and would definitely recommend to others. The hotel is located in quite a lively area plenty of restaurants, cinemas, great for exploring, metro & other travel links on doorstep, a lovely food market on Wed/Sat nearby, best of all for us was the Montparnasse Tower just across the road, the observation deck had such amazing views of the whole city 360 degrees, we got engaged at the top, a perfect moment. I hope this was the first of many trips to Paris, loved it.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors would be best for views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:27:29.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
