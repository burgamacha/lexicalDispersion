If you look out for a good special it is great value for money.\nBreakfast where a buff and is absolutely great the chef on duty is really friendly and clearly a guy that have been around the blok, handles the customer superbly if it gets busy and hectic. The lunch we had was also a nice steak well priced and prepared and presented homemade like. I have experience with the. Dinner that the food we ordered where a bit dull and did not have enough flavor.\nThe waiter is fairly new or just inexperience, to my liking i have waited to long if i order something at the bar but again they where buzzing with other customer. I got the feeling both time i where there that spier don't really cater for us that is from SA it is a very Africa vibe but still classy other than this i really enjoy the restaurant and my stay at the Hotel!
