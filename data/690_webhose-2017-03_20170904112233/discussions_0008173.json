It is great to get lovely cool water on your return to the hotel in reception after a day tramping around the city!\nThe rooms are clean, well organised and comfortable. WE didn't eat any breakfast at the hotel or use any facilities really, so can't comment on those.\nThe hotel is a bit of a walk from Times Square, but nothing unmanageable. I would stay again and certainly recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:29:09.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
