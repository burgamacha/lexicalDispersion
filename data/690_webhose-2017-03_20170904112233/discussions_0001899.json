From the moment we arrived the level of service we received was first class.\nOur 9th floor room had a large balcony which offered breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower. For being in the center of Paris, the room was great size. The hotel is located perfectly for all public transport and local amenities.\nWe had our breakfast brought to the room each morning and ordered room service for dinner which was of a great standard. Would recommend the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel and if returning to Paris would stay here again.\nRoom Tip: For best views ask for a higher floor See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:59:17.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
