Once we walked in to our room there was a personal letter welcoming us to the hotel with chocolate as well as coloring books for the kids. That night we left to an event and the front desk asked if we are enjoying are stay and if we needed anything to please let them know. There is nothing I love more then a hotel that genuinely wants to make sure you are having a great stay and The Iroquois Hotel definitely did that. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because we ordered room service for breakfast and when it finally came the food was cold but it could have just been a busy morning so make sure you get an estimate of time before you decide to order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:05:10.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
