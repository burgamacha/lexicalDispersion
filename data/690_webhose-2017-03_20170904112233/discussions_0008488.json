The lovely lady at the front desk was so welcoming and helpful. We booked this hotel online and arrived within 30 minutes of booking it. Our room was clean and comfortable. Given the shocking day we had it was so lovely to have her call our room within 20 minutes to check everything was ok and the we had everything we needed. There were several lovely restaurants close. They were also very helpful with maps and holding our bags for us the next day until our train departed. Lyric Hotel stay definitely turned our Paris visit into a success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:40:44.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
