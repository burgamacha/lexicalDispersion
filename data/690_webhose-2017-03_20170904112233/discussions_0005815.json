The suite was great for someone not wanting to spend $$$ on eating out, as it provided a kitchen (with full size fridge, stove top, microwave & dishwasher, plus utensils/crockery/cutlery). Although not large, the suite nevertheless managed to fit a comfortable king bed, a sofa, and the kitchen. My only gripe was with the bathroom: it had one of those no-lip showers so I had to wipe the floor dry every day. (Although I had been assigned an ADA bathroom so understood why my bathroom was like this, when I asked if I could be moved to a room with a SENSIBLE shower I was told all the bathrooms had this must-have-been-designed-by-a-man-who-has-a-wifey-do-all-the-cleaning type of showers. Hence I didn't bother moving.) The other problem with the bathroom was that there was absolutely NO counter space, so toiletry/makeup bags had to sit on the floor. The hotel provides complimentary breakfasts, and there was a great choice: pastries/breads, hot and cold cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit and a selection of at least 3 hot items. The hotel is situated in the garment district, so it's easy walking to Penn Station, Times Square, Broadway, etc (and the Javits. Not that I walked there, as it was FREEZING!). The hotel itself seems relatively new. The lobby area is appealing, and the reception staff were attentive and friendly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for both its comforts and the bonus of that kitchen!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:22:37.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
