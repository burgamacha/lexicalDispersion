It's outside of San Francisco and very quiet and clean. My room was great and very clean. They have a kitchen with a mid-size fridge, full-size microwave, dishwasher, cabinets and even plates and utensils. The stovetop is a plus for me because I work out of town a lot and get tired of eating out, I'd rather cook a meal and enjoy it. The price is great for what you get and the free hot breakfast is a plus as well.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:51:57.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
