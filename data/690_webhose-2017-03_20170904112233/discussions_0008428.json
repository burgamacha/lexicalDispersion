We arrived at London Bridge main line and followed the walking instructions from their web site. Perfect and spot on directions and took us about 10/15 minutes with luggage.\nCheck in was very quick, typed in our surname into the machine and our cards were printed.\nRoom was clean with coffee and tea making facilities. There is no safe.\nThe first night was so hot in the room, we had problems sleeping. We reported this and the second night it was cooler, but still very warm. The corridors were like an oven too.\nLocation wise there are loads of places to eat and drink all within a few minutes walk so we did not eat in their restaurant.\nCheck out was speedy and they let us store our cases for a few hours with a donation to a charity.\nWill definitely return and would recommend, as long as they sort out the room and corridor temperatures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:38:30.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
