Our room was exactly like the picture. New Year's Eve ball and everything. Sq. Ft.wise was a small room, but wasn't expecting a suite. Next door was the Theater. Didn't even have too walk outside. A Block and a half from Time Square. Plenty of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Other than from the airport, never used a taxi. Visited Radio City Music Hall , area around Rockefeller Center,and Time Square. Hector at the front desk was great. Walked to the next door hotel(inside no coats) to a restaurant. Cocktail hour and free continental breakfast. Thanks for a great economical stay, and great location.\nRoom Tip: Great place to stay if going to Broadway.
