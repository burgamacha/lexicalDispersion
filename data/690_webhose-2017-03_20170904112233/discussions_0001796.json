We used to have the breakfast in the restaurant, simple but enough (eggs, croissant, cereal, juices and few others).\nThe room very clean and gets cleaned regularly. We took the Duplex Room on the second floor but the view was towards the courtyard, so nothing to see. if we wanted a better view we had to pay extra.\nThe Duplex Room was with two levels were the lower level was the bedroom and a toilet. In the upper level you can find the bathtub, shower and additional toilet.\nThe thing that I don't know if it is a must or a luxury is water. They don't provide complimentary water and you have to pay for it. I am not sure if you can drink the tap water (I forgot to ask). I loved the idea when they provided a small box of chocolate in heart shape on Valentineâ€™s Day.\nOverall it was a great stay and recommended for all.\nRoom Tip: Rooms towards the courtyard doesn't have a view at all See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:46:31.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
