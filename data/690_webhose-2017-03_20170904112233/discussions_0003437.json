Our friends had recommended to us but I wasn't so sure what we would get for the great price we booked it for. Pleased to say this hotel was wonderful and very close to all the action from Times Square without quite as much hustle and bustle immediately after stepping out your front door. Room was clean and that means A LOT to me as I can be quite harsh when it comes to scrutinizing hotel room cleanliness. Staff at the desk were always very friendly and check in and check out was very efficient. I would consider staying here again if I return to New York in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:29:12.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
