On arrival it was pleasant very clean and tidy and staff pleasant. We were on the 7th floor which was nice as the Eiffel Tower at night when it lights up can be seen in the distance from the room. The only slight negative (which I'm not sure you would get at the back of the hotel) is the noise from the outside -- if your a light sleeper like myself request a room to the back of the building. The breakfast could probably have been found cheaper out and about however for ease we did eat here twice and it was enjoyed on both occasions - lots of choice. I would definitely recommend doing the Eiffel Tower, we booked onto the 5pm tour which was perfect as we seen it in daylight - then was going up to the summit and then up there for sunset which was chilly (wrap up) but so lovely! Obviously plan this depending on sunset at the time of the year your going if this is something you fancy.\nI would recommend Disneyland too, from this hotel it does take around 40 minutes over one metro and a train but so worth it and the fireworks display at the end of the day was just fantastic. Genuinely enjoyable for both children and adults! We visited PSG ground (to please the other half!) champs Elysee, sacre cour, notre dam and it was all worth a visit.\nOverall Paris was thoroughly enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone.\nIf you have any questions please ask ☺️", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:38.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
