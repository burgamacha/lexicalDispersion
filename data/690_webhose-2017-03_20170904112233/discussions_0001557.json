On Your Feet, the Musical, dinner at Tony DiNapoli's and a one night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel. It was better than we could even imagine. From our greeting at the front door to our Goodbye at the font door and everything in between. Excellent service, outstanding room, first class amenities. Could not ask for more. Even showed up at 10am looking to just drop our bags to find out our room was ready and we could check in and change for our day in the City. The room? Outstanding shower, turndown service, bathrobes, WiFi, and on and on. Highly recommend. Oh yea, we will be back next year.\nRoom Tip: The music they turned on during the turn down service was a nice touch.
