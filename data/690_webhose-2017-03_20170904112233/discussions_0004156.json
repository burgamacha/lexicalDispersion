The location was great for me - only 5-6 blocks from my office near Grand Central - but it really works for just about anyone. It's close to midtown attractions and the subway/regional trains, so very easy to stay here and see the city and surrounding area. I think that's reflected in the rate, but it's early spring in NY. You're going to pay a lot for any decent hotel room.\nThe hotel seemed nice and clean, and my room on the fifth floor, facing the rear, was quiet enough as far as street noise. BUT the floors are somewhat small, and even though I was as far as possible from the elevator, it wasn't that far. And the noise from people going in and out of their rooms was a little louder than normal.\nBeyond that, the room had a comfortable king bed and a little extra floor space that a typical mid-range Manhattan hotel. While I didn't take advantage, the breakfast seemed solid - similar to Springhill Suites in other cities. In all, a perfectly nice option in a good location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:59:54.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
