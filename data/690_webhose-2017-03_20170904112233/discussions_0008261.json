Our unit was very quiet & clean. Citadines provides everything one needs for an extended stay. We appreciate the small kitchen in the units to prepare breakfasts. We had been on a very hectic month long tour in South Africa which involved restaurant meals the entire time so appreciated the ability to relax & have breakfast in our unit. These units are practical & comfortable but not luxury units so if you are in need of room service or want daily room servicing without extra costs, you might need to look elsewhere. We have stayed in Citadines in other locations and are very happy with them & would highly recommend to like minded travellers.\nRoom Tip: The had a unit on the 8th floor & it was very quiet. The tubs are very slippery so be careful! See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:12:25.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
