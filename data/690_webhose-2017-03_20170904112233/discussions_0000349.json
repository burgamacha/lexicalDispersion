If you are looking for something within easy walking distance of the Coliseum, Trevi Foiuntain and Pantheon that will not break your budget then I would recommend this hotel. The hotel is situated within 10 minutes walking from Termini, just off the via Cavour. There are some excellent places to eat nearby. The room had what you expected, a bed, wardrobe and shower. We went in February and had glorious weather, in the 20s each day. This did cause the only issue we had which was at night the room was too hot, the noise from cars on the cobbles can be quite loud but this is the case for most places in Rome. Unfortunately there seems to be a law, according to the hotel, which forbids the use of Air Con in the winter months, it made no sense to me, so make of it what you will. The staff other than the air con were polite, there is a small shop next door to get essentials", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:23:17.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
