We had two family rooms. They were cozy, but perfect for our needs. Despite not being able to guarantee early check-in our rooms were ready. So wonderful after an overnight flight from the States. The location was perfect. A quick walk from Waterloo station and equally close to the London Eye and Westminster. The hop on hop off Bus tours also stop nearby. The rooms were wonderful for the price-which was very reasonable for this locale in London. Breakfast was delicious and the staff was very kind and courteous. If ever in London again we will stay here and will recommend to family and friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:58:28.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
