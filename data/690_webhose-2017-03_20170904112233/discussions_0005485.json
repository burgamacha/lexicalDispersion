Went to celebrate my daughters 15th birthday and we arrived at the hotel late in the evening and found a beautiful cake in the room. The gym is quite small and can get crowded easily, but the facilities are good. The pool is a must , with an amazing view over Paris . The breakfast is very good . The room was great and the toilets very good too. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they will do everything possible to help you organize everything you want. I will return with my little babies as I realized the hotel is very family friendly. Loved it!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:47:01.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
