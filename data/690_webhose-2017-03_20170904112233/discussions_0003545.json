The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location. There are so many restaurants and shops to visit within walking distance. Tour bus stops are just a few blocks walk as well. The arch and Eiffel Tower are visible within a short walking distance. The staff at the hotel gave good restaurant recommendations and were very friendly. Just down the street is a market with sandwiches, pastries, groceries, and items you might find at your local Walgreens in the U.S. The only thing I wasn't excited about was the size of the room. So tiny! But we spent so little time in the room it really didn't matter. The bed was comfortable. Can't wait to go back!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:48:52.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
