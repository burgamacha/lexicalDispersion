After a recommendation from a friend, some independent research and price comparisons, I decided that Pod 39 was the way to go. I was not disappointed. The hotel is in an excellent location (Midtown, about 3 blocks from Grand Central), is safe and well-maintained and easy to locate. I felt very secure staying there.\nYes, the rooms are small. And when I say small, I mean \"Harry Potter cupboard under the stairs\" small. But, thanks to my research, I completely expected this. The name 'pod' kind of gives it away. I had a single room and there was just enough room for a twin bed, desk and shelving/hanging item. Because I stayed at Pod 39 there was also a small private bathroom (this option is not available in single rooms at the sister hotel Pod 51). However, despite the tiny-ness, there are a lot of space saving elements in the room like under-bed storage space, and a small TV attached to the wall etc. I found that by unpacking the needed clothes into the under-bed drawer or the small hanging compartment, I was able to pack my suitcase away easily and maximize the space. All of this wasn't really an issue for me though, because I spent very little time in my room outside of sleeping/showering etc.\nThe rooms and hotel in general are very simple and minimalistic but clean, modern and well-maintained. The staff were very friendly and helpful, although I mostly only spoke to them during check in/check out. But there was a concierge desk that I saw other people using and there were iPads on the wall in the lobby which i imagine could be used to print tickets/boarding passes etc. The free wi-fi was great, although it was slightly annoying that I had to re-enter the password every time i left the hotel and returned. But it was a minimal thing.\nAs mentioned, the location is excellent. It's less than 10 minutes walk to Grand Central where you can catch the subway. There's a 'shuttle' train that just runs back and forth between GC and Times Square which was useful when going to see a show in Times Square. I was able to get around the city really easily either on foot or using the subway, which was great for me being on a budget. There are lots of shops and restaurants around in midtown, including Salvation Taco, the bar/restaurant attached to Pod 39. They offer basic breakfast fare in the mornings but I didn't really take advantage of this. I did have drinks and food there one night with a friend and it was really good. There's also a lot of delis, diners, coffee shops, pizza shops etc, within a couple of minute's walk so you won't go hungry!\nOverall, it was exactly what I was looking for. As someone who often travels solo, I dread paying for the cost of two people when I'm staying in a hotel room by myself. Pod 39 gave an excellent budget-friendly option that didn't require me to stay in a hostel or out of the city and I very much appreciated that.\nRoom Tip: I stayed on the 5th floor which was fairly quiet and meant i never had to wait long for an elevator!
