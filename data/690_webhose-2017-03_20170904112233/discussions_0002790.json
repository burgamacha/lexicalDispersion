The room did not smell good, it had a mildew odor and (since I checked in late) I just lived with it. But I packed up and took my bags downstairs the next morning to request a new room. They didn't budge on making me wait for my new room until after 2 pm, but they did give me a nice room that smelled great and the rest of the trip was really delightful. The staff is super helpful and quite kind. I liked everyone that I met, both desk staff and cleaning.\nThe hotel is located very close to a metro stop and a nice walk from Place de la Republique. The breakfast is fine. The neighborhood is pretty hopping at night, so I think it might work better for a younger person (or at least young at heart) but overall I enjoyed my stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:50:10.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
