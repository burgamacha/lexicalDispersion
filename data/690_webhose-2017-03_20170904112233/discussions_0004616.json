The front desk was very accommodating and so pleasant to deal with. Our experience with the front desk just got better with our stay. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Chris! He was so knowledgeable of the area and johnny on the spot with suggestions and offers of help. Just a delight! The only reason this isn't a five star review is that we had issues with housekeeping. We thought by putting the sign that said how is a good time to clean, we'd have a clean room after leaving for four hours... we were wrong. But we were able to get clean towels and toiletries from the cart and really what more did we really need? Overall, I'd recommend this hotel and we will stay again the next time we come to NYC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:41:56.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
