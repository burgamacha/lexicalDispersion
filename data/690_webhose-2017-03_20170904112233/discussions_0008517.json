But the rooms (with floor to ceiling windows) have stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and the rooms are clean, well appointed and well maintained\nThe bars and public areas are comfortable, fun and funky. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Be sure to try the pizza in the lobby snack bar....it is excellent.\nPrices are very reasonable and the location cannot be beat....it is one block to 5th Avenue. Highly recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: Go for a high floor above level 25 to get the view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:59:00.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
