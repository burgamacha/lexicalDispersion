The view from the Boro Hotel rooftop was spectacular especially on a night.\nThe hotel itself offers great value for money with clean rooms and adequate amenities. Simple check in process, breakfast available if required, coffee available in the foyer although no facilities for it in the room, no great hardship.\nAbsolutely loved the location of this hotel, a glimpse of New York life in Brooklyn.\nWould recommend the hotel for those on a budget.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors have the best city view.
