Our server was Sandor, an extremely polite and friendly member of staff, he took care to describe the sandwich fillings and the cake selection. He ensured we were kept topped up with teas and coffee. He was very smartly presented and is a credit to the Kensington Hotel. The decor is beautiful in the Kensington and this adds to a very relaxed atmosphere whilst enjoying a delicious afternoon tea. The cost is just Â£28, this is extremely reasonable for London. I can thoroughly recommend the Kensington Hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:54:48.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
