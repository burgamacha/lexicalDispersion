The hotel appears to be undergoing a renovation, and I had the benefit of a newly renovated room, which was small (in a New York way), but very well designed and clean.\nOnce upon a time, this would have been a bad location, but no more. The hotel is directly across from the back side of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It's on the bad side of Times Square, but the bad side of Times Square is quite tame compared to decades past. Times Square is maybe a five minute walk, and fifteen minutes gets you to most locations in Midtown. The new New York Times building is a half block away. I would have no issues putting my family in this hotel -- especially at a substantially reduced cost relative to properties on the other side of 7th Avenue. The location won't charm you, but you can get anywhere from here.\nThe property itself is nothing fancy. It's just a place to sleep, but it's clean, renovated, and the staff is friendly and greets you as you come and go.\nNegatives? The elevators go to all the floors, so if you end up on a local, you could have a lot of stops getting to your room. The bathrooms are small, so there is minimal room around the sink for your toiletries. But these are standard New York hotel room issues unless you go to a luxury property.\nThis may be my new go-to hotel when I'm looking to stay in Midtown on a budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:57:17.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
