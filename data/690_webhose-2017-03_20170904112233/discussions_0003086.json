The hotel is beautiful & full of character but the staff are what makes it . So pleasant and helpful . The rooms are small (like most hotels in rome) but Perfectly formed , absolutely everything you need , and the breakfast each morning was fantastic. Great choice of breads , buns , cereals , hot food etc . Also location is spot on!! can easily walk to ALL main attractions of but if preferred the Metro is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Top class would highly recommend ,\nRoom Tip: go for the larger double room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:46:05.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
