Check-in was a breeze. I arrived early and was able to check in early (I did call the hotel a week in advance to notify them of an early arrival), worked out great for me. The front desk staff was friendly. The hotel and room was clean. The bed was also cozy and the room smelled great! Great location close enough to walk to some attractions and restaurants.\nPlusses:\n*The calming tea that was placed out at night. It was relaxing and tasty.\n*The ping-pong table. I love ping pong so it's one of the reasons I actually chose the hotel. I was able to get in a good game before exploring the city.\n*Wellness themed. It just made me feel good!\nNo cons! I'd definitely come back and recommend this hotel. Location of the hotel was good, perhaps not super walking distance to a lot of attractions but Uber and Lyft came in handy. Close to a train stop.\nOverall this is a hotel I'll remember!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:41:37.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
