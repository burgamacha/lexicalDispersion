Bang on for The Trevi Fountain and walkable to the Pantheon and, a bit further, the Colosseum. The hotel is part of a small group owned by two brothers and the recent addition of Club rooms works well although quite a labyrinthian hike form the reception desk until you discover the Club zone has it's own street level entrance. Our Club room was almost perfect with a massive shower, loads of power points, free safe, large bed and a well stocked fridge (at - surprise - reasonable prices). Three things stopped a perfect score: polystyrene cups instead of china for the snazzy coffee machine, never quite learning which light switch operated which lights and an uncontrollable heating system; the temperature was fixed and couldn't be lowered.\nThe cafe (also owned by the hotel group) had pavement tables from where you could watch the never ending Chinese tour groups all plugged into the guiding commentary headsets and photographing anything and everything irrespective of it's artistic merit or historic value.\nBut, back to the hotel, and thoroughly recommended. With a wide breakfast choice, helpful staff, central location and good value for money this was well chosen by BA Holidays (we arranged our own Club room upgrade separately).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:43:15.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
