Used shuttle service twice but tram took you directly to Piazza Venezia. Comfortable shoes essential for all the walking!

Highly recommend if you are content to be about 20 minutes from the city as staff are very helpful and rooms extremely comfortable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:54:57.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
