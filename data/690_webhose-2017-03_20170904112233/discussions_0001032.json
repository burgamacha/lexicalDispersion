My flight is usually too early to eat breakfast in the hotel but I can grab coffee in the M lounge.\nGiven that the hotel shuttle ride is a scant 10 mins to be at the terminal to check hotel is now my airport hotel of choice.\nAlso if you do stay here consider eating at the amazing New England Lobster Market on Cowan Rd opposite the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:28:09.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
