The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean but small.\nThe location is good! Right next to the 9/11 memorial and close to a subway station (On Rector St), also a short walk to Wall Street.\nThe Subway is the best way to get around Manhattan! You can easily see most of the sights simply by riding the subway. You'll need to buy a MTS pass, which can be purchased at most subway entrances.\nI would definitely stay here again if the price was right!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:39:01.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
