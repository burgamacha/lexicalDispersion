The beds were comfortable enough. There was little noise insulation from the corridors and the cleaning staff were very noisy, you won't be getting a lie in past 8am. The cleaning also seemed erratic - sometimes they made the bed, other times not; they might replace the cups and coffee supplies or they might not. Strange. When we arrived in the room we had to call down to have someone come up and finish the cleaning job - we had dirty mugs and an unemptied bin. In terms of location, its out of the way from major tourist attractions and for a leisure break you'd do better to go further uptown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:54:49.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
