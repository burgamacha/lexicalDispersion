Novotel was stylish, chic, yet great for the kids and infant! Breakfast buffet is AMAZING and included with stay. Right on the River Seine and a good walk to the Eiffel Tower. Many cafes, restaurants and shops on the way. Very convenient to the trains. The rooms were a little small, but we weren't in there but to shower and sleep! Would love to stay again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:08:13.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
