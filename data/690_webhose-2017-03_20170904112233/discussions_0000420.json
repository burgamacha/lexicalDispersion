I've been writing reviews everywhere. Big spacious rooms nicely appointed with a nice desk to get your work done unless you were able to escape that chore.\nThe bed was ultra comfortable with big fluffy pillows that didn't fight my head so often a problem with hotel or motel pillows. I loved the shower because you literally could step into it. No need to swing your leg over the side of a tub to get into the shower.\nThe bar area was lovely with a congenial bartender who knew how to make a martini, you know, one with gin and dry vermouth. I ordered the Angus sliders (3 to an order) and they were delicious. Enough food that for me, I passed on dinner that night.\nIf you need to stay out by the airport or don't want to pay the hefty prices of staying in The City, this is the place to be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:12:08.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
