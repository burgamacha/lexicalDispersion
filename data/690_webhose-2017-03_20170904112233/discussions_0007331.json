Staff were very friendly and helpful....they provided us with a room upon an early arrival. Room itself was describe as 'small/cosy' but we found it plenty big and very comfortable, quiet, modern but with character. Good continental Breakfast was included in a very reasonable rate. Near metro and easy commute from airport. Shops, cafes, restaurants and entertainment on the doorstep. Two thumbs up for this little gem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:38:55.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
