This hotel was very minimalistic, smelt awesome every time you stepped into the foyer and it was a fantastic location to all the nightlife of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs! Also very close to the train station to allow moving around the city very easy.\nLoved the spacious bathroom and large bed. Downside for us that was no room to put our luggage. It obviously caters very well for people doing short stays with an overnight bag but for international travellers with medium suitcases! And I didn't even pick the smallest room.\nThe staff at the front desk were brilliant! Helped us with directions and recommending local cuisine. We visited the bar upstairs once and found it had a good atmosphere and quite busy. The only downside is our cocktails were served in plastic cups. Wasn't impressed.\nEither way, loved being in the Lowest East Side of Manhattan!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:44:15.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
