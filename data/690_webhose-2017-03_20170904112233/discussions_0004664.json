It was so close to metro which is a big plus to get around the city. The Front desk staff are super friendly and accommodating, especially Joel! It was not a luxury hotel, so you get what you paid for. Small and outdated rooms but very clean. Highly recommend for a budget trip. Thank you Pavillon Villers, we would definitely stay again the next time we come back to Paris :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:10:15.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
