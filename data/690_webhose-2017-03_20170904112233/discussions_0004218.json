I had forgotten in the hotel room fridge a very special box of gift chocolates from France for our New York friend.\nWhen we returned to fetch our luggage in the late afternoon, Mita and Kiara at the front desk could not have been more helpful. They tracked down the housekeeper Yuliya who then quickly found the lady who had turned the room (and whose name I am afraid I did not get) who had carefully put aside the box of chocolates which were then restored to me.\nProblem solved very quickly and with great friendliness. Many thanks.\nV van Blerk with F Proulx in room 707", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:25:59.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
