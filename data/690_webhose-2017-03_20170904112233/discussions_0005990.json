I found a charming boutique hotel with all the expected facilities, what I also found was a service team that really went the extra yards to make me feel welcome and to make every aspect of my stay a positive one. My room was lovely with rooftop views across to the Eifell Tower. Perfect room temperature and no traffic noise.\nGreat location right near the Arc de Triomphe but a much quieter street than the other nearby avenues. Short walk to the Champs and also the the airport shuttle to CDG Airport.really the best Paris can offer at an affordable price.\nRoom Tip: I loved my small rooftop terrace on the seventh floor, great views of the Eifell Tower.
