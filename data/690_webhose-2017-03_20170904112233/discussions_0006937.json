Metro station about 2 blocks...so you can easily access Manhattan or brooklyn...the room was big for manhattan...i stayed in the andaz suite...it was a pretty spacious corner room...with a decent view of the wall street area...weird thing, and its starting to become a trend at hyatts...is the shower has a glass see through door...not good if you're staying with friends...aside from that the room was awesome! nice amenities and free minibar goodies...as diamond/globalist you get breakfast in the restaurant, which was nothing special but the service was great...all in all this is a great hotel for the weekend especially with the lower weekend rates!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:01:58.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
