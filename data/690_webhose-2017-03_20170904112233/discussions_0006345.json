Rooms were decent sized for New York, very clean, equipped with coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator. Excellent location, 25 steps or so to multi-line Canal Street station, easy walk to Hudson River Park, Greenwich Village, neighborhood restaurants, shopping. I am a walker, so easily walked to High-Line, City Hall, Brooklyn (via the Brooklyn Bridge), Chinatown. Friendly, helpful staff. All of touristy New York was readily accessible, yet I enjoyed staying in a part of town where parents were taking kids to birthday parties and dance lessons, neighbors were running into neighbors on the street, and restaurant staff members were greeting customers by name.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:16:58.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
