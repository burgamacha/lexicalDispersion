I've found this one to be just about right, location-wise as well as price-wise, for a couple of days in this great city. The hotel compares well to a lot of other hotels in the same area (Bayswater -- just a short walk to the nearest Tube station) and price range (ordinary tourist hotel, no frills, no luxury, but safe and clean), and I've stayed here several times over the years. This time around, I had a particularly pleasant experience. I managed to leave my reading glasses behind when I left -- they had dropped to the floor and ended up under the bed, and I didn't discover that they were missing until the following day, by which time I was several hundred miles away. I realized what had happened, however, and when I came back to London a few days later, I stopped by the Phoenix to enquire after them -- though without much hope of getting them back. But there they were, still in their case, with a little note attached, presumably from the maid who had found them. So thank you, Athina, whoever you are! You made me very happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:12:54.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
