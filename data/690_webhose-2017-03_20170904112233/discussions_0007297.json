Great sized room and fantastic shower. Breakfast was lovely included typical English hot buffet and then selection of fruits, yogurt, juices and option of toast, tea and coffee. I ate in the restaurant the first night not a great selection of meals but food was to high standard. I preferred their sister hotel round the corner called the Grange Wellington.\nThe location is great less than a 10 minute walk from Victoria station!\nStaff were all friendly and check in was quick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:41:50.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
