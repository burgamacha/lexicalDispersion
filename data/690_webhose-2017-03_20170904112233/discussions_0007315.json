The hotel is very close to the Tower of London and to the underground station. The 15 bus goes direct to Trafalgar Square every few minutes. There is reasonably priced parking nearby in the Minories car park which is manned 24 hours. The hotel is modern, rooms are very clean, a good size, with large comfortable beds and well appointed bathrooms. All the staff we met were friendly, polite and very helpful. We had continental breakfast included in our rate and it was acceptable if not special although the fresh bread was very good. Highly recommended for you stay in London. Rates are very reasonable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:20:05.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
