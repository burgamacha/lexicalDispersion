It's brand new construction, so everything is immaculate. Room size compares well to a typical studio apartment in Manhattan. There is a mini kitchenette, which is perfect for saving a few dollars on meals. The hotel also has a roof deck with views of the Hudson, which would be amazing on a warm summer night. The free breakfast is decent, although the coffee was on the weaker side (but hey, it's free). Neighborhood may seem slightly gritty if you're visiting New York for the first time, but the area is completely safe, even late at night. All in all, I would highly recommend for anyone coming from out of town!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:19:40.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
