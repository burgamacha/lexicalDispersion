All the suites in this hotel are equipped with ample kitchen facilities (though oddly enough there's a vegetable peeler but not a corkscrew!), a clothes washer and iron and ironing board. With a Waitrose and Tesco within easy walking distance, you can save money by having several meals in the suite if you wish. That said, a full continental breakfast is also available for a reasonable cost either downstairs or -- for a touch extra -- delivered to your room.\nThe decor is modern and up-to-date -- the spacious bathrooms in particular with a heated towel bar seem newly renovated. My only real concern was the leaky double hung window that failed to shut completely (the room was chilly at night) and the pillows were rather hard. The staff were in general quite friendly. Overall, I felt it was a really good deal for the money in what is one of the loveliest parts of town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:42:51.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
