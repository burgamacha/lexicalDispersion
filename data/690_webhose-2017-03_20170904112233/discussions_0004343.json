Decorated in a New Orleans style, it's attached to the Bourbon Bar and Grill on West 46th St, also known as Restaurant Row. The room was spacious and spotless, particularly the bathroom, which had a walk-in shower. The staff were all helpful and polite to a fault. The breakfast was a basic continental breakfast, so if you want something cooked, you would have to go elsewhere. We generally couldn't fault the place though and would highly recommend these apartments.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room that's not directly above the bar.
