We and two other couples booked and were charmed by the hotel and especially the staff. The concierge worked very hard to persuade a stylist at the next door salon to come in on Sunday afternoon to style the three women for a night reception at The Louvre. Even when we arose late for breakfast, we always enjoyed fresh croissants, even if it meant a trip to the bakery for another pain au chocolat. The location is great with easy access to the metro, the Seine, and lots of sights - Eiffel Tower at night is 5 minutes walk! The local bistros are delicious. We will be back when we return to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:45:37.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
