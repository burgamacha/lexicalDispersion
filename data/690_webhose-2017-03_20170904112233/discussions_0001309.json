The staff were all friendly and very helpful. We stayed in the family suite and it was fantastic!!! So much space for our family of four for such an excellent price. The suite was beautifully appointed, warm and more than we could have ever hoped for in Paris. It is nice and close to both of the major train stations on this side of the city and within a block or two you'll find the metro stop, the hop on hop off bus stop, banks and lots of family friendly restaurants. A perfect base to explore an exciting city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:27:30.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
