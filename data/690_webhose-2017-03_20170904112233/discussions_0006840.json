The reception staff are bright, genteel and accommodating. I found them very willing and able to phone in my dinner reservations, store my luggage, and answer all sorts of questions about Paris. Khalid and Paula were particularly gracious and helpful, which really enhanced my experience of the hotel and the city. The room itself was attractive, quiet and comfortable, recently renovated and with adequate storage space, a safe and a good-sized TV. The bathroom was well-designed, with a strong shower, large sink, decent amenities and good mirrors. Excellent maid service kept everything spotless. The DIY breakfast buffet was average (I missed French cheese!) but included a cool device for quickly boiling eggs. Altogether a good deal, good location, good experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:00:34.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
