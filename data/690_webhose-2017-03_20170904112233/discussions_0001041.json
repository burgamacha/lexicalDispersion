Wr booked the Hotel Artemide after reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor. The Hotel Atryude did not disappoint!\nOur suite on the second floor was very spacious overlooking the Via Nazionale.\nThe complimentary mini bar was stocked with juice, wine, and beer which was refilled daily.\nBreakfast was included and had a good selection of breakfast choices, meats, and cheeses,\nWe were able to walk to the Trevi Fountain, Roman Forum, and Spanish Steps.\nThere is. Subway stop (Repubblica) two blocks up which we used to go to the Collesium and Vatican.\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Artemide and would recommend it if your looking for a great hotel in Rome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:17:11.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
