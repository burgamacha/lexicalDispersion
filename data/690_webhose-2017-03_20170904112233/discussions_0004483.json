It's far enough away from the congested centre, but a quick ride downtown. The staff at this hotel were very helpful. Actually, the visit did not start out so well. We stayed in a room above the bistro (105) and were disturbed by the shuffle of tables at close, and in the (very) early morning. We pointed this out to the hosts, and the front desk manager Chlo√© upgraded us to a suite on a higher floor. This was a very comfortable space, ample and quiet. Breakfast was great, with fresh baked goods from the local bakery. There are too many to count restaurants within walking distance along the canal, and the hotel sports its very own which was actually the best meal we had on our visit.\nRoom Tip: I will avoid the rooms above the restaurant next time.
