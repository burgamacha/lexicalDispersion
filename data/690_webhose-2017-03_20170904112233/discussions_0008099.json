However, the Radisson Kensington is a world apart from the Radisson Warren Street. Admittedly we stayed in a suite rather than a family room, but the staff make the difference here. From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't do enough to help. We arrived separately as I was already in London, and the staff phoned the room when my wife and kids had arrived. We ate in the restaurant on the first night, and whilst the menu is limited the food is good. The staff are very attentive, taking the orders directly from the children and making them feel as important as everyone else, especially when my four year old son asked the waiter whether the burger was better than the fish. Breakfast is buffet style, but with plenty of options from cereal to sausages and everything in between. The only downside to this hotel is the parking. They have valet parking, but they use a commercial car park, which charges Â£52 for 24 hours. If you remove your car during that time, you are charged again. Surely, a company the size of Radisson can negotiate a better deal for their customers. At the very least unlimited in and out during the 24 hour period. The staff though, make this hotel each of them addressing us by name and going out of their way to help, including walking to the car park to fetch coats from our car when my wife was cold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:39:29.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
