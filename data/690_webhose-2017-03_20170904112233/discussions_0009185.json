Less than $300/night including all tax and fees. Includes WiFi and reception with wine and heavy snacks 5-7pm. The snacks can serve as dinner if you eat a heavy lunch. Location is great, next door to Plaza hotel. Subway station 50 yards away that goes from central park south to Broadway, 42 street, SOHO, World Trade Center, ground zero. Best secret bargain in the city. We spent 5 days and the staff was great. No complaints. We stayed in a recently remodeled room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:16:41.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
