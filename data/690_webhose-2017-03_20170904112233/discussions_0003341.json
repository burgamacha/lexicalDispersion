I prefered to stay here itself..\nMy reservation was well handled and I was given a good room.\nGood air conditioning and 24 hours hot water, which some time not available in all hotels in Uganda...\nBed comfort is good. Bed sheets are changed everyday!!!\nThe staff is very helpful and every one looked after us their own guest..\nThe hotel is clean and staff are very friendly and helpful. The Ruby restaurant at basement provides excellent breakfast, lunch dinner almost round the clock. Room service is fast and efficient.\nAmazing hospitality.\nPlenty of car park space available. The hotel is easily accessible by Taxi or by Boda.\nThere is a well stocked supermarket at the ground floor, which is also a part of this hotel. You will get most of your daily needs here.\nJust one minor setback during my visit was, the hotel entrance is locked after midnight and there is no one is easily spotted to call and open the gates....otherwise this hotel I think is one of the best I stayed....\nDefinitely recommend this hotel...\nRoom Tip: take a room just off Kira road..
