Spacious rooms, offset from the main road so we were able to leave the window open to let some air in without being disrupted by the traffic on the Cromwell Road. 7/10minute walk from Gloucester Road tube station. I was disappointed with the breakfast, not a fan of continental breakfast but felt it was quite a limited selection for a 4* hotel but then again it is London so you get less for your money. The breakfast room was also slightly dated. That being said the room more than compensated. The bed was extremely comfortable, curtains had a blackout layer, sky box, tea/coffee facilities and a safe. The shower was powerful enough over the bath so you had the choice with a selection of toiletries for your own comfort. If I was to visit London overnight in the future I would consider staying here on a room only basis.\nLift did breakdown during our stay which wasn't ideal after a day of walking we didn't want to then walk up several flights of stairs to our rooms. Also as breakfast room in basement level it meant a 5 flight walk back to the room. However this was fixed in just over 24hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:11:02.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
