A little further from Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triumph so although we managed to walk it, we wished we hadn't by the end! Despite being very central, you couldn't hear any noise through the excellent double glazing.\nThe bedroom was quite compact but very comfortable. We felt the hotel and room was slightly dated but equally very clean, tidy and characterful. The bathroom was modern however with bath and shower over. Very powerful & hot shower!\nAll in all, a good hotel and excellent location for the price! Very pleased!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:44:33.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
