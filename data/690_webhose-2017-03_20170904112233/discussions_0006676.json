Alin was very friendly and helpful at check-in; as I arrived early in the morning and my room was not ready, he gave great suggestions where to have breakfast and he arranged a larger room for me when I returned. My room was comfortable, large, and quiet; very good for sleeping. The hotel has a wonderful breakfast and the meeting rooms were quiet, well-lit and well stocked. Also a well-stocked lobby bar. I would stay here again for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:43:42.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
