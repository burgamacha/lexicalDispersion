Room well big clean just i dont like the open toilet although i can close the sliding doors but it is troublesome and leaked out lights when i sleep. The breakfast i like it and just service needs some improvement, like they asked me tea or coffee one day but the coffee didnt come. The second time they took all my spoon, knife and fork, coffee and juice away when i gone out to pick corn flakes, i asked for replacement one and they brought back everything except the spoon i only need.
