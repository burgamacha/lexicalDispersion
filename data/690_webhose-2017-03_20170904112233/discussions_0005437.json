It took us a long, long time to find a hotel which worked for us but we love this place. It is small enough to be friendly, whilst providing a high standard of accommodation and service and is in a wonderful location on the corner of the Place Vendome and the rue St Honore. Almost all the key central Paris sites are within walking distance. The best feature of the hotel, however, is its staff. We are always welcomed with a big smile and a friendly catch up chat (despite our feeble school standard French!).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:36:20.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
