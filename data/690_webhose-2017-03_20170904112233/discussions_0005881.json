A nice modern bathroom with a big shower.\nLocation was very good especially if one wants to travel with the metro as its only five minutes away. Also away from the very touristic areas.\nIf I can complain about something is that from the room all the noise of the street is heard, especially the traffic which keeps going till the early hours.\nThe breakfast is served in the restaurant beneath the hotel. Good choice of food.\nAll the staff were very helpful, one night our baby was very sick and they immediately got us clean sheets and explained how to get to a pharmacy close by.\nIf we visit Rome again will definitely stay here.\nThanks hotel Dharma for a lovely stay!\nI definitely recommend", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:44:15.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
