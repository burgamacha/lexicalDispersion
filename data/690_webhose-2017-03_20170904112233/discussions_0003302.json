We're holiday inn club members and so booked the Holiday Inn express in time square. The hotel rooms were very small but clean and updated. The breakfast was budget but it offers a big variety including many hot items. Most importantly was the great staff. Shout out to Sandra at the front desk. We were here during the blizzard of March 2017 and stuck in New York City for an extra day... The staff gave us a late check out and helped us find a close hotel to move to for the extra night. Really helpful staff!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:50:38.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
