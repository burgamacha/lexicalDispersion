Close to Tower, Tower Hill Tube and Trinity Square. Perfect for a city trip. Very nice and attentive staff. Spacious and well equipped room, comfortable bed, loved that bathroom had a tub and a walk-in-shower. Complimentary water, coffee, tea and cookies. In-room-breakfast was very good. Currently redecoration of ground floor, but it was no disturbance.\nWould stay again.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:04:30.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
