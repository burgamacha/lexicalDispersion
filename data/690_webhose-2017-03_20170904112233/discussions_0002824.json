The triple room was big enough, clean, everything looked new and modern. Bathroom with decent size, clean, with shower (not a bathtub). They provided a good cot for baby.\nBreakfast was ok, but No veggies. There were baguettes, bread, jam, boiled eggs, bananas and oranges, two types of cheese and some ham, yogurt, Cereals, milk and coffee; mini pancakes and muffins.\nThe location is perfect, within walking distance from Notre Dame Cathedral and The Seine or Pere Lachaise cemetery.\nA Careefour Supermarket is just around the corner.\nGood value for money.
