Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was a family room and for new York was a good size. There was a fridge, a safe, TV, ipod dock, hairdryer, iron and loads of freebies in the bathroom. The beds were very comfy and we had no noise issues. We asked for a room with a bath and that's what we got. All clean and tidy all round. The maids were friendly and accommodating. We had to stay an extra night due to a flight cancellation and the hotel helped us to stay an extra night in the same room. A great location just a couple of minutes walk from Times Square and 24 hour shops nearby. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:40.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
