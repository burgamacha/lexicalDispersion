We felt pampered as we enjoyed soft, comfy robes and fresh slippers at the end of each day. We relaxed as a friendly staff member turned down our bed and brought just what we needed…bottled water and chocolates! This hotel has an amazing staff of professionals that truly are focused on giving each guest an excellent experience. We communicated with Feras and Oscar before our arrival and everything was exactly as they promised. We recognized many of the staff members from our stay four years ago, and that speaks volumes about the professionalism and atmosphere of the hotel. I can’t tell you how many times we were asked by staff members if they could help us! Our rooms were very clean and well-kept and the housekeeping staff was very friendly and available to us. We looked forward to the breakfast buffet each morning. Don’t miss the egg frittata or French toast. The Hilton Times Square is a quiet oasis in the perfect location with entrances from two streets. We thoroughly enjoyed our week here, look forward to returning, and will recommend it to friends visiting NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:43:37.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
