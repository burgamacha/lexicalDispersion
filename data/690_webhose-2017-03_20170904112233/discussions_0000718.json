The Doubletree is located close to Downtown San Francisco and SFO, so getting around is quite easy (traffic permitting).\nCheck in was fast and the front desk staff very friendly. The lobby was spacious there were plenty of places to sit and wait for the complementary shuttle bus to SFO come the morning.\nOff of the lobby is the Double Tree's restaurant/lounge WhiteCaps Eats & Drinks. They have 8 craft draft beers available along with their hand crafted drinks. The \"eats\" portion is California cuisine inspired and unfortunately I was unable to try it since our group wanted to go to a resturant elsewhere in San Francisco.\nOur room was large and spacious. It had a little coffee nook a small refrigerator and a large screen TV. There was WiFi in room and like all the Double Trees that I have stayed at, the beds were comfy, the room and bathroom were very clean and also came with lots of towels and oh yes, the warm cookies upon arrival.\nSince this was an over night stay with an early morning flight out, I didn't really investigate the hotel for other amenities. I was told later by a friend that there was an indoor pool and a fitness center on site.\nAll things considered, I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:46:44.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
