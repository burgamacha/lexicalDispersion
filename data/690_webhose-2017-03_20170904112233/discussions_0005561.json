Hotel Hiberia is excellent, we will definitely return. Had a Fab Four nights here,the staff were great the room we had was plenty big enough and spotless and the buffet breakfast was plenty big enough to start you off for a full day of sightseeing. Excellent front of house team aswell and the young lad serving at the bar in the evening was a pleasure to speak to.\nRoom Tip: Room 101 is a low floor but you can hear the traffic.
