Here's the highlights -\nBooking - $20 extra for a higher floor? Nope, I usually get that by asking at check-in, it's in my guest profile and my hope was I'd get an \"upgrade\"\nCheck in- I was early and the front desk clerk said she would try and get me in early. Waited 20 minutes and went back to the desk and she had a room on 12. Not as high as I like, but no worries. I did have to ask about the property, facilities, any highlights, etc. and was disappointed that there wasn't any coffee, snacks, breakfast included. Often I just want a half a cup of coffee mid day or in the evening, but that's my fault, I'll know for next time.\nRoom- Spacious for the NY area and well appointed, I was very happy with the room, cleanliness, furnishings, etc. Comfortable bed is always a plus.\nOverall - this is a very good property for the money, I'd really like a room on a higher floor without paying a premium, a cup of coffee any time of day, and breakfast in the morning, but that's for other properties on 28th. Not sure I'd return unless I reach status with this chain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:04:09.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
