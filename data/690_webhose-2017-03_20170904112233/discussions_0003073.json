I'd recommend Bareburger nearby. Only 10-15 minute walk to Times Square.\nThe lobby and bars have a nice style to them. There's something intimate about them. Nice old wooden furnishings.\nAs far as the rooms, the size has been previously mention but it's not something that's going to be helped. What I was surprised at was the lack of any notes or information regarding the hotel. I expected information about check-outs or services in a pamphlet. Couldn't find anything. Also our air conditioning broke on the first day, we mentioned this to the front desk twice but it never actually got fixed. To their credit we complained on checkout about this and got a $50 credit at the bar.\nBar prices expensive but you won't find any cheaper in a New York hotel. As far as speaking to you it felt like the front desk people were well trained in service. I did find the room credit at the bar very confusing though, again if there was information in the room on a pamphlet it would have made it clearer. It felt like a lot of information on this hotel I had to find out from this very website.\nNot sure if I'd stay here again. Everything outside the rooms is nicely done, but I'd probably want a bigger room and no glass panel in the bathroom at my next stay in NY. If the rooms were improved I'd have no problems leaving 5 stars because the effort was there from the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:03:33.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
