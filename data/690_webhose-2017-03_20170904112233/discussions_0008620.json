Corridors to rooms were a little dark but all adds to the contemporary style of the hotel. Lovely bright room which had been beautifully decorated on Rose petals and prosecco left for us. We love covent garden and Leicester Square and this is perfectly situated with only a few mins walk to each. We've never stayed 5 star before so had no idea what to expect. Receptionist could have been a little more helpful on check in as was given a key and wished a lovely stay. We had to ask which way to go and where then told where the lifts were. We wernt told anything about the hotel and the restaurants, gym next door or the vip bar. There are no tea making facilities in the room which was a little disappointing after a long shopping spree and first thing in the morning.\nwe would stay again purely for where the hotel is situated but I do think it would have been nice if we had some info on the hotel and what was available at check in", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:21:53.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
