The Amba Hotel is right next door to Charing Cross station and with in easy walking distance to all west end theatres and attractions. We were going to see Kinky Boots which made it even more convenient, as both theatre and hotel are in the Strand. When we got to the hotel we were greeted warmly by the staff and were able to check into the room early, which we were very grateful for, as we were going to the afternoon show. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, with lovely d√©cor. The room we had was again spotless and very up to date. There were complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the fridge along with plenty of coffee and tea. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom good with a powerful shower. We had an evening meal in the restaurant, which was surprisingly un-crowded, however the food was excellent and service 10 out of 10. In the morning, we had booked to have breakfast which was just amazing. The amount of different choices was mind blowing. There is an full English buffet breakfast plus continental and such an array of cereals, fresh fruit and drinks that I can't list them all. Every thing about the Amba impressed me from the quality of all food and drink to the cleanliness of the whole hotel. A special mention to every member of staff we came into contact with, you were all so friendly and polite it made us feel very welcome. Thankyou", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:49:20.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
