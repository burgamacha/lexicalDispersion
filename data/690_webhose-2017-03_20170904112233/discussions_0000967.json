On arrival we were promptly placed in the rooms. The hotel interior and rooms are stylish and exquisite. I had a double room (№310) which I occupied one. The room is not very big but cozy and has everything you need - safe, dressing room, mini bar, TV, bathrobes, slippers and all toiletries. The bathroom was immaculately clean. The hotel floors are everywhere on carpets, so it is very quiet. I am a light sleeper but did not hear if someone in the next room is, so I conclude about the very good sound insulation.\nBreakfast (buffet) is served on the 1st floor, from 7.00 to 10.30. You are offered fresh juices, various cereals and muesli, pancakes, bacon and sausage, potato patties, salted salmon, ham, various cheeses, yogurt, croissants and rolls, jams, rice pudding . Everything is fresh and very tasty.\nThe hotel staff is very professional, friendly and always willing to help. The hotel cares about the high level of service after accommodation requested to complete the questionnaire and share your opinion. This is one of the best European hotels I have ever stay in. Highly recommend.\nRoom Tip: Room №310 is comfortable and quite.
