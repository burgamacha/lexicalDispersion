The hotel is a short walk from the metro station and well located for walking to restaurants, attractions and shops around the Left Bank.\nThe hotel is stylish and has been furnished and decorated with great care and attention to detail. Our room was great - a large comfortable bed, and a large and striking bathroom. Both looked perfectly presented and could have been in a design magazine. The bathroom had a generous supply of L'Occitane toiletries.\nWe didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but there are a number of cafes a short walk away.\nA special and charming place to stay in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:00:20.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
