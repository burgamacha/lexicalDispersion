I am sure the regular price is far higher. That's why I say I was lucky, though that does not detract from the quality of the product. I am usually suspicious of designations like executive room but this really was very fine. Large bed,, sitting area, sofa, desk. A particular touch of luxury was the use of the executive lounge. I would normally forgo that but I found that I could get a continental breakfast there in very civilised surroundings, quiet and uncrowded rather than the usual fracas in business hotels with every travelling salesman in town filling his plate with sausages at the company's expense.\nThere's always a but, and here it is. The bathroom was extremely small. I doubt there is a cat small enough to swing in it. Maybe a munchkin (I just looked that up). Even then, it's not only the size of the cat but the length of your arm for a decent swing. The bathroom was not only very very small but also full of sharp corners so you really do have to take very great care when turning round, stepping in and out of the shower etc not to brain yourself. That's some free advice for you. On the other hand if you are interested in small bathrooms (maybe you are a small bathroom designer) this si the place you want to be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:36:40.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
