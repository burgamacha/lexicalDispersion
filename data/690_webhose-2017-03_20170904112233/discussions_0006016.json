We were only having a small ceremony of no more than 25 guests & we were looking for somewhere simple with views & the Citizen M was perfect. While arranging this, the email communication back & forth was great! All questions & queries were answered efficiently. When we arrived we had a lovely little Congratulations card awaiting our arrival in our room. It was lovely.\non our wedding day, the staff were very accomidating & helpful in every possible way. nothing we asked was too much of an issue. We had a great experience with Citizen M & will definitely return in future!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:12:18.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
