All of the staff were caring and treat guests as if you are in their own home. My birthday was on one of the days that we were there and they sent me a bottle of Prosseco! What a wonderful surprise! Mauro was so helpful each evening in finding wonderful places to eat! If you speak to him about a place to eat ask him to write it for you as he does the most beautiful calligraphy! You will want to save it because it is so beautiful! The hotel was always spotlessly clean,comfortable and charming, too. Breakfast was delicious and even included scrambled eggs and bacon. We made an error with our reservations and had to move hotels and they even helped us find accommodations for our last night. Just can't say enough positive about this hotel! Wish I was still there!\nRoom Tip: rooms facing the square offer view of Pantheon See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:12:31.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
