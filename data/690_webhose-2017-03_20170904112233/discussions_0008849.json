Looks like an office block from the outside but is wonderful inside. Large spacious reception, contemporary dining/bar area and a lovely lounge.\nWe had a room on the 6th floor we were given an upgrade from a club to superior room. I'd hate to think how small club rooms are as the superior seemed a normal sized room, but then in London hotel rooms are invariable smaller. Shower room was very small but beautifully decorated. We had to leave a deposit of Â£50 on our card in case we used the mini bar but our mini bar was empty!\nThe hotel was in a good location as we were planning to eat in Brick Lane that night , the hotel road leads into Brick Lane so perfect.\nWe had the continenental breakfast. There was a large range of pastries, different breads, jams, cereals and lovely yoghurt.\nWe hope to come back next time we are in London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:45:59.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
