We wanted to go to Little Italy, Chinatown, the 911 museum, mid-Manhatten and it was great that there were 2 subway stops we could use.\nBreakfast had lots of options including hot and cold selections. Tea/coffee available all day.\nWe did pay more for a higher room thinking we would have a city view, but it was limited by the buildings across the street - so that wasn't worth it. Also, their was an ugly sofa in the room at the foot of the bed which was too big and unnecessary.\nStaff was very nice and helpful. Wifi was free since we are Hilton Honors members, otherwise there is a daily rate.\nRoom Tip: Don''t pay for a higher floor with a view, not worth it.
