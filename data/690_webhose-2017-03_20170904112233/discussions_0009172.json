After having been on a plane for over 25 hours and arriving at the hotel at 9:30am I was glad to check in and find out my room was ready for me and the staff were nothing short of amazing! I cant remember the lady at receptions name but she was wonderful and very friendly and the concierge Daniel was very helpful in helping me find my way to different areas of London to explore! I picked this hotel because of its location being Leicester Square as I planned to attend a premiere during the week and wanted to be close to it and I couldn't have picked a better hotel for that! I was also lucky enough for the hotel to get me tickets to the premiere which was amazing and made for the highlight of my trip! I stayed here for just over a week and I didn't want to go home and now i'm planning on coming back next February and I wouldn't stay anywhere else! Thanks again to all the Daniel and all the staff for an amazing stay in London I cant wait for next year now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:57:36.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
