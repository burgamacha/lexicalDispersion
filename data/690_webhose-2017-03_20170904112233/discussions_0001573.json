I was well looked-after from the time that I emerged from immigration at Charles de Gaulle and the driver that they sent to collect me was right there!! That is a service that they offer if you book directly through the hotel itself. I was greeted warmly at the reception and shown to my beautiful room with a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower. My room was spacious and comfortable with a balcony, and the bathroom was absolutely luxurious complete with a large waterfall shower. The appointments throughout the hotel are exquisitely designed, and it feels like you have come home each time you enter the hotel. Breakfast was perfect each morning with a large continental as well as American selection. In the evening, the restaurant, Nube is a unique and creative dining experience in Paris. The dishes are carefully prepared and incredibly delicious!! The lounge/bar area is cozy and beautiful as well, and is a welcome retreat after a long day. I feel that the location is absolutely perfect as well. Prestigious shops, such as Alaia and Celine, are interspersed amongst small shops and cafes that accommodate every taste level. Being there for Fashion Week, I found it easy to get to and from where I needed to be from that location, and the staff at Marignan was always helpful in answering questions if I needed to find something. I cannot say enough positive things about my stay at the Hotel Marignan. I found the entire staff to be genuinely kind and interested in making my visit the best ever in Paris. I can say definitively that I have been to Paris many, many times- but this was the best hotel experience I have ever had there.. I will be staying with them from here on out anytime my travels take me to Paris. It truly feels like an elegant home away from home! I already miss it!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:46:20.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
