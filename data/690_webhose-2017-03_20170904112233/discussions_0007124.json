Lovely gift of a bottle of wine as it is our honeymoon!\nRoom was on ground floor near to kitchen and patio area which meant that it was pretty noisy, so we didn't get much sleep on our first night - and you're woken up pretty early when people start moving around for breakfast. If we had been there any longer than two nights we would have asked to switch rooms. I'd recommend requesting not to stay in room 22 if you are a light sleeper!\nThe room was lovely, very clean and had a good sized bathroom.\nBreakfast was great, lots of lovely restaurants, bars and shops nearby. Speedy laundry service too!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:11:57.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
