This premise has lived up to the Group's standard. My room was clean and spacious, and I was lucky to have a little balcony where I enjoyed my morning coffee and evening drinks, with a Paris Ian skyline.\nThe location is perfect as:\n1. There are a few metro stations (Bregeut-Sabin, Chemin Vert, Bastille) just around the corners, where you can easy take a metro line without changing;\n2. Plenty of cafes, bistro and restaurants in the neighbourhood;\n3. It's just some 15 mins' walk to Le Marais, a chic shopping area, and within walking proximity to Notre Dame; you may also find lots of boutiques a few streets away in Saint Sebastian Froissart & Republique.\nWould definitely stay here again in my next visit to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:36:08.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
