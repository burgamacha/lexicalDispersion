The location is smack dab in the middle of Times Square; the entrance overlooks the iconic Times Square steps that rise above the TKTS kiosk. So, everything a tourist needs is right there. The room was what I normally expect from a Doubletree - clean and comfortable with a large bathroom. The check-in staff was courteous and acknowledged that if the storm turned really bad, they would reconsider later check-out times the next day. I had dinner in the lounge as the restaurant is not open at night; the french onion soup and chicken caesar salad were good. That evening the storm came in. The next day, the breakfast buffet was extended by an hour to accommodate the dozens of patrons who had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated. My guess is that some of their staff did not make it in. I overhead several people who ordered off the menu grumbling about how long it was taking to get their meal so I opted for the buffet, which had a decent variety of hot and cold breakfast foods with a wonderful addition of chicken dumplings available. So, the reason I'm only giving this hotel 4 stars is not because of the wait, but because the buffet was a whopping $33, about the same price as my whole dinner.\nRoom Tip: You can try for higher floors, but you will likely still hear all the city sounds at night.
