I have frequent biz trips to Paris every year for past 5 years, therefore I love to try different hotels. This one is definitely one of my favourite 2 so far!!\n10 mins to Segur metro station of metro 10. Located in a quiet and lovely residential area. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The bed is comfortable, the room size is moderate. The breakfast and its dining room is where I enjoy most!!\nAs I'm not a pure tourist type, I don't really need to get a place nearby many tourist spots in Paris. This hotel suits me very well.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:19:50.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
