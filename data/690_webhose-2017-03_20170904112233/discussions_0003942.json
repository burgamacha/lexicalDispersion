We booked a deluxe room (at wheat we thought was a rally good rate) and were pleasantly surprised at how big it was! Decent bed, big wardrobe, a desk and really good size bathroom. The hotel was in a great spot, near various subway stations, but also very quiet. The free breakfast in mama's cafe was an unexpected bonus and a great way to start the day. The staff were also polite and really helpful. Only downside for us was that there wasn't a bar in the hotel but that didn't really bother us on this trip because we were out so much. To anyone wondering whether to give Hotel Mulberry a shot, I would say 'yes, definitely'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:14:43.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
