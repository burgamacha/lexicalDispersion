There is also a choice of reasonable places to eat nearby.\nOur room was fine except there were no easy chairs, which restricts the level of comfort. The breakfast was good, with lots of choice and good coffee on tap.\nWe were able to check in a little early and also left our luggage in storage on our last day. That evening we ate in the Thyme restaurant, which wasn't bad at all and reasonably priced too.\nThere is no communal seating area but the hotel and restaurant are attached to a Costa coffee and we then chilled out there for an hour without a drink, with no pressure to move on.\nI did think the room was expensive compared to other Premier Inns but I guess that's down to the location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:27:55.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
