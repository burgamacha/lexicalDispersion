The hotel is really cool and funky, the white and neon pink lighting are unique. The rooms are big enough and are \"out there\" in terms of decor. We loved it there. There is a nice rooftop terrace ( a bit cold in December though). The only issues are the facilities. The bar isn't amazing and there isn't a restaurant which was a pain the first night. Breakfast is so so but ok if you just want something quick before heading out. We ate out most mornings in cafes although all were crazy expensive.\nI would go back, but it's a shame there isn't a better bar or restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:19:57.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
