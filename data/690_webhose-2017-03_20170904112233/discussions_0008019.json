We arrived late and were expected and welcomed. Our room was lovely, the furniture was comfortable and elegant, and the bathroom was clean and spacious. The Location is prefect - Hyde and Kensington Parks are a short walk away as is Paddington underground station and the neighborhood is beautiful. Nearby are a variety of very good restaurants. The staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfast is varied and delicious. We would definitely be happy to stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:46:25.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
