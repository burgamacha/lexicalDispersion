We had the same room (910), a junior suite, as the last time--which is most comfortable. Our room rate was $170 daily--a non refundable and special rate.The desk staff greeted us by name on our arrival. The RSH is a small hotel, and the staff treats you as family. The staff (especially Manny) went out of their way to make us feel at home. Its location at 47th and Lexington is convenient to all of the venues we frequent--taxis are easy to get--though we used Uber most of the time. Complimentary breakfast of fruit, yogurt and cereal is available 24 hours. The housekeeper (Carmen) was the same as our first visit and she keeps the room spotless. The bar is well stocked with an excellent bartender. When we had a question about the operation of the TV an engineer appeared in 5 minutes. The RSH is an outstanding value in all respects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:13:00.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
