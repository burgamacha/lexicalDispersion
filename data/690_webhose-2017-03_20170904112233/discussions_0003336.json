Brand new, clean, lovely hotel with wonderful staff. We felt like family by the time we left. Delicious breakfast, reasonably priced rooms service and a great bar. We loved this hotel and the entire staff. They were so nice to help us figure out where to go and what to see in Paris.\nRestaurants are within easy walking distance on the Canal St Martin. The metro is literally steps away down the street and a Laundromat is 4/5 doors down from the hotel. (The Laundromat is 7 Euros for a large load. You need to bring coins). Also, the Laundromat is a bar! There is a secret door in the Laundromat to a hidden bar. Can you find it? :-)\nRoom Tip: The beds were heavenly. Firm and not too soft which would have been very bad for my back.
