The owner spared no expense from the Reidel wine glasses at the bar to the extraordinary artwork placed in every corner of the common spaces. The service could not have been better every step of the way. We particularly enjoyed spending the evenings in George's bar and reading in the cozy lounge on the 18th floor overlooking the mall. A wonderful breakfast, afternoon tea with snacks and a glass of wine were all included in the daily rate. Highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:08:29.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
