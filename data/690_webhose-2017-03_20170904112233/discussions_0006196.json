We arrived early to drop bags off as it was too early to check in but we had tickets to see a show, the very friendly reception staff greeted us and arranged an earlier check in to a room that was ready. The room was clean, nicely laid out for 3 of us.\nThe location of the hotel was perfect, very close to the southwark underground station. Again the reception staff were very helpful when we asked how to walk to places rather than go by tube.\nWe returned to the hotel at about 10.30 and stopped for a drink in what was a very child friendly bar area. (This does not mean it was overrun by children, merely that it was light & welcoming).\nThere was a lot of choice for breakfast. And plenty of staff in hand to help. Checking out could not have been easier. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area and especially travelling with children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:49:16.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
