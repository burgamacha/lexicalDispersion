It was a nice spacious room and right across from the metro. You can see the hotel from the steps of the metro station and vice versa. Pleasant reception staff.\nOnly downside was that housekeeping knocked on the door even though we'd put the sign outside to say not to disturb us, but still came in!!! Same thing happened again the next day where we actually called out to say no thanks and they still came in\nThe lady didn't understand us and started doing some cleaning while we were still getting ready.\nMy sister and I were quite shocked at both of these experiences but just thought luckily we weren't a couple on a weekend together in Paris That could've been more than awkward. Otherwise a pleasant stay in a clean room with a good location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:03:53.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
