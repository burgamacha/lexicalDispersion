Not only did they let us check in way early, they upgraded our room for free! That was thanks to Mohammed at the front desk! Also, without me knowing, he pulled aside the manager, Star, and had her in on a whole plan for him to propose to me right there in the hotel! She let the next manager, Jackie I believe was her name, know the plans and it could not have worked out better! She even brought up wine and chocolates on the house so we can celebrate! The staff at this hotel were so sweet, and so accommodating, I can't thank them enough. They had a big hand in a night I'll never forget!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:05:16.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
