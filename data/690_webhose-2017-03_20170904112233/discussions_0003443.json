We had a twin room on the second floor (can't remember room number) but we used the lifts which were past the bar, not the ones in reception. This was our second visit to the hotel.\nThe room was comfortable and had a window which opened which was a blessing as it was quite mild and I prefer a cooler room, it was otherwise not uncomfortably hot. It also overlooked a courtyard which had tables and chairs presumably in use in the summer so not sure if it would be at all noisy then - it was very quiet at the beginning of March. Bathroom with separate loo and toiletries including shower cap etc (sometimes not available even in some expensive hotels). Breakfast buffet was very good and available from 7.30.\nLocation great as it was a 10/15 min walk to Arc de Triomphe and then a short walk down to the river. In fact we only used the Metro (just a couple of minutes away) on the second day there as it poured with rain otherwise could reach most places on foot. It also sits just off one of the large roundabouts with lots of restaurants/bars. There is a nice restaurant almost next door (also a Cyrillus).\nAll in all, a good place to stay with friendly and helpful staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:19.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
