The room itself was enormous for New York, plenty of room for me and my Girlfriend. The bed is possibly the biggest an comfiest I've ever stayed in, the kitchen was very well equipped and our used cups and glasses were put in the washing machine and clean for our return after a long day. The walk in wardrobe and large mirrors were a hit with Sophie! The room was clean, quiet comfy and a great base for a romantic weekend in New York. The location was great only a 1 minute walk to Wall Street Station and 5 minutes to Fulton Street. We would highly recommend the Bar The Bailey at the end Pine Street to sit at the bar and have 'pub snacks' and drinks as well as Leo's Bagels for the biggest breakfast bagel possibly in the world! There is a well stocked super market about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Some highlights and tips from us would be to watch the Sunset from Brooklyn Promenade, A romantic stroll around Central Park and early evening drinks at The Press Lounge which offers great views over Manhattan whilst sipping cocktails cozied up on a big comfy couch. This hotel is 10 out of 10 and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to visit NYC either on business or pleasure. Thanks Guys, Great Job!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:27:30.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
