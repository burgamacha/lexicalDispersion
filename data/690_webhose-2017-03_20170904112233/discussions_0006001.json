I've had great experiences with Mercures, and this did not disappoint.\nWe were given a corner room on the fourth floor; I was delighted that we had a balcony overlooking Rue de la Fayette, which also included a gorgeous view of the Sacre Coeur. It wasn't a large room, but it was just fine; the bed comfortable, the bathroom had a new toilet and shower even though the tile and sink were a little dated. I was slightly concerned it might be loud, but other than a few late night drunken revelers outside, it was absolutely fine.\nWe didn't have the breakfast at the hotel, as with any place in Paris, there were boulangeries right close by and absolutely delicious.\nThe staff was extremely pleasant, let me use franglais, and securely stored our luggage after check-out. Free wifi worked fine for our smartphones; there's an upgrade for if you want to stream netflix or something on laptops. And when we asked for a bucket of ice for champagne at 10pm, there was no judgement -- reception was happy to provide it, along with wine glasses!\nI look forward to staying here again, next Eurostar trip!\nRoom Tip: Great views from the balcony rooms See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:32:37.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
