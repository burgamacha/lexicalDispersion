That said it's a lovely clean and friendly environment. The staff are polite friendly and very efficient helping with all of our needs. In terms of location it's great. Very central with easy access to all of the sights. It's also situated on a very quiet street just off the main road and a city bike station is opposite. Make use of these they're great fun. I think the hotel has recently been refurbished as the decor in reception and the rooms is immaculate. We had a twin room overlooking a small courtyard. The room was immaculate if slightly small and the bathroom is brand new and clean. Coffee making facilities available and a free minibar with soft drinks. There is also a safe which is free to use. We didn't have breakfast but that looked well presented. An ideal hotel for exploring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:03:24.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
