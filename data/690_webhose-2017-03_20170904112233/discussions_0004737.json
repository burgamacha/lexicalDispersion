It is not a full-service hotel (no restaurant, bar, etc.) which was fine for us as we wanted to experience the restaurants, bars and attractions that were near the hotel. We had no problems with water or appliances or the Television although we only watched it in the morning for the weather and news. The kitchenette was great as we brought home leftovers and had our coffee in the room before going out all day. It worked for us and it is probably fine for most people. If you want a view pay $400 a night for a much smaller room. We were on the 32nd floor and never had a problem with the elevator.\nRoom Tip: We liked upper floor. View did not matter, we were not there much.
