We stayed there for 2 nights on 3/19 and the 20th. Once we got there which was early we were able to leave our luggage there and travel the city. We had the option of getting 1 room but we wanted to be on same floor. They called us within 2 hours and said our rooms were ready. All the staff there was super nice and friendly. RYAN is the man! He works the door and was always very helpful. I mean EVERYONE was awesome! We partied way late and the 3rd shift peeps were cool! The hotel itself is beautifully decorated. I literally have not a single complaint! If I ever go back the NYC I will stay here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:32:12.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
