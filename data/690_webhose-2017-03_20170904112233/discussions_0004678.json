A smartphone for use in Paris, bluetooth speaker, two tellies and generous with toiletries. Only gripe was the plumbing - we were on the 7th floor and had trouble with water being that high up - taps trickled, rather than ran at peak times and shower didn't always work. Staff attentive and responsive, but not much they can do about physics!\nHandily placed for metro with two stations very close by, but this was such a nice neighbourhood to explore, being in strolling distance from Le Marais, Canal St Martin, Pompidou etc, and there's a lovely farmers/ flea market a block away on Richard Lenoir. Recommended - just don't brush your teeth at same time as everyone else!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:22:13.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
