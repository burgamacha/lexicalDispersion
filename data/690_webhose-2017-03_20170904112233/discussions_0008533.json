The theme of the hotel is absolutely magical, executed through small, exquisite details (like the Dewey Decimal system rooms and the free Simon & Schuster ARCs). The Reading Room (with its 24/7 coffee and wine and cheese afternoons) was a great touch. Most importantly, though, I was astounded by the Library Hotel's incredible customer service. It was my first time visiting the city alone, but the concierge made me feel immediately welcomed and at home. The employees created a familial environment. Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in the City!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:24:05.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
