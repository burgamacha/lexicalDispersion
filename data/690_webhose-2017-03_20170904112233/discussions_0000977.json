The Scribe is just lovely and the location is great. It is one of my favorites.\nWe prefer staying in the 1st for touring and shopping...ease of walking almost everywhere.\nThe staff is just the best; bed was very comfy; wonderful linens. Bathroom was immaculate. ( loved the Hermes bathroom soap, lotions). Oh, lobby bar was cozy and welcoming. In room Keurig...buffet breakfast on the lowest level was fine.\nWe could not have been more pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:48:05.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
