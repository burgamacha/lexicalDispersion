Floor to ceiling windows with doors in the middle that you can open and look down onto the street.\nVery clean, hardwood floors, very comfortable bed and pillows. Note the shower and sink are in the room and only the toilet is in a separate space. Shower is half frosted glass with rainfall shower head. Very cool.\nBath mirror hangs from the ceiling and lights up with a touch of a button.\nParking is only a few blocks away in Chinatown. $52 for 24 hours for an SUV. The garage is a little chaotic. Attendants park it for you.\nWalking distance to SOHO and the Freedom tower, Brooklyn Bridge.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room in the front so you can overlook the street.
