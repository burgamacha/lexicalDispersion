The staff were very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. Because they were having some work done in the lobby (didn't really bother us), they upgraded one of our rooms and gave us a gift tin of biscotti. The rooms were spacious (by European standards), clean, and well appointed. Their breakfast had a variety of foods available, and the same room served as a bar and eatery in the evening. The whole place was spotless. The location is excellent, right across from the Teatro dell'Opera and walking distance to restaurants and other attractions (e.g., 15 minutes to the Coliseum). We would stay there again in a heartbeat!\nRoom Tip: I don't know that there could be a bad room in this place.
