It is advertised as a small luxury hotel and that's exactly what it was. We were lucky enough to get upgraded on check in for free to the annex 4 room building next door that they call the View at the Spanish steps--and what a view. Our window was directly over the steps with outstanding views day or night. Breakfast each morning was just outside our room shared with only the other 4rooms in this annex area. Everything was amazing and can't say enough about the property and its staff. Only down side is that the noise from the steps at night can get a bit loud but that's the price you pay for being directly in the center of everything. Maybe in middle of summer a courtyard view regular room might be indicated if that bugs you. Besides that, this place is basically flawless and central easy walking to most everything. I'll stay here if back for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:20:27.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
