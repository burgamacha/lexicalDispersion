Our kids were in a twin bedded room just down the hall which was nice but small (by American standards).\nAs a platinum they extend a complimentary breakfast daily since they don't have a lounge. The breakfast is terrific. Full service French with great pastries and fresh squeezed OJ.\nWe received especially received great service from Manon who went out of her way to accommodate us.\nThe hotel is new by Paris standards (about 11 months) and is clean, modern and chic.\nThe area is in Republique, which is not a tourist area. It is in a neighborhood with great little restaurants my favorite of which is La Bonne Cecile. Go there and tell Benedict that Kyle from Texas sent you:). He has a perfect little French bulldog share the space with him, perfect place just around the corner from the hotel.\nWe had a great stay and recommend this hotel without reservation.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:14:54.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
