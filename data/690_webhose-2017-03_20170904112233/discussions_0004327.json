Some noise could be heard from the reception area given the proximity of our room but this was only on occasion and, as we were rarely in the room unless sleeping, it didn't create any issues for us.\nThe hotel offer free coffee and cake in an afternoon downstairs which is a nice bonus and a welcome break after a busy day sightseeing.\nI would definitely recommend the hotel and would have no hesitation on returning on our next trip to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:48:26.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
