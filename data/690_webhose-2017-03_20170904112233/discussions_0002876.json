There's a subway stop a block away and it's an easy walk to Penn Station. The accommodations are very spacious for NYC, and the rate was excellent for 3 people including a King Sized bed and pull out.\nThe staff is very friendly and accommodating, although there's only one bell hop/porter so you may have to wait if someone else is having their bags brought up to their room. We had one issue with housekeeping when we asked to have our pullout made and get linens and blankets for the extra bed while we were out, but it was never done, and so we had to call late at night when we got back and wait for it.\nLike many hotels these days The Avalon charges a \"resort fee\" of $20 per night, plus tax. This is obstensively for the phone, internet. fitness room, and business center. We had issues with our internet the entire time we were there, and they did make an adjustment to our resort fees, but I think these fees are really unreasonable as you really aren't getting much for them.\nOur room faced an inner courtyard which wasn't pretty, but probably quieter than facing 5th avenue and K-Town. Housekeeping kept the room very clean, although they were pretty skimpy with the towels and washcloths like they were being rationed.\nThe hotel is a real bang for the buck. Very close to a 5 star hotel. Wish Google had half stars as this is a prototypical 4 1/2 star hotel.\nRoom Tip: K-Town gets super rowdy on the weekends, ask for a high floor.
