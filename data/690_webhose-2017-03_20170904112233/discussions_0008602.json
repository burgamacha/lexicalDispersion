The plus points included Great Staff, next door to the DLR station (Convient to get into the Capitol) BIG BED, cheaper parking than in the ExCel, and very quite rooms considering its opersite city airport. The only downside was the breakfast, they say it's complementary but in total same price as a Premier Inn B&B and was a major let down - cooked breakfast choice poor, Sausages basic, food Luke warm.. Would I stay again? On balance yes would give 5 stars if they could get there brekie right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:39:52.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
