I've stayed at various luxury hotels and the Intercontinental Grand Hotel delivers. Great location. Safe. A wonderful experience. I was previously staying at the Hilton Opera which is not in the same location but at a train station location - Gare St. Lazare. Transferring to the Intercontinental was a dream after the nightmare at HIlton Opera (St. Lazare). Be careful of names of hotels and where they claim to be. The Intercontinental Grand Hotel is truthful and staff doesn't make up stories. In France, you can ask someone for directions and if they don't know, they just make something up (e.g. Hilton Opera) while the Intercontinental Grand will go to the extra effort to truly help you./", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:26:45.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
