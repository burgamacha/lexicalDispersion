So much of the hotel is excellent - the airport transfer, the in room check in, the pool / sauna / gym, wifi performance and housekeeping.\nDuring this trip I ran into trouble for the first time. My no-smoking room smelled like a tobacco factory and there was smoking in every mens room in the hotel every time I used one. Disgusting. The moisturizor in the room burned my skin! I still have scabs one week later! While eating at the high end Italian restaurant Da Giorgio, I ordered a gin martini. Despite all the bars and restaurants in the Hyatt, no one could manage to make one. Finally, we took a private room for business in the high end Chinese restaurant Made in China. As always, the food was excellent, but there was no rhythm or reason to how the food was presented. It was all just piled on the table and as a result got cold. I've been to dozens of Chinese feasts and this one was not well done.\nOn a positive note, my stay was coincident with the Peoples' Congress, so the air was clear!\nRoom Tip: Ask to be upgraded.
