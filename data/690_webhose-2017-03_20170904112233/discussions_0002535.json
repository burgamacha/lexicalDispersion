We arrived around 9pm and checked in with no problems whatsoever. We opened the door and were greeted with a view to die for! Times Square all lit up and looking utterly awesome. The beds were really comfortable and the room was clean and airy. The bathroom was also of the same high calibre. It was sound proofed as we did open the window one night and heard all the work going on during the night to keep New York clean. But the room was temperature controlled so there was no need to open the windows at all! It looked just like the photos. The terrace had a great view too. Everything about this hotel was just fantastic. From the minute we arrived to the time we left we felt very comfortable, the hotel staff were all amazing, very friendly and polite.. Nothing was too much trouble.The hotel is situated in a great spot and within easy walking distance of most of the main attractions. I loved New York and the Novotel so much I am returning to them both in November with my husband!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:51.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
