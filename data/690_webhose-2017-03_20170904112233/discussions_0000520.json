The staff is so friendly; they all remember you very quickly after check-in. Debra, in particular, is a star! She is the Operations Manager, and she keeps this place running at top-notch.\nThree great examples of going above and beyond when it comes to customer service: 1. At one point, the wifi went down. Debra saw that my colleague and I were working from the cafe, so she brought her own hot spot to ensure we still had internet connectivity. 2. I ordered a Coke Zero from the restaurant, and they had run out. One of the employees quickly popped out to the shop to pick up some more for me. 3. We left early on a weekend morning, just before the breakfast service started. My colleague asked the chef if he could pack us a to-go breakfast. He gladly obliged, packing us a lovely breakfast for the road that we enjoyed on the way to our safari!\nRaymond, Kenneth, Debra and all of the staff truly made our stay at Humura memorable!! I can definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely sanctuary with great service in the city of Kampala!! Haven't been to Kampala before? Humura is a good reason to visit!!\nRoom Tip: Stay on the floor by the pool...room #9 is great as there is only one neighbour!!
