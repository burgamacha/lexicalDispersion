The staff and service were excellent the entire stay. The cafe offering free breakfast and snacks daily was good! Even after we checked out, they remained extremely helpful and stored our bags for us and let us borrow an umbrella while we walked around in the rain for a couple hours before heading back home. It is steps away from Times Square and walking distance to 5th Avenue and Central Park! If this hotel could have a good view along with the spacious and clean rooms it would get a 6 star rating in my book :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:07:26.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
