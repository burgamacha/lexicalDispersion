The d√©cor is a little bit dated but it is spotlessly clean. After a long day walking, you can make use of the hotel roof terrace overlooking the Santa Maria Maggiore. The hotel is also 5 minute walk from the main train station in Rome (connection to airport, and metro system). The breakfast is standard continental (no full English) and was very nice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:05:36.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
