We were able to look out our window and see the Eiffel Tower which was truly spectacular. Hotel is located a 2 minute walk from the Ecole Militaire metro station and a 5 minute walk to be within the full view of the Eiffel Tower and less than 15 minutes to be right beneath it. The room itself is quite small, the bed however was huge and very comfortable. My only issue with the room was that you could very clearly hear people walking around the room in heels above our room almost all night. We did not stay for breakfast here so couldn't comment on that but there are fabulous places along the walk to the Eiffel Tower that you could stop for breakfast at. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Would recommend if you are looking for a great base that is within walking distance of the main site of Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:54:04.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
