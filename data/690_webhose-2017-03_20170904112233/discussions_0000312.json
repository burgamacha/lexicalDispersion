We got a room on the third floor with a view out over the Pantheon plaza. Wauw!\nThe room was not the biggest, but up-to-date and suited our needs. Bed was good and bathroom nice, modern and clean. Overall very satisfied witht the room - especially for the price!\nBreakfast was good and offered plenty to choose from.\nStaff was very helpfull and kind. They guided us to a very good family restaurant close by and to a good coffeeshop.\nLocation is absolutely perfect and you cant really get any better. Almost all of the best sites in Rome is within walking distance and there are many busses close by.\nThe only caveat is that the wifi can be slow a peak hours, bordering unusable, but this was not an issue for us, since we got free international data.\nI cannot recommend this place enough and we a definitely comming back when we find such a good discounted prize again.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a view of the patheon plaza See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:20:18.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
