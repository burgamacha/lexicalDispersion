We wanted a hotel in Midtown that was walking distance from many of the places that we wanted to visit. The Chandler lived up to that! It is in a great location! The hotel was clean, comfortable, and the staff did everything they could to make our stay even better. When we needed extra towels, directions to the nearest subway station, or help finding a cab in the middle of a St. Patrick's Day parade, they were wonderful! They always had a smile on their face.\nThe only complaint that we had was that our room was slightly small and the only windows overlooked the fire escape and brick walls. That was slightly disappointing, but we managed as most of the time we were only in the room at night time. The furnace would not turn on during one occasion but they immediately sent an engineer to the room. The staff was really something that made this hotel special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:26:30.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
