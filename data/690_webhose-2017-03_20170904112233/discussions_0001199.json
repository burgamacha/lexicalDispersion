Buses go past the door and the hotel de Ville metro is a short walk away. The service was very good and extremely helpful which is always a bonus in Paris. The rooms are interestingly decorated if on the small side. There are a number of bars and restaurants close by which makes it easy to relax after a long day. We felt it was value for money and would certainly go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:36:36.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
