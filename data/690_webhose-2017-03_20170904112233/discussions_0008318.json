Fear not - this hotel is really special. For starters the building is a national monument - Napoleon and Josephine used to dance in its ballroom. So the bar is set high - and remains consistently so throughout. Staff are friendly, courteous and efficient. Rooms v well presented (if funds permit get club room access - excellent facilities throughout the day). The Cafe de la\nPaix restaurant is a great place to eat, especially after a performance at the Palais Garnier just across the road. Great metro and bus (including hop on hop off bus) connections right on ur doorstep. All in all a great and uplifting place to stay and explore the city of light.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:24:19.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
