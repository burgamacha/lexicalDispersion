Excellent service, food and apartment quality and amenities. Location is excellent and arrangement of the premises around a courtyard is very attractive. Very minor issues encountered in a 5 day stay, overall a very enjoyable experience. Will definitely return and highly recommend the property. Only drawbacks are the proximity of a school and its playground, which can be very noisy for rooms closest to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:22:24.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
