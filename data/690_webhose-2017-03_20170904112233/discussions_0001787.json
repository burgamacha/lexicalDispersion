CAPUDEAN!\"\nI've been lucky enough to stay twice in this wonderful property of ACCOR HOTELS.\nThere's nothing to compare it with. The history of this place is as overwhelming as it's beauty.\nAMAZING MASTERPIECE! That's how I'd describe it. Art everywhere.\nAmazing views over the most impressive pool in Paris and delicious food. That, combined with outstanding service makes MOLITOR my most favourite place in Paris.\nRoom Tip: All rooms are facing the pool. It's simply amazing!
