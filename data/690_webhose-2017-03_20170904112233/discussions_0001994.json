We enjoyed our stay there the hotel was clean and tidy the staff were always helpful and it was close to the metro stations and lots of restaurants and bars\nThe only issue we had was we discovered that a cleaner was helping themselves to some of our own personal alcohol. We addressed this reception and they were concerned to hear about this\nAll in all a very good stay and would stay there again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:32:54.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
