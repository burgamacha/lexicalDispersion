We love this hotel, the location can't be beat. We opt for a privilege room with city view and it was well worth the extra cost, the room was spacious and beautiful. We love the balcony overlooking the streets and the Arc de Triomphe.\nWhat makes this hotel even more special were the staff. They are so wonderful at this hotel, they were warm and welcoming, very helpful with our questions. They were concerned for our safety, reminding us to be careful around the city with the branches falling from the trees on windy days. Coming back to the hotel from a long day of sightseeing always feel like coming home. Prior to arrival we email the hotel and they helped us to make reservation for dinner at one of the restuarants nearby, without the help of Mr Farooq it would have been impossible for us to be able to get that reservation. Thank you to the entire staff for making our stay special. I wish the staff would wear name tags so I can mention them by names.\nSplendid Etoile will definitely be our hotel when we return to Paris with our family. We highly recommend this hotel.\nTips:\n1: Leave your room key at the front desk before going out! One night we left the hotel without leaving our key at the front desk, when we came back well after midnight the hotel front door was locked and the front desk lights turned off. Panic set in for a few minutes as we scramble to find a way to get a hold of the hotel personnel. Luckily my husband found a doorbell button on the side and we rung the bell like there was no tomorrow. After a few minutes one of the staff members came out and open the door for us. He said when he checked there was no keys left at the desk so he presumed everyone was already in their rooms, he locked the door for a restroom break. In a way it did brings us some comfort knowing the front door is lock after all the guests have resigned for the night.\n2: If your room rate don't include breakfast do consider eating breakfast at least one day, you won't regret it.\n3: Airfrance \"Le Bus Direct\" to and from the airport is one street over from the hotel. We used the bus to and from the airport, it was convenient. Metro lift is right outside of the hotel, we used it extensively while we were there.\n4: If it's your first time in Paris download the RATP app to navigate the metro system, it will save you time, money and headaches. It was our tool to get around Paris and beyond, it also works offline so it was great. Make sure to download it before your trip and test it out before getting to Paris.\n5: Please be kind to the staff they are wonderful, hard working people.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:58:01.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
