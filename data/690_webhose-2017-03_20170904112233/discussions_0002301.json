There is nothing particularly amazing about this hotel, nothing to make it truly stand out. However, it is tastefully furnished, charming, with a friendly accueil, it has a nice location, and prices are reasonable.\nRooms range from very small to medium-sized, and quite a few face an interior courtyard. Yet all of them have an attention to detail with nice sheets, drapes, and tapestries. Beds are good as well. A complementary tea is offered in the afternoon.\nAlothether, a well-managed, elegant little hotel in one of Paris' nicest neighborhoods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:57:00.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
