A very comfortable base for our family's week long trip to London at Christmastime, the Arbor City is around the corner from the Tube and bus lines that easily take you to all the main sights in London. If you like to walk, it is not far from the City, Tower of London, as well as the amenities in Shoreditch, a very lively restaurant and bar scene. The staff were friendly and helpful with directions on how to get around and general useful suggestions and arranged to smoothly get us to Heathrow early on New Years Eve as many of London's main streets were closing for the upcoming festivities. Couldn't recommend it highly enough!\nRoom Tip: Our room overlooked Brick Lane, but was quite surprisingly quiet throughout.
