Have stayed several times and always great. Clean and modern, great security, yet have done a great job of retaining the classic old French chateau feel with modern d√©cor and design. The pool is wonderful; staff is wonderful. Some touches that go beyond other luxury hotels.. free minibar (non-alchohol), free movies, private boxes for newpapers. Never heard a peep from neighboring rooms. If you let them know arrival time a few days in advance (e.g. from an international flight arriving early).. they will try hard to get you into room early. This is a huge blessing if you are arriving on a flight from USA early in the morning and need a shower / nap. Other hotels make you wait until the official 3 or 4pm checking in time and encourage you to pay for the night before... the Pen does a good job of balancing all their international arrivals and departures. Just love this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:35:33.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
