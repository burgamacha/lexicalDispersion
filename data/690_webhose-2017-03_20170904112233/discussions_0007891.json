Good design and excellent service. That said, the hotel needs refreshing. Lots of scratches and chips in furniture, carpet is torn at entry to bath and missing tiles in bath.\nI stayed on 25th floor and it was very quiet. My non-smoking room was getting some smoke odors-- maybe a neighboring room or HVAC? I'd have shared my disappointment of needed repairs with management if someone had asked me how my stay was-- but they didn't. I'd stay here again, because it's a good value for the price and the location is great if you are doing business in midtown or going to the theatre.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:19:06.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
