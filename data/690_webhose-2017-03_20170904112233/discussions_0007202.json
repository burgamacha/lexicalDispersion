The beds and rooms are very clean, my room also had a full kitchen.\nThere is no 'dinner' available but 2 pubs within short walk. As you go out door to the right there is a nice but busy pub 2 mins away. If you go left then next left, 5 mins away was 'The Rose', quieter and really nice.\nLarge breakfast option included in price. Tube 5 mins away, didn't use, was uber'ing and they were only ever 2 mins away.\nOverall excellent, quiet, clean hotel. Would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:02:29.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
