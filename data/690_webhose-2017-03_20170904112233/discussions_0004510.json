This elegant little hotel has an amazing story in history and will make your Paris trip much more enjoyable. The staff will go out of their way to make your stay an amazing experience. There are rooms with a small balacony and some that look out onto the street. The rooms are on the smaller side, but this is Paris and space is limited in the older places. The rooms are thoughtfully laid out so the use of the space is very functional. We stayed in room #601 and had a small balcony overlooking the courtyard. The staff has \"pre-bought\" tickets to the museums so ask them before heading out as you can get in the \"pre-bought tickets\" line so it will save you some time waiting.\nRoom Tip: Room #601 has a balcony over the courtyard.
