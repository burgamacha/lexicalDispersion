My reason for choosing the hotel was cost as I was on a tight budget. I've stayed in cheap London hotels before so I wasn't expecting much but I was really pleased my choice.\nThe room was quite large and was exceptionally clean, as was the en-suite. There were also plenty of tea and coffee to drink and the cups were actual real size cups & not the little cups you get in some big chain hotels. This might seem trivial but when I want a cup of tea, I want a proper cup of tea.\nThere was plenty of toiletries in the bathroom and the shower was amazing!!\nThe staff were very friendly and helpful.\nIf I ever go to Shepherds Bush again, I'd definitely stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:24:50.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
