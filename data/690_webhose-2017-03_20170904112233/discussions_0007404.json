We love the filtered water and complimentary water bottle, in-room stability ball and yoga mat, stand-up desk, workout zone in room, top-quality workout center and comfy bed. My kids LOVED the ping pong table downstairs and it served as a nice break from all the walking around New York City. This is also a great location south of Times Square but close to the High Line, Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen and Madison Square Garden. Great if you want to go to Times Square but stay out of the chaos!\nRoom Tip: Choose a floor with a filtered water machine See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:10:51.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
