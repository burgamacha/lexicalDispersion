The ladies at the desk checked us in and found that our room was actually just about ready and offered us to head to the breakfast area for some food while they got the room finished up. Fifteen minutes later we were in our room able to get settled in and get started on our day. All employees we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast wasn't the typical continental fare. Instead, fresh hot breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage with toast, bagels, and cereals to go along with different juices and fresh hot coffee. Our room was clean, and while small, it was roomy for New York standards. Great access to the subway just 2 blocks away as well. The rooftop had a great view easily being able to locate several of Manhattan's landmarks. Great location, good price, and the best towels of any hotel we have stayed. The only drawback was the room could have used a couple more electrical outlets. Hotel is also pretty new and very clean as well. We would highly recommend the LIC for the total package for the New York visitor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:46:08.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
