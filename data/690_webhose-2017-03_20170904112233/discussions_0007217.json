He called the kitchen to make sure this would be ok and later that evening we received a call to our room to ask if there was anything in particular we would need to have available.\nThe breakfasts are served in Jamie's Italian adjoining restaurant and are a buffet style. Unfortunately despite our call to and from the kitchen the poor chef hadn't been given the message and so he was unprepared for our arrival. He kindly made us a vegan sausage and avocado on toast, which was lovely but we did have to ask the same waitress 4 times for some soya milk before she eventually brought it out so the service was slow and we were on a tight schedule!\nThe hotel is modern, clean and a great location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:01:32.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
