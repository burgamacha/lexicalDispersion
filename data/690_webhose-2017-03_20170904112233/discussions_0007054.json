We were really impressed by the service of the staff. Extremely friendly, and so very helpful when helping us pick out a place to eat or find directions. They even bought us tickets to the museums so we didn't have to wait in line!\nThe room itself was very clean, and well appointed. Very comfortable bed and pillows. A little on the small side - but it's a boutique hotel in Paris, so that's expected.\nAnother thing that needs to be mentioned is the location - we couldn't have picked a better neighborhood to stay in. Still very close to the action and bustle of Paris, but the few blocks surrounding the hotel was refreshingly non-touristy. Many small artisan shops and cafes, perfect for people watching while sipping on espresso. :) I was surprised to find that this is kind of an expensive neighborhood, considering the great value of this hotel.\nAll in all, I am so happy that we decided to stay at Hotel Odeon Saint-Germain. I would absolutely recommend it for anyone staying in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:51:28.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
