The lighting was flattering and the sinks were the perfect size and depth. Also love that the sinks weren't under-mounted.\nI've always hated the drive from Manhattan to LaGuardia and vice versa, both the cost and the length, and this hotel solves that problem. I'm perfectly happy to take the subway to Manhattan, stay on the island all day, and return to the hotel in the evening. Now that I've discovered this hotel, I would never stay in Manhattan ever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:22:05.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
