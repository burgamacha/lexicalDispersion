The front desk staff was very polite; they even helped us book a taxi for our return which was in the early hours.\nThe location is very good being right next to Paddington station (Heathrow Express, which is well worth it) and the Edgware tube station.\nThe hotel room is small but comfortable, and it has what it takes for a good stay. The cleaning is done every three days which did not bother us at all.\nNext to the hotel there are several cafes and restaurants, including a 24h supermarket just across the street.\nI highly recommend the hotel, and will definitely stay at it on my next visit to London.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a hotel on the higher floors, it has a slight noise from the tube.
