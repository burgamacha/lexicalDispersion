It was chilly outside,19 degrees outside and dropping. We only went out to eat, very deliberate sigh seeing and a movie. The location of the hotel was perfect for everything we needed. We stayed for 3 nights and the service was really good.\nThe room was cozy and warm, very clean. HBO was available and we absolutely loved the complimentary rose hip and lavender lotion, (I already ordered some for myself). We plan on staying again at this hotel in the summer and look forward to exploring the neighborhood in warmer weather. (Just know that there are 2 buildings for this hotel, they are across the street from each other).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:31:23.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
