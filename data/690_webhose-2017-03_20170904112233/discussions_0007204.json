Friendly, helpful, and prompt. I requested a room with a fridge (traveling with children) when I booked online through a third party site, and one was promptly brought up to the room at arrival without me reminding them! The renovation in 2016 was well done. It's a beautiful hotel! The small exercise room was nice. For an NYC hotel room with two double beds, it was incredibly spacious. On the 7th floor we heard no noise with a courtyard window. Covina restaurant has awesome salads and pizza and friendly staff. Great location for the metro and other restaurants. Bagel shop next door was super friendly and delicious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:40:06.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
