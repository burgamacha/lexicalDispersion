Tucked into a back street with an entry onto Fleet St, the Temple Court was an excellent hotel. Not grand but comfortable and with great staff. The in house restaurant was fine. Good food at reasonable prices I'd you can't be bothered going out. A 10 min walk to many theatres and 15 min to Trafalgar Square. Good breakfast, but eggs etc are extra. I had a great room. Right at the back of the hotel i could see a distant view of the Thames and the Oxo sign. Large bathroom and a small sitting room. Plenty of cupboards. Iron in the room too. Nespresso machine also. Great linen and towels. I will stay here again. Not a crazy price for London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:12:20.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
