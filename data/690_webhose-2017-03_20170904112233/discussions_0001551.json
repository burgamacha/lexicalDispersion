I was not able to reach the hotel via email or via their online contact form prior to my stay to arrange some things which had me un-easy with my choice in this hotel. However, being welcomed to the hotel with much warmth and hospitality by the staff after a long flight, and the high quality and rich amenities of the hotel made up for any pre-stay mishaps. Would highly recommend the hotel and hope they resolve the inability to email or utilize their online contact form for pre-stay arrangements. Hope to visit again soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:49:32.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
