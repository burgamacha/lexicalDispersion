My husband and I speak very little French. The staff were most accommodating showing us a map of the city and the places to visit.\nAfter unpacking I reaslised I'd forgotten to pack a plug adapter, I went to reception who were more than happy to lend me one for the duration of our stay.\nThe rooms were spotless and very clean. We did not have the breakfast so I cannot comment. However I'd highly recommend hotel tourisme avenue.\nIt's also right by the metro so if you are not up for walking, getting around the city is super easy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:49:00.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
