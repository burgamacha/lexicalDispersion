It is strategically located and within walking distance to the Hussman boulevard which is the shopping district of Paris department stores like the Gallriers Lafayette.\nThe Repblic Metro is just outside the door and so is the bustop.\nThere are a number of nice Bistros, cafes and eateries around the hotel and you can find almost every possible cuisine within 5 mins walking distance of the hotel.\nThe rooms are done up tastefully but can be a tight fit if you are travelling with large suitcases. I particularly liked the design of the bathroom and the amenities provided were good. Overall the rooms are clean and fresh which is often not the case for hotels in Europe as a whole. It was worth the money spent.\nFor me what makes a hotel special as the staff and I can definite say the team at the Renaissance Republic hotel are very warm and accomodating fulfilled all my requests: my wish for a hot cup of masala tea in the morning, ensured we had a room on time as we landed rather early.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:15:06.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
