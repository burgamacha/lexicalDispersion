Took my mom for a girls get away and it was very nice stay. Check in was easy and the staff was very courteous. The door men, Claudio and Damon were excellent! I hope I have their names right. Anyway, the Spectacular King room was a tad bit small. But I was in New York City so we made do. The only thing that I could complain about was the price of parking. It cost $153 to valet park for 2 days. This price does not include going in and out. That will cost another $73.
