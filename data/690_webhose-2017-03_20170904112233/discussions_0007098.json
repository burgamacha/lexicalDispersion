It was my fourth visit to NYC, and I wanted to explore a little more of the \"local\" NYC rather than the touristy stuff, so I decided to head south of all the tourist traps but still be central enough to see it all. Hilton Fashion District was the perfect choice.\nA fresh feeling place that was clean and well appointed, I was lucky enough to score the high-floor room I'd requested, and had a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was small, but there was plenty of room for bags and to spread out comfortably. The wifi was fast, the room was clean, and satisfied all my needs. There was only a shower in the bathroom, rather than a bath, in following with the compact nature of the room, but this was also fine. The decor was a bit funky, and the view was suitably damped by block-out blinds so I could rest in the mornings after some very, very late NYC party nights!\nThe hotel is in a great spot, being walking distance to Madison Square Gardens, and to Madison Square Park too. There are plenty of shops close by, and a good selection of bars and food spots just further up 26th past 6th Ave. The onsite bar and grill is also very good, certainly a step up from the usual middle-of-the-road type places you get in hotels, plus they have a rooftop bar too! The rooftop bar was cool, but you could only get snacks and the beer selection was a little small, but nonetheless, it's a great place to start the night. The hotel is also within walking distance (if you like walking) to the usual tourist spots around Times Square, Central Park, and in the other direction, Little Italy and the East Village are far but walkable (about 20 mins or so). So it's a perfect location!\nStaff were always very pleasant, and very willing to help with any needs (tickets, rides to the airport, requests, and the like). I was pretty pleased with my stay. The hotel is not a big flashy place like some of the other Hiltons, and the rooms are smaller, but it is still definitely worthy of the brand, and has a more local feel than a touristy feel. I'd stay here again, no question!\nRoom Tip: Definitely go for a high floor, north facing if you can, so you can see the majestic Empire State Bu...
