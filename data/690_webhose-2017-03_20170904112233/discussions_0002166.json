Very clean and modern design. The staff was very nice. I read other reviews that said the rooms were small, maybe I was staying in a bigger room both times, because I found the rooms to be much bigger than a standard NYC room. The marble and brass bathrooms are very trendy right now and they did a great job of leveraging both. The subway is right there, which is convenient, although on the lower floors you can hear the rumble a bit. I also love that they don't have a standard receptionist/check-in desk. Instead they have a very intimate check-in process on the first floor, and a concierge on the 2nd floor in the Library where they serve free coffee in the mornings. Overall, a great experience at a great price. I've stayed twice and will stay again in the future.\nRoom Tip: Try to stay on a higher floor to avoid noise from the subway.
