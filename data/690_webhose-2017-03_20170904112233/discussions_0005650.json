It is a couple of blocks from Penn Station, Macy's and the Empire State Building. It is a half block from the 34th St./Herald Square subway station. It is clean and basic. The free breakfast has just enough to get you on your way; yogurt, bagels, cereal, apples and coffee/tea.\nThe beds were clean and comfy. They offer rooms with twin beds, which is what my daughter and I prefer; they aren't always available. They appear to be slowly upgrading aspects of the hotel. I agree that the elevator is slow. We always used the stairs to go down to the lobby.\nThe service was a bit inconsistent. I requested additional towels and they were delivered to our room promptly. On another occasion I asked if I could get a couple of plastic spoons (we'd picked up a quick snack on our way back to the hotel one evening). I was told that \"the breakfast staff handles them\" and it was suggested that I run across the street to another location. Really??\nOverall, our stay at the Hotel Stanford was exactly what we needed. A clean, central location that we used to venture out into a fabulous city. It was a great value. I would certainly stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:10:42.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
