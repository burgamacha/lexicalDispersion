Ended up loving the place. First, the staff was incredibly flexible and helped us out so much with our changing plans (we booked one person for a day but ended up being 2 people for nearly a week)! Staff went above and beyond. The hotel grounds were full of lush green plants and tall trees--it's beautifully done and would be great for a casual, family event. In short: Laid back, easy going, superb staff,\naffordable and good for families. Tip: Pay extra for the bigger room and keep an eye out for birds and other wildlife in the tree tops outside the window.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:08:16.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
