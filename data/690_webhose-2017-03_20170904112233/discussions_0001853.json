Loved the decor of this boutique hotel. The staff were excellent very helpful. Adrian from the bar was very friendly which is great to keep the bar welcoming and relaxing after a long day of sight seeing. The location of this hotel was perfect for us as a base. The rooms were not overly big but very comfortable and clean, the only thing i missed in the room was some kind of dressing table or somewhere to put things down but it wasn't a big enough problem to take anything away from this hotel. Over all we had an excellent few days here and would definitely return again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:52:58.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
