It was everything we could have wanted in a reasonably priced hotel in the Marais area. Close to the metro and with plenty to see of interest in the immediate area it is an excellent base from which to explore the rest of Paris. The rooms, although small are lovely with lots of nice touches like the free and daily restocked mini bar containing soft drinks and snacks. The staff are friendly and helpful and recommended some lovely restaurants in the area. We will certainly be back to Hotel Caron.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:50:36.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
