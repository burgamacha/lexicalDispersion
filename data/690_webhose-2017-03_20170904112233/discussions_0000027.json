And as a layover after an exhausting international flight. Parking rates are average and lot is patrolled. Very Convenient and punctual airport shuttle. Many flight crews use this same hotel. Quiet rooms, even with freeway and airport nearby. MAX's Restaurant nearby is a good short car ride. Lots of other restaurants in San Mateo by car.\nBed comfortable and room a pleasant ambiance. If you have kids, the pool is a welcome amenity. I like it too. Hotel Lobby very nice to meet guests, nice view of bay and plans landing. the Hotel Restaurant is good too. I felt it was a family safe environment.\nIf you want to get some exercise there is a paved walking trail along SF Bay next to hotel. The location is perfect for the airport and has been a weekend getaway cause they have the pool and San Mateo has some good restaurants.\nSF 49s have hosted team events here too, I've met players in the parking lot and lobby.\nRoom Tip: The bay side rooms have a nice view, they also view jets landing. Quieter than you would imagine. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:33:19.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
