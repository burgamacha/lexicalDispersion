Therefore we sadly cannot comment on the hotel restaurant.\nThe hotel has a pool which is tiny. It's great for people just chilling/socialising and obviously is great for kids. It is located near the hotel bar so people congregate there as part of their evening 'wind down'. However, if you are a swimmer - forget it! (Thanks to a helpful member of the hotel staff, I found a larger swimming pool in a nearby hotel).\nOur room was small and quite dark but our bed was insanely comfortable! The bathroom was tiny but had a good shower. Aircon and heating worked well.\nWe had a really wonderful stay in New York and we really enjoyed the hotel.\nOne word of advice when you arrive at JFK, make sure you don't get fleeced by unscrupulous taxi drivers - the fee should only be around $75 to the hotel, so be sure to ask before you accept a ride!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:42.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
