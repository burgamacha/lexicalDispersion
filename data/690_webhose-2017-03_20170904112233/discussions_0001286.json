The first time I came here was November 2014 and was pleasantly surprised to find out that some of the rooms have patios!! There's nothing like being in the middle of Manhattan in a decent hotel room, not overly expensive, that has outdoor patio! There's even grass! This is a great secret in Manhattan and I just gave it away! My girlfriend will beat me if the next time she tries to get one of the rooms and can't because of a review by me! A big plus! By the way, the breakfast is also pretty decent along with the staff makes this Manhattan hotel an enjoyable stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:23:54.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
