Since the Hotel adjoins the Westside Stratford Mall, one couldn't ask for a better location. We had loads of options for food as well as for shopping. Coffee Shops, Greek Restaurant, Microbrewery Pub, Waitrose Supermarket, Indian/Asian food; you name it and it was all there! We had a view of the West Ham United Football Stadium and even walked down to it. A strategic location, if I may call it that!\nRoom Tip: Take one of the higher floors only and ideally one that faces the Stadium.
