A real boutique hotel in a converted Haussmann-style apartment block. It's well located in the centre of Paris while still quiet. The nearest metro line (line 1) will take you to La Defence or Gare de Lyon without changing.\nStaff are friendly and polite and my room was clean with all amenities needed.\nTwo problems though:\n- my room was very small, to the point that it was difficult to walk around the bed. Even the bath tub is small. I am not sure how a couple could comfortably spend time in the room once out of bed.\nThat, the management can't do anything about it. Take it or leave it.\n- The wifi was terrible. Not only slow but also you need to give your e-mail address when registering and the system will only take one device with the same e-mail address. So phone and ipad: 2 different email addresses. Also, every time you disconnect from the wifi, you have to go through the same typing of e-mail address and password. That's easy to sort out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:28:59.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
