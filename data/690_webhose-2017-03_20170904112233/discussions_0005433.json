Ideally placed for Times Square (500 metre walk and you're in Times Square. Top rated hotel BUT beware the food is exceptionally high priced as is most eateries in the area. (cost us around Â£55 for 2 breakfasts!!). Room and hotel in general very top spec and clean. Staff very helpful. Would stay there again but as I say beware of costs of meals. No outside noise considering close proximity to night life\nRoom Tip: We had room 2310 which as I say gives a side view to Times Square See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:22.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
