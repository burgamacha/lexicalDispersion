The personal is friendly and professional.\nAlways love the coffee station for early check-out and great afternoon perfect for long meetings in the lobby.\nThe rooms are extremely spacious and very comfortable, love the shoes polishing service.\nI will definitely recommend this hotel, the Italian restaurant is also a must try when in Beijing. I can just not wait for the top bar to hotel.\nSpecial mention to Andrew, the GM such a great host and always so helpful all my requests!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:11:44.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
