We traveled with our three children (ages 9, 11 and 16) and their grandmother, and everyone loved their stay. We had a regular room (for me, my husband and 11 year old son) and a junior suite (shared by our daughters and their grandmother). The suite gave provided and additional area to gather and also eat on those nights some didn't feel like going out to dinner and preferred to get something from a nearby shop. The hotel was the perfect place to begin our site-seeing each morning and to return at the end of the day. It is centrally located and an easy walk to Westminster, Buckingham Palace and the tube. We loved the mix of the building's classic charm and the hotel's modern amenities. Breakfast, in particular, was a treat each morning. We very much appreciate the special care the staff took with our daughters, who are both gluten free (Celiac), ensuring they received GF food directly from the kitchen and taking precautions to limit the chances of cross-contamination. We also enjoyed the hotel's bars a few nights after the kids were in tucked in bed. We're looking forward to our next trip to London and St. James' Court will be our first choice - whether traveling with family or as a couple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:05:47.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
