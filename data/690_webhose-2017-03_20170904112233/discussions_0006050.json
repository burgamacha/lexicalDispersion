Room ready. Got a nice spacious room with all one needs for a business stay. Had a good nights sleep. Check-out equally fast and friendly. Downside: nothing much (or at all) to do in the area - did not see any restaurant but given it rained heavily I also did not start walking around to look for one. Dinner at the hotel restaurant was ok - for a french benchmark vs. what one would get at a Brasserie, it was mediocre and simply too costly. Had the Burger, a soup, glass of wine and a coffee and paid over EUR 60. Would stay there again for a very late arrival and early departure as the location is good if you have to go to one of the DÃ©fense office buildings. For anything else and longer, would prefer to be in town. Also, to add, WLAN is slow and the complimentary service is slow and limited in data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:50:09.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
