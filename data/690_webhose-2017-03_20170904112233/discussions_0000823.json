Lovely roof garden and polite, helpful staff.\nI particularly liked the little notes left around the room that were informative, friendly and polite.\nLast thing to say was that the room was exceptionally clean and TV was of a high quality. Great picture.\nWould definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:16:27.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
