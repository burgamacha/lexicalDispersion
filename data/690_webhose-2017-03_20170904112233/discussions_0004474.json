The location is great for visiting anyhing in the center of Rome, as it is very close to some of the greatest sights. The hotel itself is on a very beautiful, quiet street. The staff we met - Alex, Valentina, Barbara are all eager to help in any way possible, we really enjoyed their advice and chats. Don't miss the breakfast on the rooftop - great quality of ingredients and a superb view. All in all, an excellent stay! Ps must visit to the \"dungeons\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:37:45.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
