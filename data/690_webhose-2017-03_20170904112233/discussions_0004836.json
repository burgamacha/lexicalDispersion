The boutique brand of the Hyatt Hotels group offers chic modern surroundings, innovative room features and a foot print that is about twice the size of regular NYC hotel rooms.\nThe rooms are in good condition. Our only complaint was the room ran a bit hot, but that was easily remedied by opening the window. The hotel offers 24/7 coffee, tea and snack service in the lobby - it's a nice touch.\nThe location was a 4 minute walk to the Staten Island Ferry...a 10 minute walk to the Statue of Liberty ferry. Subway service is a short 4 minutes away. It's convenient to may lower Manhattan venues.\nThe staff is oh so friendly, efficient and polite. Overall, a really good stay and a good value for the money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:01:58.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
