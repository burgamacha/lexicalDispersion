The hotel is located near Waterloo station, which is very convenient for me. It's on the site of an old maternity hospital, and their are some pleasing architectural reminders around the hotel.\nCheck in was quick and efficient. I asked for an iron, and it was delivered to my room almost at once. My room was spacious and light. There's a lot of construction going on nearby, but I wasn't troubled by any noise from this.\nStaff were helpful and friendly. Returning to the hotel at 0130hr, a colleague asked for a peppermint teabag, and was presented, with a smile, with a selection of fruit and herbal teas.\nBreakfast was good (though not cheap); again, pleasant, helpful staff were in evidence. Bad points were the absence of side plates, and a hopeless conveyor belt toaster, which offered the option of barely warmed (one pass), or burnt (two passes).\nThis hotel's biggest attraction, though, is its location - close to the centre and an ideal base for a London visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:25:09.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
