The public areas are modern, sleek, well-designed and well-maintained. The service at the concierge desk was excellent and the staff all friendly and eager to help. The room was luxurious, perfectly clean and very well kept - the bed was incredibly comfortable!!! The food in both the Fratelli Fresh and the Garden restaurants was excellent. The location was perfect for me - it was just a short walk to the Beijing Today Art Museum. I'm sure it would be easy and inexpensive to catch a taxi to any more central tourist locations. Overall, an excellent stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone for both business or leisure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:28:34.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
