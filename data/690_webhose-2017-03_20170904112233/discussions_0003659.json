Our room was on the 5th floor with a great view to the cathedral. The wifi worked very well. As we arrived at the beginning of March we were afraid that it could be cold in a room, but the heating was working very well so it was warm and comfortable. The room was cleaned and the towels were changed every day. There is a safe and minibar in a room. The hotel is in an area which is very local, calm and safe. We loved that nice hotel and would like to come back again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:25:31.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
