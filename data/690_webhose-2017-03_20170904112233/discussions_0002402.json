Our room on the second floor had been upgraded to a premier room by the management,at no extra cost, and was more spacious than we had expected. Beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean, we could not have hoped for better. It was handy for the Metro at Cadet, and a three day ticket allowed us to get everywhere that we wanted to visit. David at reception was kind enough to confirm the bookings we had for visits and taxi to the airport, because our French is from schooldays, years ago!\nAll the staff were so friendly, and, even when we returned after having been out until midnight, it was good to have somebody at reception at all times! We tried to speak French as much as we could, although we need not have worried, because the staff could understand the gist of what were were trying to say, and could , in the main, speak back to us in English.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as an excellent base from which to explore the beautiful city of Paris. Although we were perhaps too early in the season for the flowers and blossoms to come out, and the weather was a bit chilly, the warmth of the good people of Paris will forever leave a mark with me...a happy reminder of my birthday celebrations. Many thanks, again\nRoom Tip: Second floor corner room was quiet, no 27 Subject: 26th February Hi Service Team Leaders Th...
