Though the rooms are somewhat small compared to present day standards, they offer all of the niceties one might expect. Comfortable beds, real glasses rather than plastic cups and wonderful chocolates on the pillows at night. We were in room 303 just one floor up from the breakfast room where wine, cheese and assorted crackers were served each afternoon. In the morning the room was abuzz with friendly staff offering juices, hard boiled eggs, pastries and wonderful coffee. They also had big machine for espresso or cappuccino.\nA wonderful visit would certainly recommend the Casablanca to anyone looking for a pleasant place to stay while in NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:07:11.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
