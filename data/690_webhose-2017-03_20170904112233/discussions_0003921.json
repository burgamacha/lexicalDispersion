Room was a good size and very comfortable (although heating difficult to adjust). Breakfast was great - great selection, regularly replenished and breakfast room was really spacious with excellent views. Only slight drawback was the elevators (particularly in the mornings) which were very slow. Overall though a great hotel and facilitated an excellent trip in NYC.\nRoom Tip: Room on higher floor are quiet with great views See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:48:54.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
