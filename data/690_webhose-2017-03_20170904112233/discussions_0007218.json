It is a hotel and is in the process of being transformed into a vacation club resort. The rooms are not as spacious as the usual vacation club suites. There is no kitchen nor microwave. But they do have the small fridge. The room, especially the bathrooms are clean. The beddings are of Marriott standard, very comfortable. It is just off 5th avenue and is walking distance to the empire state building. It is accessible to both taxi cab and subway. It has a small gym that served it's purpose. You do a lot of walking in NYC anyways. The staff were very accommodating. Even if the facility is still undergoing renovations, service is already that of a vacation club property.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:34:57.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
