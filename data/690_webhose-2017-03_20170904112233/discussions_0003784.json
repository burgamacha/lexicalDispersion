The rooms were on the smaller side (which is to be expected in NYC) and there was no bathtub in my Empire State view double room, but in general it was a good experience. The beds were amazingly comfortable. One night I slept 12 hours straight because I was so cozy.\nThe bathrooms have good amenities, and there is a great bar upstairs called the Spyglass with beautiful views and decent cocktails.\nThey were also very thoughtful and sent a birthday cake up for my birthday along with nightly chocolates or sweets.\nIt is conveniently located a few blocks from the Theater areas and two blocks from Bryant park. PS. Blue bottle coffee in Bryant park has the best coffee in town!\nThere is also a great 99 cent pizza place less than a block away for great \"safety pizza.\"\nThe staff were very friendly and accommodating and there was a Nespresso machine in the room, which was nice and coffee downstairs each morning in the lobby (though it was a bit like warm for my taste).\nOverall, I had a pleasant stay and did not have too many complaints about the hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:33:30.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
