You feel a sense of place, you feel the history. The view of the Eiffel tower from many of its rooms is spectacular. Despite taking photo after photo of the stunning view, when the sun starts to go down you open the window and take even more because the sky's hues of lilac, orange, pink and red are the backdrop for the tower. Truly very special. Speaking of special, the service. The staff is so well trained. They're genuinely warm and hospitable, such a nice touch to be addressed by name by all the staff. You think, 'how do they know who I am?'.\nThe hotel is a gem, I will continue to go back again and again. Thank you dear Valentino and team!\nRoom Tip: Many rooms have view of the Eiffel tower, be sure to ask. All rooms also have soundproof windows!
