Extremely close to the 9/11 Memorial and within walking distance to the financial district. Not a typical Courtyard, as the first floor is fairly small where you check in, so there isn't a lounge on the first floor. It's a few floors up, just ask at the front desk - everyone I came in contact there is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are pretty small, and the desk space was extremely limited in the room I had, so working on my laptop was somewhat challenging. But the bed was so comfortable - had a great night's sleep! I will likely be staying here whenever I'm in town on business.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:39:10.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
