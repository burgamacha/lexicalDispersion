We had three Windows in our room. I loved looking out from the 27th floor and seeing the lights and buildings and even Central Park. The room was clean with a very comfortable bed. Plenty of space for me and my daughter. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was so comforting to come back to after a lot of walking and touring. It is in a great location being very close to Time square and Central Park And BenAsh is across the street with the best cheesecake around!\nRoom Tip: Loved being on the top floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:33:05.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
