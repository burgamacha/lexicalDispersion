We were in the part of the restaurant which had a slightly distant view of the kitchen. It was interesting to watch the chefs at work,\nEven more interesting was the wonderful food they produced. We shared the from the Shoots Stems and Leaves menu;\nOrigin’s salad, pear, gruberg cheese, walnut, celery, bacon bits, croutons, Dijon vinaigrette\nThe Buratta cheese, grilled peaches, prosciutto, lemon olive oil, rocket. Both were superb and imaginatively served.\nFrom the Hunted menu we chose:\nElgin free range chicken, roast baby beets, quinoa, pine nut & sage emulsion,\naubergine cream - there were also crisp, mint leaves - I think a very interesting addition. A joy to eat - and I didn't share one bit!\nSimply roast fish (Cob), wok-fried vegetables, Thai pesto which my husband pronounce as brilliant.\nDeserts, once again shared, were:\nMadagascan chocolate parfait, hazelnut yoghurt, blueberries\nand\nTrio of crème brûlée - chocolate, fruit & spice\nBoth delicious!\nReally good coffee finished our meal!\nLetitia, the restaurant manager and her staff were friendly and attentive.\nAs we spend 5 months of the year in te Cape, we've decided that we must lunch here more oftenand work our way through the menu!\nPLEASE NOTE MY HOTEL RATING IS BASED PURELY ON OUR TIME IN THE ESTAURANT AAND WALKING ROUND THE HOTEL.\nMESSAGE TO TRIPADVISOR WHEN A HOTEL RESTAURANT IS AS GOOD AS ORIGINS - WHY NOT HAVE A WAY TO ALLOW CONTRIBUTORS TO DO A PROPER RESTAURANT REVIEW?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:52:21.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
