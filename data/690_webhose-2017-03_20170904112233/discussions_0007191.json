I had no idea what to expect when I went i went down to breakfast but astonished to find that 2 waitresses had made it into work and were courageously keeping the breakfast buffet going from 6.30 am to 9.30am for the Hotel's 600 or so guests The general manager pitched in and was clearing dishes. The 24 hour coffee and tea service in the lobby was kept going and we all survived . The staff were amazing and the hotel had a great vibe. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay . No complaints whatsoever , only well deserved compliments.
