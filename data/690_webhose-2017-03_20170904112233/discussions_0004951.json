Maybe a little hard to find but once you're there, it's a great place to be! The 'waiting lobby' is unbelievable! Step back thousands of years while enjoying a complimentary glass of wine. Check out the water well around the corner, rock walls, a beautiful piece of history. Very close to the Coliseum, only minutes walking. In the heart of old Rome near everything. Maybe a 15 minute, maximum, walk to the Pantheon. The free breakfast is good and have it with some scrambled eggs. Happy Hour from 6 - 8 has free snacks and cost effective wine. The hotel is a real treasure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:38:20.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
