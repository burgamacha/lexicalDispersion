One, we got 'customer of the day' upgrade (=two breakfasts FOC). Two the room was very nice, the bed perfect, totally silent, a great view over the Thames/London cityscape, the Shard and so on. Three, halfway through breakfast the duty manager Manuel produced a large plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate, a candle, fresh fruit and a centrepiece, gateau etc. The desk staff (Giusy, an Italian) listened. The Novotel's people quietly impressed us with their skill. Well done. They made two new friends.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a Thames view and the highest floor they can do - there are 9.
