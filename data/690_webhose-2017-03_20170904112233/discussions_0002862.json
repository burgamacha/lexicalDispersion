The days we were there we had the pleasure of dealing with Gaelle, Stephanie and Alphonso. They advised us about the cafes nearby, the metro and which were the best ways to see Paris. The kitchen and housekeeping staff were also very helpful.\nThe room was cute and the beds were made very nicely everyday. Reminded me of a B&B's personal touch. Fresh and clean everyday. I like how the room key card doubled as an energy conserver, so when you took it off the slot by the door to leave for the day, it turned off the lights in the room.\nThe breakfast dining area downstairs was warm and inviting everyday that we were there. Fresh hard boiled or scrambled eggs. Many choices of cheeses and breads.\nAlso thin sliced meats, and the butter is really flavorful.\nThe hotel is located on a side street, Rue Brea, which makes it quiet for a peaceful nights sleep, about two minutes walk to the Metro and the tour bus stop is less than a click away. Many tasty cafes and shops all around the hotel. About 15 minutes by Metro to central Paris and tourist spots.\nTo sum it up, an authentic Parisian experience and a great value cost wise.\nRoom Tip: Lower floor if you have heavy luggage.
