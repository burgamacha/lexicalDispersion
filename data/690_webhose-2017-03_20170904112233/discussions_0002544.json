The beds and rooms are very comfortable but definitely on the small side and it is very quiet. The breakfast included has western or Chinese options and the staff are very attentive and sweet. The staff at the front desk are also helpful but their a lack of English can make quite a few questions difficult. Do not expect it to be like big hotels for tour bookings etc. as they don't do this. The entrance isn't hugely obvious either but does have a small sign and lovely blue doors. Because it was winter the surrounding area was quieter, there is a lovely pedestrian street with snack foods one way and restaurants and shops the other (all very upmarket Chinese style) and wonderful to visit day or night. You need to go further away to find western food ie. malls. The subway is close and another very pretty area with a small lake, bars and restaurants also in the area is worth visiting. Also in walking distance to Tiananmen Square etc. I didn't give this Hotel full marks due to difficulty with cabs finding the Hotel (must have address written in Chinese writing) and communication at front desk but I would still fully recommend to anyone that likes to travel a little differently.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:48:17.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
