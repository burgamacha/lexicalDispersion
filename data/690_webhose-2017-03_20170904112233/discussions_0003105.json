Free wi-fi is OK, tends to get a bit slow in the evening when everyone is in, but it works. There are enough bathrooms on each floor and even if the ones near your room happen to be taken, you can always go on the other side of the same floor and find some more. I've stayed there about a dozen times and reception staff are decent but nothing to write home about. Although the decor is somewhat old-fashioned, that's the style they've gone for and the beds and desks are actually quite OK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:33:31.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
