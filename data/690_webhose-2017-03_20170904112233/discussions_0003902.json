They were pleased to be of any service that I required. I felt they were exceptional at every level. I had nothing but an excellent experience there. Moving forward, I will always stay at the Iroquois for any NYC visit I make. I look forward to checking out the special rates and prices that your reception staff told me were available on your website. I understand that weekends are often less expensive and certain months. Thank you for a wonderful stay in your perfectly located hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:09:05.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
