It is also in the hutong area where shops and restaurants are everywhere. Courtyard 7 has its own restaurant which is open from morning to evening and serves buffet breakfast with decent food choices, Western and Asian mix menu. We stayed for 3 days and our room was just amazing. Its a little bit cold outside, temp can drop -1 degrees during mid-March but the room had a heater so it was not a problem for us. It has all the basic necessities, hot and cold shower, TV, Wifi, a small refrigerator, and complimentary coffee/tea and bottled water. The over all atmosphere during our stay was so relaxing and you can feel the history of Chinese tradition in this amazing place. By the way this is our first time here in Beijing and we really enjoyed staying here. We like the stay for a little bit longer but our flight was booked already. Thank you Courtyard 7 and to Ms. Zhang, one of their staff who assisted us thru email with our concerns when we're still the Philippines until the time we came. Until next time Thank you very much!!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:55:33.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
