Rooms are not big but they are well done with high quality fixtures and linens that make the hotel feel more expensive than it is. Complimentary coffee / latte / espresso 24x7 in the lobby is a nice tough, and you also have a coffee machine in the room with good audio system (it is a music themed hotel after all!). Bedding is very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Reception staff were friendly and helpful (spoke English well enough).\nThe hotel also has a small courtyard with a table for you to sit and enjoy the view.\nI would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:11:02.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
