I was very happy to have finally found the Hotel Recamier, which will be the place I stay in the future. The location is fantastic! If you want to be in St. Germain des Près - this is right in the Place St. Suplice in the heart of St. Germain and close to the Jardin du Luxembourg. It's only a few blocks from the St. Suplice métro station on line 4, which is extremely convenient to anyone arriving in Paris either at a train station or airport.\nLike all Paris hotels, the rooms are small, but well designed in optimizing the space and in an elegant design, which makes one feel good. Breakfast is served in a very pleasant room, which has a terrace for good weather (in the courtyard). Small buffet with eggs made to order - perfect for me. The staff from cleaning, check-in and the restaurant are all exceptionally nice and pleasant.\nUnlike so many hotels in Paris, lighting in the room is good so you can actually read and there are plugs for your devices. Wifi in the hotel is free and decent.\nI think they have really optimized the small building that they have to make a really beautiful hotel, which is extremely well managed. I will definitely stay there in the future.\nRoom Tip: My room faced the courtyard, which was completely quiet, but no view.
