You are literally around the corner from the termini. There are loads of restaurants close by and a small mini mart if you need to buy a cold drink etc. The staff are friendly and helpful. The interior of the hotel is very nice and they have a small bar if you want a drink in the evening. We stayed in an executive room which has been refurbished. The rooms are quite small/ compact. They are very clean. The shower room was very nicely refurbished but the shower was tiny! The air conditioning did work very well and our room was very warm but as we were only staying for two nights we put up with it. The breakfast in the morning is excellent. Overall a nice hotel. By the way you do have to pay a â‚¬6 pp per night city tax in cash when you leave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:27:15.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
