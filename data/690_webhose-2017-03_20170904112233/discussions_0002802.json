On arrival we were greeted by the very friendly reception lady who informed us we had been given a free upgrade to a superior room. As others have said the rooms are quite small but that's to be expected in any city. The room was by no means uncomfortably small, and the space was used very well with wardrobes either side of the bed, a tv on the opposite wall, a desk, suitcase rack, and a cupboard containing a fridge and the tea/coffee facilities on top. The bathroom was also quite small but everything was in there you could need including complimentary products and proper sized bath towels that actually covered you! There were also a pair of slippers each. The bed was incredibly comfortable. There is only one lift that can be a bit slow in the morning but it's easy just to walk down the stairs. The breakfast is continental and contained all the usual fayre. Pastries, bread, cereal, ham,cheese,yogurt fruit etc. The man working in the breakfast room was delightful. Always happy and accommodating. The position of the hotel was excellent. Far enough from the city to feel safe but on a road with plenty of restaurants and bars and excellent metro links into the city in about 25 to 30 mins. I would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again if we ever go back to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:08:13.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
