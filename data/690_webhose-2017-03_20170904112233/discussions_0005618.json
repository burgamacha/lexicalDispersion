The rooms are beautiful with antique (or at least antique-style), eclectic but classy furniture. They're also decked out with wonderful CO Bigelow products in the bathroom, location-relevant books, and a great mini-bar. The beds are high, big, and comfortable. There's an Intelligentsia coffee kiosk in the lobby for coffee & snacks that doubles as a bar. Stay in an inside room if you can - it's so quiet, you can't believe you're in the city. Also, you're only one block from the High Line park! Great location and a wonderful, romantic hotel.\nRoom Tip: Try to get an interior room (all suites are interior) if you can - so quiet and lovely.
