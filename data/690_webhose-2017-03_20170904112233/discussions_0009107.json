We booked and paid in advance but asked to upgrade when we got there and they accommodated us in a deluxe room for a very reasonable and discounted additional fee. The staff were very friendly and always willing to help and go the extra mile. The room was reasonably sized and we were happy we upgraded. The in-room amenities are very nice, including the ipad guest information book with the ability to make requests for service from your room.\nThe only down side is the location. It is just about as far as it can be from two different metro stops. It is also a little farther west than we wanted and it took a considerable amount of time to get across town. If you are going to the tourist site on the river it's not too bad but be prepared for a bit of a walk and ride on the tube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:15:48.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
