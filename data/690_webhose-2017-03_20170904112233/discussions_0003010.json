Formerly a dowdy Best Western, it has been upgraded by a family who have given it a warm atmosphere with very friendly and helpful staff and a small bar-restaurant serving a good breakfast buffet and Indian food and good wines in the evening. Their pricing is most reasonable considering the fantastic location and my corner room was a good size compared to many central London rooms.\nRoom Tip: Try to get a good size corner room noting Shaftesbury outlook is noisier than Dean.
