I stayed here with my girlfriend for a weekend and it was perfect. 4 minutes walk from Corentin Cariou metro station (line 7). There are also two supermarkets. The room was not too big, but it was very comfy and clean. The hotel staff was very kind. The hotel restaurant is worth a try, it gives you a good buffet breakfast, but don't expect too much even if I guess this is the best you can get from a Paris Hotel. Try also the restaurant in the evening, it offers you some interesting dishes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:22:48.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
