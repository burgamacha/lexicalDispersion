Beautiful, spotless hotel with a seamless blend of modern decor with marble floors and stairs. Generous, well furnished rooms with super-King beds. Sumptuous breakfasts, and superb dining. Extremely friendly and helpful staff who seemed to take pleasure in helping with any query or request. Our four rooms were all together as requested.\nThe hotel is also very well positioned with all the main tourist attractions in Rome within walking distance or a short ride. Restaurants and bars everywhere. I hadn't realised just how beautiful central Rome is and although busy the traffic is nothing compared with London.\nThoroughly recommend both Rome and the Artemide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T11:08:29.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
