First, I want to compliment the staff as I found them incredibly warm and helpful and I was very grateful when they suggested getting the 65 bus to the Gare du Nord for our Eurostar train to London as it cut out all the schlepping around in the metro for what was a comfortable, direct 15 minute bus ride. We decided to skip breakfast and instead had baguettes with delicious creamy butter and croissants in a cafe just a spit away where everything is baked on the premises. It was recommended by the staff so they could have kept that one under their hats to try and entice us to their breakfasts but they didn't! My partner and I slept like logs and as ex BBC journalists, we were delighted to see there was BBC World News on the tv in our room. I liked the fact that there was a bath as well as a shower which was so welcome after walking in the cold all day and the room wasn't small at all by Paris standards. The maids tidied our room up beautifully every day. Thank you very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:29:19.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
