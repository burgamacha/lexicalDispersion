Which is a good thing in February. The staff was very helpful and gave good advice/help. Location is perfect - quiet area with several good restaurants nearby. Especially a small place specialising in \"hot pot\" and the best beer ever! It is also close to the subway - by far the best transportation in Beijing. Super hotel and location for us - 2 children and 2 adults.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:14:45.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
