The staff were generally nice and the room was comfortable. What you would expect for a budget hotel. Lovely Shower. I do have one complaint though..I stayed here for 3 nights and everyday someone would knock on the door and attempt to walk into the room. This was not housekeeping as it was later in the day when the housekeeping was finished. Every time it happened we would shout hello and the person would be gone before we had time to get to the door to ask what they were looking for. I asked at the desk on the second day and they advised it was probably someone dropping off bottled water. I don't believe this to be true as there was never bottled water left in our room during our stay. It didn't affect our stay much but it just worried me as if we were not in the room when they came they would have just walked in. Every time the door was opened but the person would disappear when we would shout out to see who it was.
