By no frills I mean that this is a B&B hotel, as they order in breakfast for you, and there is no bar area, restaurant or any real public areas. The plus to my mind is that the rooms are very comfortable and nicely equipped, including a very small kitchenette area, and they are considerably nicer than say, Premier Inn or Holiday Inn which are generally the same price level. And with all the local restaurants, theatres and easy access to Oxford Street the location provides all your needs.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:58:21.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
