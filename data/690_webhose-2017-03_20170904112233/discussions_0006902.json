When we checked out the following day, we left our luggage in the room and they put it in the storage locker for us. By the end of the day, when we came to pick up our luggage, my son realized that he had forgotten his cell phone in the room that morning but someone else had checked in since. Both Dave (the bell boy) and David at the front desk told me not to worry that they would be on top of it. After I got home, I realized we were short 1 luggage (which was our fault as my son who went to collect our luggage hadn't recognized his brother's luggage and just left it there!). Again, Dave to the rescue. He reassured us that the bag was still in the locker and not to worry.\nA lot of events happened for a one night stay but it was smooth sailing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:12:40.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
