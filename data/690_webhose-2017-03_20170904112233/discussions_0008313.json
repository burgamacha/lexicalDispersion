It is situated at the heart of lower Marais area, next to the BHV which is excellent for those who love Marais. It is a very small hotel with \"smallish\" rooms but then again for Marais and Paris hotels the room may considered quite large. The decoration of the room is modern french and offers all amenities expected (hair dryer, towel drying hanger, a modern cabin shower). What really impressed me is the cleanliness and good service which is extremely difficult to find in Paris unless you go to a 5-star hotel. The room was serviced daily and the cleaning staff was very discreet to clean it when I was out, even at the quite odd times I left the \"please make up my room\" tag. It has nice light in the morning also something important for the Marais area, where even 4star hotels offer below average room quality. The hotel has a very nice small bar where they serve very good cocktails. The reception staff was always available, very polite and ready to help. If someone loves to stay at Marais (like I do for many years) this is an excellent choice and I dare say for it's price and location maybe the best choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:03:38.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
