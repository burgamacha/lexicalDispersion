We were warmly greeted by the friendly, lovely ladies at the front desk. They gladly assisted us with our luggage, reserved tours, recommended shopping destinations for my teenaged nieces, recommended family friendly restaurants, and arranged transportation to the airport. Further, the rooms and hotel are incredibly clean, showers are wonderful and the beds are simply dreamy. The private spa is perfect environment in which to unwind and relax after a long day of touring the museums and monuments throughout Paris. This was my 3rd stay at the DaVinci, and we are already looking forward to our next visit. If it were possible give more than 5 stars, I certainly would do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:22:30.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
