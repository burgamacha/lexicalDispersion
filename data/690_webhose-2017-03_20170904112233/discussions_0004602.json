The Roger was perfect. Great location, yet unlike so many New York Hotels I have stayed in the past I found it quiet and a haven from the bustle outside. It may be the City that never sleeps, but certainly I would like to have the chance, the Roger gave me that.\nIn truth I did not use that many of the facilities, but the room was great and all the staff that I came into contact with were excellent. Breakfast was great for me.\nI hope to stay here again soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:33:31.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
