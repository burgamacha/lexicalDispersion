Fantastic location within walking distance to everything. Eiffel Tower about 5 mins away, lots of cafes, patisserie, mini deli, tourist shops, cross the bridge for the metro and easy walk to the city, hop on and off tour bus easy access at base of Eiffel Tower. Rooms are big enough for our luggage, if you need an iron/board just ask, bathrooms are tiny but think that's normal for Europe and shower is inside bath so may be hard for elderly to get in and out of, bed is firm but comfy, hotel is very clean and cosy. The staff speak English, all helpful and all friendly. However a big shout out to Agatt/Agarta who showed us to our room, made our drinks and then gave me a gorgeous rose for International Woman's Day, she is happy, helpful and incredibly sweet and without a doubt one of the best faces to represent a hotel when guests arrive, nothing is too hard for this young lady and you feel welcome instantly. We just loved this hotel and would absolutely come back here, we would highly recommend it to everyone, thanks guys we hope to see you next time in the spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:52:43.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
