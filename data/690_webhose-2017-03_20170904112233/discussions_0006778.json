The rooms are small but clean and have everything you might need: Hangers, shower, private bath (in some rooms, like mine), desk, and TV. The bed is very hard and is just a mattress in a wooden frame. I didn't sleep well (not just because the fire alarm went off at 4am by accident and couldn't fall asleep after), but it was easy to get to/from work during terrible weather. Restaurant inside is delicious but pricey. They were also closed for breakfast in the AM, which I didn't expect, so I got a (fantastic) croissant and (terrible) coffee in the bar area the next morning.\nI also got a bit of pushback when checking out because I had booked my room on Travelocity (though the woman at the desk said I used Expedia). She said she couldn't give me an itemized bill because of it, a problem I have never had before. This expense report is now going to be a pain because they were apparently unhappy I used a third-party to book my room. That's a new one for me. I also mentioned that one of my lamps wasn't working and she nodded, but didn't appear to make any note of it. Just a heads up if you're staying in room 1504 and planning to read in bed!\nIf you're a tourist who will be exhausted by the end of the day and can sleep on very hard mattresses, you'll like it, but I don't think I'll pick this spot again.\nRoom Tip: Ask for higher floor and book room w/private bathroom/WC See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:47:32.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
