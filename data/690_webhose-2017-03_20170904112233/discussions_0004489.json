How is that even possible. However, the overwhelmingly positive reviews convinced me to give it a shot and I'm glad I did.\nI arrived at around 9:30am having just come from New York and they had a room ready for me. +1 right out of the gate. I got to my room, a Standard Double, and it looked exactly like the pictures on the website. There was even a small balcony overlooking the street. The room was small, but very comfortable for one (or even two) people as long as you don't have a ton of luggage. There is no closet, just a small hang bar with 6 hangers. The bathroom is spacious and the shower was very nice. Everything was very clean. The room also has a complementary \"minibar\" with some soft drinks which is replenished daily.\nThe rate I chose included breakfast, which had a very good selection. On the weekend, they could be a bit behind clearing tables, but it was never more than a couple of minutes. There are also complementary snacks available from 1pm to 1am, which was great for when you got back from a long day but weren't quite ready for dinner yet.\nDepending on what your plans are in the city, the neighborhood could be a bit of a drawback. It's extremely safe and situated very nicely for shopping at Galeries Lafayette or high street shops on the Champs Elysees/Rue Saint Honore. However, it's pretty much devoid of nightlife if that's what you're looking for. Even on Saturday night, I asked the desk if there were any bars within ~20min walking and the latest one was really a restaurant that closed at 11pm. Sunday night it was quite difficult to find a restaurant open for dinner at all. I wouldn't really consider this too much of a drawback though because there are a ton of metro lines available within a 5-10min walk and uber was very easy to use within the city.\nOverall, I would happily stay at this property or one of the other Astotels next time I'm in Paris. After my stay, I switched to a business hotel which was 4x the price and honestly, I thought the Augustin was nicer.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:05:10.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
