Outstanding location - many major subway lines within 1 or 2 blocks. 5 to 10 minute walk to all Broadway area theatres. Times Square at end of block. 20 th floor, Nice size room for NYC, King bed, comfy, big screen TV, Microwave, Keurig- with supplied k cups, small frig. Armoire for clothes a little tight but adequate. Had buffet breakfast & 1 dinner at Paul's hotel lobby- nice. For breakfast, Only buffet is available Lobby is on 4th floor. Our room, partial view of Times Square facing 42 nd, no street noise, only occasional sirens. Not sure on parking as we took train.\nVery clean, extra blankets requested n delivered immediately. While water pressure was great, hot water ran out, maintenance did respond, but probably a high demand\nat that time. Elevators very responsive. All staff friendly and attentive, Great stay. Small basic pantry store on site, but for goodies, soda and snacks- a full service market including salad bar Whole Food is recommended a half block away on 6 th Ave. A few Hiltons in area, so be sure of correct address. Grand Central terminal, market and food court down the street, a few blocks. Hotel is highly recommended.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:32:04.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
