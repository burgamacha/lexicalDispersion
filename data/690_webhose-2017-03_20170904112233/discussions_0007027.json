I am deployed overseas and haven't seen them in five months, so we wanted a convenient and easy stay in the city with a large room and kid-friendly. This trip completely delivered. Was just an amazing 4 days. Rome Glam and the staff were a huge part of that experience.\nThe room was great, a true king-sized bed and nice setup. We had a convenient location on fourth floor allowing quick access to the dining area and roof. The overall feel of the hotel allowed us to hang out and get slow starts to the day or grab a drink at night after a day of exploring Rome.\nHotel was nice, but the staff really made the difference. They were so friendly and helpful. We were nervous about bring our son, but he was kind of star of the trip. The breakfast staff (sorry for not getting your names!) were especially great. Every morning we would bring him down and grab a full breakfast (which is legit, would pay full-price and be satisfied). Luke got a child seat and lots of attention. Just very friendly people. My wife and I felt like we were at home.\nLocation was great. Rome is a very walkable city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:35:04.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
