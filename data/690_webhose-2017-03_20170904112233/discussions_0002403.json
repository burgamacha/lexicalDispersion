You can easily walk to the Louvre and Notre Dame. You can get to many of the subway lines within a 10 minute walk, one of them within a 2 minute walk. There are good restaurants nearby.\nThe room itself was quite small, but that's to be expected given the location. The walls also transmitted a decent amount of noise from other rooms, but that ended up not being a big deal because our neighbors weren't too noisy during sleeping hours.\nThe front desk were friendly and helpful as well.\nOverall, a great value for this location, and if you don't mind the small rooms or the possibility of some noise from other rooms, I would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:15:17.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
