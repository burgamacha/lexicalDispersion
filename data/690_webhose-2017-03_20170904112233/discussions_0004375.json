If what you want is affordable comfort in the heart of Manhattan then the Holiday Inn Express in 39th Street is an excellent choice.\nThe street itself is a bit tired but the hotel, which is being gradually refurbished, offers a decent breakfast, endlessly helpful reception staff, free Wi-Fi and lovely comfortable beds. The staff overseeing the breakfast buffet were patient and ensured fresh food was available throughout. We never had to wait for a table. Whenever we returned to the room after sightseeing, it had been cleaned and soaps, coffee etc replenished. The housekeeping staff could not be faulted. The refreshments that are permanently available in the foyer were welcome.\nThe hotel is ideally situated for all we wanted to do. It is close to the theatres and we had a ten minute walk to see a fabulous production of The Lion King. A short stroll to the west will take you to the piers where you can take the landmark cruise to catch the main sights and have a potted history of New York. Trips to the Top of the Rock and The Empire State Building were worth the short taxi rides. Penn Station is conveniently close so we took the subway to the 9/11 Tribute which was as informative as it was moving.\nI know that should we ever visit Manhattan again we will book the Holiday Inn Express, even if I could afford one of the swankier places around Central Park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:42:03.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
