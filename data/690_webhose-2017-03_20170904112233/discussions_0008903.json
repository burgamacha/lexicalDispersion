It is in a great location ... close to Earl's Court tube station. Since we were only there 2 nights this time we did not utilize the kitchenette as much but very nice to have it. We also opted for a smaller room this time as we were just doing a quick sprint through London and spent very little time in our room. If you are in the room more consider the Superior room just for the larger bathroom. The bathroom set up in the smaller room was awkward with the mirror on the wall behind the sink.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:10:35.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
