I had booked a junior suite but upon check in Mr. Tezza the very courteous Front Desk Supervisor offered me a Deluxe Suite for a nominal additional charge. He then made sure I had the best available room given that this was my first time staying at a Peninsula Hotel and personally escorted me to my room and showed me its many features. The room (a massive two-room suite with a guest bath and a luxurious master bath) was absolutely stunning in every way. I enjoyed drinks in the lounge and in the rooftop bar and had lunch on the Terrace. The food was delicious and elegantly presented. The concierge recommended an excellent bistro for dinner and a spectacular Michelin starred restaurant for lunch. Her choices were exactly what I wanted in terms of ambience and cuisine. In short, this hotel and its staff are excellent, elegant and luxurious yet never stuffy. I'll never stay anywhere else in Paris and I look forward to trying other Peninsula properties.\nRoom Tip: 4th floor rooms have small balconies See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:35:28.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
