However, the staff was unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful. In fact, when our taxi was late, the GM had the hotel van run us to our event, and he himself came to pick us back up at the end!\nThe views are lovely, the pool area delightful, and the food was pretty good, with the breakfast buffet a standout.\nMy room was very clean, though the lake flies are inescapable; beds and linens were very comfortable, and the AC worked like a charm. Overall a very nice place to stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:53:55.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
