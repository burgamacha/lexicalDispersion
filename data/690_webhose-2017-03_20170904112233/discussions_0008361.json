When we arrived there was a huge crowd around due to some sort of market but when we were in the room you would've had no clue!\nThe room was small but more an adequate. No kettle facilities but free tea and coffee facilities were available. The bed was more than big enough for myself and my husband, who is 6ft 2. The light features and tv were easy to use. Room itself was kept very clean.\nLocation is very handy, easy to get to from Paddington very close to Aldgate East underground station within a 5 minute walk. Make sure you take the right exit (exit to whitechapel gallery) and it makes it much easier to find.\nI would say this area is better for couples/friends not so much children as there is a lot of bars within a short distance. Would definitely go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:25:46.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
