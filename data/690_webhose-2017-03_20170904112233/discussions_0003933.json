It's only 4 blocks from my son's apartment on 96th and Madison. It also looked nice in the pictures and got good reviews online. I was pleasantly surprised by its charm and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Another nice surprise was the large room on the mezzanine where complimentary tea and coffee are available 24 hours a day. The first morning, there were even New York Times available. My room on the 7th floor was nice and quiet. It's hard to control the amount of heat since the radiator dial takes a long time to turn and sometimes is too hot to turn. However, the windows open (a rarity in most hotels) so I was able to keep the room as cool as I like it at night. The room is very nicely appointed and the bathroom is spotless. They should tell you that the shower knob in 701 was installed backwards. To get hot water, turn the knob only 1/4 turn counter-clockwise. Then continue turning counter-clockwise to get cooler water. I thought there was no hot water and called down to the desk, who sent someone up. There's plenty of hot water; you just have to know how to work it. The bed is extremely comfortable with wonderful sheets. Be warned: the rooms are pretty small. For one person, it's perfect, but if there are two people and more than a small bag each, it could be a squeeze.\nRoom Tip: The higher floors are quieter. Just ask for a quiet room.
