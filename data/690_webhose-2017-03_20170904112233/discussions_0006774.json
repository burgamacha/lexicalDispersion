It's located right next to the Borough Underground station which is super convenient for getting places in the city. The staff were super friendly and attentive and made suggestions on places to visit while staying in London. The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were very clean. This property is a gem and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay. I will stay here again when I return to London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:40:23.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
