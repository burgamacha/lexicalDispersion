I am so glad I decided on the River Palace Hotel. My friend & I stayed 2 nights before leaving for a cruise. Because I had difficulty with the hotel's website when trying to make the reservation about 2 months prior to our stay, I made the reservation through a 3rd party site. About 2 weeks prior to our trip I contacted the hotel to confirm that we would have the requested superior twin room ( a little larger with 2 separate beds). The confirmation from the hotel was quick & cordial. After a cancelled flight & a delayed arrival, we got to the hotel around 9:30 pm. The small sandwiches, cheeses, & other choices from Happy Hour were our dinner after being up for over 24 hours, & we were glad to have it. The bartender makes a great cosmopolitan. From comments, we expected the room to be small. Even though it was not large, it was adequate for our needs with a closet, a small writing desk, small refrigerator, & 2 twin beds pushed together. The room was nicely appointed, very clean, & very quiet - so quiet that we unintentionally slept through breakfast on the last day, which was sad because we thought the breakfast was great. Breakfast is served in a beautiful dining room with food lined up on 2 sides & beverages on another. We were very pleased with the food choices & the taste. The hotel is very conveniently located for shopping & within walking distance of several tourist destinations. The staff was friendly & professional. I am glad I chose this hotel & would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:23.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
