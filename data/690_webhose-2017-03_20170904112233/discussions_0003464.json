The hotel is clean and convenient and the rooms well kept and appointed, but the staff is what adds the exclamation point to this property. We arrange for 8-10 for this weekend, and the hotel arrangements in past were a source of extraordinary time and aggravation. The staff at this hotel understood the shared experience as a family we were looking for, and made arrangements that enhanced our experience...and all it took was listening to what was important...being together! Each interaction with them was pleasant and they worked diligently to make my experience as the person planning easy and not a miserable chore! Just AWESOME! This is our second year here and we've also stayed in between for a night here or there for business. I have even begun recommending and using Residence Inn's in other cities instead of other Marriott brands because of my experience here. I have found other experiences at Residence Inn's to be similar, but this property also is really nice and really convenient to Midtown Manhattan activities.\nIf I could give 6 or 7 stars I would!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:02:48.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
