We arrived at the hotel around 11:00 a.m. and hoped, but did not expect, our room would be ready. It was not, but the outstanding gentlemen at the front desk immediately took our luggage from us and offered coffee and refreshments. Within 30 minutes we were being escorted to our room, our luggage had already been delivered.\nOur room was a nice size. It was not large, but we did not feel cramped. There was plenty of space to store all of our items (my daughter and I don't travel lightly) and the bathroom was very spacious. The view from our window was nothing great, but we weren\"t in Paris to look out the window so it really didn't matter. The elevator was typical of a small boutique hotel, meaning it was small and cramped. Not being fans of small spaces we used the stairs instead.\nThe hotel is located on a small side street. It was active during the day and evening, but we had no noise issues at night. It is approximately 1 block from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs de Elysee. There are many cafes and eateries as well as a small market and a pharmacy close by. The activities and restaurants we were interested in were not close to the hotel, but Paris is a very walkable city and there are plenty of taxis and Uber drivers more than willing to assist us when the weather got nasty or our feet got tired.\nThe beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets. The towels in the bathroom were large and soft. The housekeeping staff was efficient and non intrusive. I also felt that the mini bar was reasonably priced, so we didn't feel guilty about grabbing a bottle of water or soda.\nThere are two VERY SMALL items that I could comment negatively on. There were no washcloths in the bathroom, and the supplied shampoo was a bit harsh for my hair. We never requested washcloths, because it wasn't that important, and we could have easily remedied the shampoo issue at the pharmacy down the street. Again, these were the only issues we had, everything else was exceptional.\nI would absolutely recommend the Hotel Balmoral to everyone. The staff, location and room were all exceptional. I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:35:29.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
