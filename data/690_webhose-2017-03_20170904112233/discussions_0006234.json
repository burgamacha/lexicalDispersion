Our room and en-suite were great. Lolabar is a must-visit for gin lovers and anyone who appreciates the beautiful creations of a talented cocktail mixologist.\nPerhaps visiting on a Sunday night impacted the atmosphere, but Hotel Banke lacked any during our visit, which was disappointing as it was so apparent. My only other negative would be that our room keys did not work on our final day as there had been an issue with our late check-out (which had been confirmed). It was not a problem for the front desk to reactive the keys, but it would have saved us the journey and inconvenience if we had not been locked out in the first place.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Banke Hotel. The location was great for us, as it is not far from the Eurostar terminal and is a convenient location to explore the Opera district. I only wish I could have experienced a longer stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:54:57.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
