It's in a perfect position for exploring convent garden and surrounding areas by foot. The room was small but had all we needed, especially when I asked for a kettle!\nWhat I liked the most is that all the staff were friendly and helpful even if they all looked like they must be models in their spare time! Nothing was too much trouble.\nWould love to return if the price was right. Thanks especially to Isabelle on reception and the brilliant and very good looking door staff :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:20:33.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
