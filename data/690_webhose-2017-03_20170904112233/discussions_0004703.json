I arrived late due to a delayed flight, but the check in process could not have been any smoother. To top it off, the gentlemen assiting me gave me an upgrade because he said I looked exhausted - which I was! The room was on the small side, but you're smack in the middle of NYC so what would you expect, right?!\nThe view of the room was amazing - facing downtown over looking the Highline. Bed was extreemly comfortable and the food from room service was great. In the morning, as I was walking out, they offered to grab me a taxi which was real nice - a guy fresh out of Miami isnt really the best at this so I was grateful.\nOverall this was a great experience and would most definitely stay here again, no questions asked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:06:35.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
