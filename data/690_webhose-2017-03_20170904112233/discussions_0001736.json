Great space with ample closets. Full disclosure - We had the plumber fix our toilet once when it wouldn't stop running. We never got the bathroom outlet to work, but there were plenty other working outlets available so we didn't report it. We stayed 4 nights and were very comfortable.\nThe Hotel: CHARMING. We loved ending each evening with a nightcap from the stables bar. Plenty of rooms off the lobby to sit in, each with their unique characteristics. We enjoyed a proper afternoon tea - the chef was very accommodating with my food allergies, even though we did not make advance arrangements. The building has a great history. I recommend allowing them to give you the lobby tour upon arrival.\nThe Staff: Exceeded expectation. Peggy, Fran, Leo, the incredible week-day doorman (who I unfortunately did not ask his name), and the bar/restaurant staff made our visit memorable. Very accommodating and EXTREMELY thoughtful. Peggy was our shining star - she sent a treat with a handwritten note to our room, sending good wishes for an event we were attending while in town.\nOverview: STAY HERE! My husband asked if we could move in. We've never been treated so well at a hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:02:01.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
