And this is our review about Park Plaza Wangfujing.\nMy husband and I decided to stay at this hotel. We didn't expect much but what we've got is beyond our mind. The hotel decorated well and comfortable.\nVery close to Subway Station & many restaurant nearby. Dadong famous roast duck restaurant just couple minutes walk. Starbucks just only 1min walk, right in front of the hotel. The shuttle bus to and from the airport just stops near this hotel.\nThe receptionist (Miranda) can speak english very well. And help us everything what we needed.\nThe room itself was very comfy, clean, and has a nice decoration. We love the design.\nOverall we really satisfied with their service and accomodation during our stay. We definitely like to stay here again if we visit Beijing someday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:50:04.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
