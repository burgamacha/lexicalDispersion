Lots of times the free WIFI and free breakfast hotels are 3 stars or less. Well, we found this 4 star with top notch rooms, staff and atmosphere including the fabulous bagels, muffins, fruit and coffee. The hotel is in the middle of it all but is nice and quiet, beautiful and friendly. Within minutes we could be downstairs and out the door to the show from the premier viewed 10th story room. Will stay at this little home away from home again and recommend it to all of our friends. Thanks to the personable and amazing staff, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:50:14.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
