The front desk check-in process was smooth and had no issues. Security was tight and felt very secure while at the hotel. There was a reception of some type that shut down the street and areas of the hotel but the staff was quick to communicate what was coming.\nLocation is not bad and within a short cab trip from most tourist stops. It was around $20 Euros to Catacombes, and $15 to Louvre, and $10 to Eifel. Not an easy spot to jump on and off of the subway system. Breakfast was $30 to $50 but it did look good if you wanted to spend the money.\nAs you come out of the hotel when you turn left it is around 2 blocks down to the Champ Elysees and there are many nice restaurants to choose from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:52:50.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
