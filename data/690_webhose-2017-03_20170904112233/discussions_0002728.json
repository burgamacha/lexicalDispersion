The room was neat and compact with ensuite bathroom to match. Beds where large and comfortable.\nWe where there for 3 nights over the weekend and unfortunately found the rest of the interaction with the front desk to be very inconsistent. There also seemed to be a complete disconnect with the restaurant / bar located on the ground floor off the lobby. It seemed that it was almost totally separated from the hotel.\nValue for money its a great option that delivers a perfect place to stay in the area. If you're looking for great room service and attentive staff then this is not the space for you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:39:35.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
