I came in the day after last week's snowstorm and was really happy that I was able to check in 2 hours early. My room was small but just right and comfortable for me. It was on the corner of the 20th floor and I had a nice view. The bathroom hasn't been upgraded yet but it was clean so that was enough for me. However the bathroom window is incredibly drafty and until I thought to close the bathroom door, my room was pretty chilly. Also the hallways could stand to be a little better lit/brightened up.\nThe only thing that was a real issue was around 8:30 in the morning, I was laying in bed and suddenly someone used a key to open my door. Fortunately I had the bar lock engaged so they couldn't open it all the way and when I said something, they quickly slammed the door shut. I didn't get a good look at them but I am pretty sure it wasn't housekeeping (the color of their shirt didn't look like housekeeping and they didn't knock first). I had both my room keys so I am not sure how they got a key. Kind of concerning - especially if the bar lock wasn't engaged, I can't help but wonder if the person would of came in my room?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:42:27.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
