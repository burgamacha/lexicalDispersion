We had no expectations other than it was near the hospital. The hotel turned out to be really good and perfectly located in the Murray Hill area. The room was large, it had a good desk/work area, a small fully appliance kitchen, and a nice clean bathroom. There was a dunkin doughnuts right next door which was perfect for me since I love their coffee and first thing in the morning! There was coffee in the room but I am a dunkin gal!! to make the experience even better they have a \"happy hour\" in the lobby from 5 to 6 and offer red and white wine :-) The staff was great and we will stay there next time we are in NYC.\nRoom Tip: we could have asked for a room with a view of the Chrysler building but did not know!
