I ended up booking this place for New Years eve and it was great! Location, staff and PRICE were all worth it! Parking is ehhhh we used a parking structure they recommended which is another story lol and the restaurant they have is kinda pricey $50 for pizza and 2 slices of cake $50!!! but otherwise everything else was great. The first person who helped us was the bell boy? Security maybe? Not sure but he was s awesome! Also funny and sweet, he hooked us up with a prking spot right up front for the night we got there and warned us that because of street closures for the new years celebration to not forget to move the car by like 7 the next morning. (We then moved it to the parking structure recommended by the hotel) The lady at check in was so nice and friendly answered my every question. The room seemed small but we had a king bed, tv and all the basics and it was super clean (great since my bf is very picky) plus the bathroom was a good size. When i booked the room it was just a \"city view\" turns out we had a view of the ball. Amaaaazing I know! Long story short we ended up watching the ball drop from the room which we had no problem doing. All in all would visit again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:24:03.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
