It is a friendly, clean and quiet hotel with a good location for both attending the congress centre as well as to visit the sights in Paris as it is a throw away from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs d'Elysees.\nGladly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues.\nRoom Tip: Higher floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:51:15.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
