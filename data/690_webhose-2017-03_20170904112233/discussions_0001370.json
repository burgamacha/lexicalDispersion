I was spending the weekend in NYC and the room was very spacious. The bathroom is quite big and both very clean and well maintained. The Club Rooms get a separate elevator, access to free refillable water. Each floor also has laundry machines. The fitness room is very spacious and provides different machines to cater to everyone's needs. The restaurant at the 20th floor provides some amazing views of NYC.\nThe hotel is located in Manhattan close to many attractions, restaurants and shops. Just as you leave the hotel you can see One World Trade Center, the site of the 9/11 memorial. It take less than 5 minutes to get to the North and South pools and the Oculus which also features a number of shops. Battery Park is also a short walk away with some amazing views of the Statue of Liberty and the city. The hotel is also close to various subway stations that provide access to the main tourist spots like Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, the museums and Brooklyn.\nThe staff is very polite and were very helpful in getting directions. I can't fault this hotel, it is in an ideal location and allows you to experience all the wonders of NYC.\nRoom Tip: Best views are the higher floors See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:33:46.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
