Staff was very friendly and showed me to my friend's room with no problems. Although there were renovations going on, and many things were temporarily shifted, there was no loud noise. All the workers were very quiet and discreet. The room I stayed in was amazing. The bathroom was very modernized & the beds were so comfy. However, the shower doesn't have a shower door. It only has a tall glass door that covers the half of the shower. The best part of it all was the amazing view of the Empire State Building. Although the hotel was on a busy street, the rooms were very quiet. I didn't have any issues while staying there. Would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:34:04.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
