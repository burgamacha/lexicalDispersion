There is also a nearby metro station.\nThe staff were very welcoming with complementary tea and coffee throughout our stay.\nWe received a survey of our requirements before we arrived, this enabled the hotel to provide us with information for recommended restaurants etc before our visit.\nThe room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was plenty of hot water and the WIFI was good. I'd recommend this hotel to friends and family. The only downside was that there was not any tea and coffee making facilities in the room.\nRoom Tip: Take your own kettle if you want to make your own hot drinks in the room.
