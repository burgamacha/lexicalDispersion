Big toilet. Really great location, nice staff always polite and helpful. Parking space available. The negative points were the water pipe noise in our room in the mornings and very much disappointed with breakfast. Hot options were kept in the dish with light candles which would never keep it hot and very poor options on the buffet in a 4* hotel. Not having breakfast at the hotel I would definitely stay there on my next time in Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:32:31.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
