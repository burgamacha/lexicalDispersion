We knew we weren't getting fancy, but boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The tiny micro lobby shouldn't turn you off... the hotel begins on the 12th floor with the public space. As we made our way to our room- 2 queens and a small sofa bed - a housekeeper greeted us. She came to our door five minutes later with a stack of extra towels and a bag filled with extra soaps and toiletries. Nice service that she noticed and jumped right in to make sure our room was stocked! The room was very big for city standards, and the mattresses super comfortable after schlepping around the city all day.\nMy only disappointment was the breakfast area which is not a restaurant. It is set up like a fast food, quick order counter, but it is not quick or fast. Packaged cereal milk and a banana still took more than five minutes to be pulled together.\nOther than that, the location is great and was a perfect home base for our family weekend. Would stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:36:33.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
