The map was actually of no use and feel the hotel need to address this and give better directions - the car park is actually only a 5 min walk away - underneath a shopping Centre - but is not on the main road or sign posted - we were stressed to say the least on arrival ! However - the room was delightful (family room for ourselves and 10 year old daughter) - everything we needed was there. Beds were comfortable - room was spotlessly clean - I was cold and had to ask for another quilt which was brought up immediately - but being cold is just me and not a criticism of the hotel. We met my son who lives nearby for dinner and ate in the Marco Pierre White restaurant which was Devine - the food and service were faultless - as was breakfast on both mornings - no complaints whatsoever apart from the car park fiasco - we would stay there again (now we know where to park the car) the reception and bar area is relaxing and cosy - it really was a lovely hotel to stay in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:34:31.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
