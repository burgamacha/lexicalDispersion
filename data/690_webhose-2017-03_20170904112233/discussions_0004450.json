Especially with a family of 6 and a nanny it's hard to justify, so all of our attention went to airbnb. The only issue was that our kids would need to start off the day with breakfast.\nThis hotel had it all, a great alternative to airbnb as the suites offered a two floor layout which was perfect for the 7 of us. The bathrooms were huge and each suite had 2 toilets.\nThe staff provided incredible service the whole time we were there. Special accommodations at breakfast, assisting with arrangements for transportation and activities, even researching where we could get large macaroons on a Sunday.\nThe only sticking point that I will echo from other reviews is the fact that this hotel should in no way be marketed as a 5* hotel. In the past year I've stayed at half a dozen 5* hotels and this one lacks the finer qualities. I've checked out the mandarin oriental, the George v, even the Marriott on the champs elysee, and it is impossible to put this hotel in the same league.\nHaving said that, other critiques I have seen reviewed are somewhat unfounded. The subway noise was unnoticeable to us until our 6th night. The distance from the metro could not have been shorter if it were in the lobby. The beds were some of the most comfortable I've slept in in any hotel.\nAll and all we will be back to stay at the best western premier opera liege for our next visit to Paris. Which is something I would have never said of any other best western I've visited in my life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:41:11.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
