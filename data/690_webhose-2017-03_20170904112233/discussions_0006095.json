We paid 90 a night for 2 doubles in a room room (extremely cheap particularly when there is 3/4 people). Rooms were clean and a decent size, and we were lucky enough to have a street view which was a lovely touch!\nWould absolutely recommend for a budget trip looking for a good central hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:10:12.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
