It was so nice to avoid the big chain hotels and stay in a historic part of Beijing with a great location. It is in Hutong but walkable to many shops and restaurants. We stayed in the family room with our 3 kids and it was beautifully decorated. The staff was incredible - even running out and getting a birthday cake for our daughter while we ate dinner (at no cost)! We had dinner in the stylish restaurant 2x and the food was very good. Breakfasts were also lovely - and you can order eggs as you like. We would stay again here. It was cold when we were there but they have beautiful patio and decks that I'm sure would add even more to the stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:56:05.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
