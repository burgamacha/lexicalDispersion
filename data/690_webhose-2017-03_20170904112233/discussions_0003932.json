Rooms are small but that's New York for you! Location is great as you are just around the corner from Times Square and easy walking distance/commute to all the attractions. During our stay we only had one long wait for the elevators which was ok.\nWould definitely rebook again as a great price for a base hotel to explore New York - thank you to all the team at the Hotel from concierge team to catering, maid service and day staff - had a fabulous week. Check out the Irish bar a couple of doors up - brunch - big Irish breakfast $14 and a complimentary cocktail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:40:29.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
