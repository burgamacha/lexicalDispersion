Location is unbeatable. Next to the 911 Memorial and Museum, couple blocks to subway station and 8 min walk to Battery Park and ferry to Statue of Liberty.\nRoom was small but efficiently laid out and furnished so comfortable for 3 of us. Floor to ceiling glass doors so you can enjoy the view of the 911 Memorial and Museum as well as the plaza.\nSmall refrigerator and coffee maker were nice conveniences. Tiny bathroom with sink on the outside was efficient and more than adequate for the 3 of us for one night.\nSnacks in the lobby area were a nice convenience as well. The restaurant is a must. The view was spectacular and the food delicious. We appreciated being able to leave our bags after check out so we could go out unencumbered for the afternoon.\nI gave 4 stars instead of 5 because having one person at the front desk is simply not sufficient. The screens/monitors we used for check in and check out weren't intuitive enough to operate without some sort of assistance. Staff was friendly and helpful.\nRoom Tip: Room 1605 has a memorial view and is far from the elevator.
