The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean. Some of the furnishings are a bit dated, but it's easy to overlook that with the nice European old hotel feel one gets here. Once we had a heating issue in our room, and the manager was most accommodating in upgrading us on our next visit. The location is fantastic for visiting Museum Mile and Central Park. Coffee in the mezzanine lounge in the morning and a croissant from Sarabeth's next door are a great start to a day of sight seeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:53:24.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
