The hotel is very clean, well decorated, and gives off a boho vibe throughout. Next to the reception, they have a lounge with an \"honesty bar\" and chic decor. With a classy and minimalistic approach to design coupled with unparalleled customer service, Les Tournelles is exactly the perfect combination of staying in a big city while feeling right at home. Compliments to all of the staff who are discreet yet extremely professional in servicing their clients and anticipating their every needs.\nThank you so much for having us!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:30:03.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
