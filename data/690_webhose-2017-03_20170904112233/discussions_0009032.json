Tonight, I joined colleagues for a quick drink in the Star Lounge at The Ritz-Carlton Central Park and wow, what a difference. The room is intimate, warm, elegant and the servers attentive. However, what really impressed me and drove me to write this review, is George at the concierge desk. I only had a simple question - the location of the ladies room - and George was all smiles, warm and friendly. He is an outstanding asset to the hotel. I will rave about this hotel and recommend it to others simply because of George. What a great first and last impression!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:32:48.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
