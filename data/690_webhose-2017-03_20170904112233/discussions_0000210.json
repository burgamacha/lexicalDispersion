The hotel is located near Rome Termini, which was perfect for us as we travelled from Naples on the train. The hotel was easy to locate, the reception is on the first floor and there is a lift to use to get the luggage up. The staff were extremely helpful, friendly and helpful. We were fortunate enough to be able to check into our room early. Our room was a decent size for Rome, it was clean, modern and comfortable. There was enough room for our two suitcases. The bathroom was modern, clean and the shower had food water pressure. The hotel was able to print off our tickets for the Vatican and for our flights which was great. Our room rate included a buffet breakfast in the restaurant downstairs, it had a variety of options which was good. The hotel is in walking distance to a lot of the sites and close to the metro lines and Rome Termini. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:26:49.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
