We had a great room and was very clean. The elevators are a bit slow so maybe consider that if you're wanting to stay on a high floor. Sometimes we would have to take the stairs because it was taking so long. The front desk was very helpful and nice. Our thermostat in our room never seemed to work right and was always a little too warm but we would open our windows for some fresh air. That was fine until nighttime came. We had to sleep with earplugs in with the window open to get some air. The Pantheon square becomes popular at night and also very noisy if you're trying to sleep even with the windows closed. So if you're a very light sleeper, don't book a room with a view unless you have your earplugs ready.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:03:42.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
