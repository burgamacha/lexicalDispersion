We were welcomed and made to feel at home by Coralina who answered all our questions. Our room, on the 6th floor was clean and just right - a view of the Sacre Coeur was an extra bonus.\nWe were a stone's throw from the Gare du Nord and could easily reach other parts of Paris, by metro or on foot. I was a little anxious about the area, but we had no problems.\nWe highly recommend the Alane Hotel.\nRoom Tip: Make sure you the waitress knows the type of tea you would like for breakfast!
