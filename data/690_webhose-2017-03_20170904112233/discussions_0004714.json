I love this place! I called to see if I could get a better deal by booking directly with the hotel instead of one of the deals I saw online. So glad I did! They offered me an even better deal, and I ended up getting upgraded on top of that! My hotel room was the biggest, swankiest I've ever had in NYC. The service was excellent. The in-house sushi restaurant was a neighborhood hotspot. The bathroom was amazing and the products were good. When can I go back?\nRoom Tip: Ask for a higher room and you may get a great view of Columbus Circle See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:00:21.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
