It's not the Savoy or anything, but it was a great experience for an economy hotel.\nMy single room was, shall we say, a model of efficiency. I did not expect a vast room for a twin, and I did not get one, but it had everything I needed, including a nice fan (no AC, but it was March after all), a bed, a bath, and a place to put my things.\nThe room was kept up nicely the entire week, and was clean when I got there.\nUnlike many budget hotels I have stayed in in London, this one was not charmingly threadbare. It had a nice level of finish in the rooms and in the public areas. It felt on par with a Hampton Inn in America.\nI really enjoyed the included continental breakfast, which while not a traditional English breakfast (not really to my liking anyway) offered a nice variety, with toast, rolls, pain au chocolat, cheese, salami, boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, juices, etc. It was nice to be able to take advantage of this perk each morning before setting out.\nThe staff were unrelentingly friendly and helpful. The location was quite good, near Kensington Gardens, two tube stops on different lines, and plenty of neighborhood restaurants, pubs, and stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:12:26.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
