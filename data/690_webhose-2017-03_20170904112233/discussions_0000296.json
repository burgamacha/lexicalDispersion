The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Room was great and hotel clean and nicely located in a safe and upscale area. The staff delivered a birthday cake to the room and 7 staff members, including the chef himself, came to sing happy birthday to my daughter on her 16th birthday! I will stay there again if I ever make it to Paris another time. Couldn't say more about the hotel and staff\nRoom Tip: 5th floor was great view!!
