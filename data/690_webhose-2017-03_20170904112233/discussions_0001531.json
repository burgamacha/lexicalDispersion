The Rooms are cozy and comfortable designed by style. The location is FANTASTIC , walking distance from all the highlights and very quiet street facing the ancient site Forum of Augustus. Delicious quality breakfast (love the cup of berries and fresh orange juice) . The Staff are super helpful and friendly, they gave great tips and suggestions for restaurants and bars.
