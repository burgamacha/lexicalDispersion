Within steps are plenty of shoppes, restaurants and things to do. The hallways could be lit a bit more, they seemed very dark for a hotel. The rooms are very NYC size, very small. The only complaint I had was there is NO heat control and the room was WAY TO HOT! I had to leave the window open all night to cool down the room. The Check In/Out process was very easy and the employees all seemed very nice! For travelers looking for a clean room with decent rates, Hotel Newton fit the bill!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:35:39.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
