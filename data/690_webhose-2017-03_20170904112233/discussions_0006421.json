Rooms are spacious and comfortable, facilities in room ample for a short stay. Perfect location, being a few minutes walk from Hammesmith tube station. I needed flexibility for my stay, as I was booking on a day to day basis. This was not an issue, every single member of staff was helpful, professional and polite. Breakfast is served for all guests, and a small range of hot and cold foods available.\nWill definitely return, and would recommend to anyone. It's rated 3*, but I would personally rate it higher.\nRoom Tip: I stayed in 3 different rooms, and the aach were equally good.
