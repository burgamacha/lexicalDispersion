The room with two queen beds was a good size for New York City. The heat is radiator heat and is controlled by a dial on the radiator. A window air conditioner worked well during our stay. The 2 outlets by the nightstand were so nice b/c the outlets have space to charge 2 USB devices and they are at a handy height. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows were great. It was wonderful to have a small refrigerator (mini bar) in the room for food we bought for breakfast and snacks. The hotel has one ice machine, which is just off the lobby. A microwave is also in that space along and a vending machine w/candy etc.. Our floor was pretty quiet with the exception of a couple guests slamming doors and talking too loudly in the hallway, which the hotel cannot control. It was quite minimal fortunately.\nThe location for us was quite good. We wanted to be within walking distance to the Metropolitan Opera (about a mile). The hotel is steps off 77th and Broadway, Westside Market (it has everything we needed) is around the corner & a CVS drugstore is across the street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:12:19.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
