We were on the 20th floor and had a full unobstructed view of the tower. Lobby and bar area is small, was cold so no outside area, but in the summer when the plastic is rolled up it must be great to sit outside and enjoy the view. No real amenities, but if your a tourist, who wants to spend all day at the hotel. Only complaint about room is bathroom had no counter space, so if you both have toiletries, good luck! Also has a see thru shower, so if you are afraid to be naked in front of your roommate, not the right room for you! Oh yea, LOVE it that the window opens a little for some fresh air, and instant AC when cold outside!\nRoom Tip: Anything 20th floor and above is great. 2007 was a great view from bed of the Freedom Tower.
