It has an awesome lobby, 1 flight up from the ground level. It's in Soho -- a great location. The breakfast is terrific. Fresh, lots of choice, yummy. Teatime or cocktails in the lobby/lounge with comfy couches is totally great, except for the occasional pit bull. (Sorry, I'm allergic to dogs.) I would like to suggest that when the hotel renovates the rooms, they use lighter colors. The rooms are small. Using a lighter, brighter palette would make them feel less claustrophobic. I'd also like to suggest that you put in a real gym. And lastly, and perhaps most important, the hotel staff and the wait staff are really good. I love staying here.
