My first stay was 8 years ago and when we returned to Paris in 2017 the quality was still there. The breakfast is fabulous! I was looking forward to it before we even arrived and it held up to what I remembered. There is a great variety to choose from and the quality of the offerings is superb. Made-to-order omelets and crepes are among the offerings. The hotel is located near a major metro hub and this adds to the overall convenience. Whether you are off to stroll Paris for the day or heading to Disneyland (1 train), the train and metro hub makes this hotel an location ideal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:37:14.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
