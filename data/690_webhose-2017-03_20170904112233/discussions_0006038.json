On a quiet side street near the St Augustin Metro, with nice newly refurbished rooms and a decent breakfast. The rooms are very clean and nice but very small. I love the windows that open and the fact some rooms have a balcony. The staff are very discreet and accommodating. Last stay was 4 days in Nov 2016 and will stay again in March 2017. highly recommend this hotel for the visitor or business traveler who want a clean, nice and inexpensive room in the heart of Paris.\nRoom Tip: ask for a corner room, great sweeping views with the open windos.
