Despite my unadvised early arrival, the very nice french man sitting right from the check-in desks managed to find me a room (my originally assigned room was not available yet). I forgot his name, but he was friendly and helpful throughout my stay - kudos to him!. The refurbished rooms on the sixth floor are upgraded to modern traveler needs: plenty of USB charge ports, possibility to connect your laptop via HDMI to the TV. Despite the layout with the sink outside the rest of the bathroom might surprise you initially it actually give the room a more spacious impression. Breakfast and bar were good. Would definitively consider again, also for private visits.\nRoom Tip: The sixth floor have recently been renovated but maybe priced slightly higher though.
