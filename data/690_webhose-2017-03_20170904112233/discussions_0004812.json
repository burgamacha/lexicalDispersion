The beds were super comfy and rooms very spacious. I was upgraded to the club level which is quiet and private but unfortunately no views except of thesurrounding buildings. The hotel is located downtown between 2 of luxury malls in Beijing and part of the old financial district.\nYou can access some of the store via the basement. Breakfast buffet was a good mix of east and west with an egg and a noodle station. It's a good option for biz travellers but tourist travellers may like to venture else where.\nLocated in the inner ring is it is probably an okay option for travellers keen to check out the sites in the middle of town. Take a about 45min to 1 hour from airport by taxi.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:55:48.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
