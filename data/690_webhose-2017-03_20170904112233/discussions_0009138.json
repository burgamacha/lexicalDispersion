The first time they were renovating it. We were impressed by the way they managed to juggle the building work and keep the guests happy and rooms clean. So thought we would see what it was like now. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We had room 204 a double at the front. Although the rooms are small compared with American hotels. It was well equipped. Safe, hairdryer, soaps. The shower was powerful and warm. The front rooms can be noisy with the traffic. But was nice in a morning to watch the Rome traffic!!! Just a couple of suggestions. Coffee and tea making facilities are not in the rooms but are available free if required. Would be nice if it was standard. Only 2 English TV channels both news. Would be nice to have an entertainment channel as well. For a bit of chill down time after busy days sightseeing.\nWe ate in the restaurant one night. Small but varied menu. Good value for Rome. Plenty of small shops, cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area. Easy to get into Rome bus stops near hotel. 714 into town about every 15 mins. Or 30 express to Vatican. 1/2 hour walk to Appian way and Quo Varis church.\nWould recommend and we would stay again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:01:31.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
