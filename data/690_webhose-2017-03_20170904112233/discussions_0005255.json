It is in an ideal location, around the corner from Times Square. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very small but clean and nicely decorated. The pool is on the smaller side as well, but it was lovely and our kids were obsessed with it and they fun colored lighting. The drinks were overpriced, but this is NYC and pretty much everything is overpriced everywhere you go. We would absolutely stay here again and it is recommended by our family! The price of the room was not bad at all for the location and the friendly service. It was the best value hotel I found while searching online. We got a special surprise because the hotel is across from the back door of the Hudson Theater, where Jake Gyllenhal is performing \"Sundays in the Park with George,\" so we got to see him on his way out! The hotel also offers discount parking in a nearby garage, so be sure to ask if you are driving in and they had buy 1 get 1 free drink vouchers for their bar. Even the mini bar prices seemed pretty responsible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:35.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
