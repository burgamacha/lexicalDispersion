I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. It is very basic and very old and dated but for what we paid the location was perfect. Lots of bars and restaurants close by. We didn't bother with breakfast at hotel as lovely little place round the corner. We loved Rome but it is quite expensive there. Lots of lucky lucky men hassling in the tourist spots selling selfie sticks etc which are a pain. Hard Rock Cafe short walk away which we loved. We had the open top bus pass to hop on and off which is well worth the money. I would stay in this hotel again but as I say basic. Clean towels, clean bed, maid service and hot shower so ok for money", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:51:01.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
