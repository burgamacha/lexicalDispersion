Stayed for a birthday celebration for my partner. The suite was prepared beautifully and we were made to feel very welcome. Room was clean and hotel is very sheek. We stay in a lot of hotels and professionalism and friendly staff is a deal breaker for us. Thankfully First Hotel hire the right people and look after its guests very well. Massive thank you to Madaliene and Vanessa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:45:34.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
