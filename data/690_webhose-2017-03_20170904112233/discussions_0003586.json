It's also the first time I've stayed at this hotel. The place and the service was amazing! They were so welcoming and accommodating to my family, especially the children. The rooms were clean, spacious, and the hotel front desk even remembered our names and our room numbers after we've returned from our first day exploring the city. Staying at this hotel made our NYC experience even more special. We will definitely stay there again for our next trip to the Big Apple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:02:20.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
