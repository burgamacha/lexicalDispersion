This hotel was just what we were looking for, elegant but without gym/spa etc which would have pushed the price up. However, it is the extremely pleasant and efficient staff that makes the hotel outstanding. Those at the desk, the concierge, doorman, bell hop and breakfast room staff were smiling and extremely welcoming. Taxis were obtained by the Concierge, tickets booked to attractions, eating and shopping recommendations offered. All a great success and can't recommend the hotel highly enough.\nRoom Tip: Ground floor rooms have small patios See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:50:33.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
