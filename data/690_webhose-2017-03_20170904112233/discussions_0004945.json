The staff were friendly. The location is not my favourite place but it is close to restaurant, cafe, bakery and grocery store. I like that it is 5 minutes walk to train. Couple of changes in train line to go to where we wanted to go so it flexed our navigation muscle.\nThe safe seems to be not working, no instructions on how to reset. But still it did not spoil our stay in paris. we always have our own padlocks anyway.\nOverall I think we got a very good value for a two star hotel. It lives up above expectations.\nRoom Tip: As far away from the 1st floor terrace smoking area See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:10:19.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
