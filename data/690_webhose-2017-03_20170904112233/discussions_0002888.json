Additionally, the concierge kindly surprised me too by providing chocolate dipped strawberries and red wine in our room on arrival. This was a wonderful gesture and was completely unexpected but genuinely appreciated.\nThe room was very nice with an alarm clock that had a USB port and a lightning docking station which enabled charging without the need for a UK to US plug adaptor. There were bath robes in the room and good quality toiletries.\nWe had cocktails in both Triomphe and Lanterns Keep over our stay. The chocolate martini is delicious.\nThe hotel is in an excellent location which puts you in the heart of the city.\nOverall, a fabulous 2nd stay and if I visit NYC again, this would be my first choice.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:08:48.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
