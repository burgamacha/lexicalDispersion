It is a ten minute walk from the main railway station (Rome Termini) and is just off one of the main thoroughfares (the Via Nationale). The rooms are not huge but are thoughtfully laid out to make the best use of the room available and are well appointed. The bar area is pleasant but under-used and is not always staffed (particularly at lunch times). Breakfast is characterised by abundance and breadth of offerings although those wanting something hot are likely to be disappointed (scrambled eggs, pancetta and \"hot dog\" sausages being the only options). There is no dinner service - but there are a large number of eateries of varying descriptions within a few minutes walk. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful throughout although the promised daily replenishment of the free mini-bar was a bit hit and miss (1 out of 3).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:37:59.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
