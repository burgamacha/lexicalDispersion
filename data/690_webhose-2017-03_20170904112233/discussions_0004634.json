Walking distance to 5th Ave shopping, Empire State Building, and Central Park. Large rooms. A lot more space then you would expect in New York. WiFi works. The staff is s wonderful and helpful. Lots of families stay here. Very quiet hotel rooms. There is a secure ATM on site. We thought the price was very reasonable. There is a sink area outside the bathroom, which is nice. The only problem we had was with the concierge deck, they were not help at all. They always directed us to someone else or told us just to \"do it yourselves.\" I guess I am just used to concierges in New York that knock themselves out to help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:50:08.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
