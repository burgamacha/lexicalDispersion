The breakfast we had was very good, a great variety of foods.\nThere was a little corner store across the road and the man was lovely.\nAlso a pharmacy right outside the door if you needed.\nNot sure if you had a car, where you would park.\nAnd they had a unlimited supply of lolly pops, that we helped ourselves to every time we passed them.\nIt's also a 1min walk to the Presidents residence.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:29:18.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
