From the moment we checked in we loved everything about it! The rooms are on the smaller size but that is a norm in Paris. The rooms are decorated nicely and impeccably clean!!! Christopher the conceige is extremely tentative and can basically accommodate anything you want to do or may need to make your visit to Paris special! We are American and do not speak French so arriving we were a bit nervous about reading menus and the young women and I'm sorry but I think her name was Doreen took us up the step to a nice cafe and explained some helpful information when ordering from menus! Can't say enough good about this hotel excellent location!\nRoom Tip: We had a room that overlooked the courtyard.
