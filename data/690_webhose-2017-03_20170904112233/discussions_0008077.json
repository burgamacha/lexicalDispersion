No more than you would expect if you paid full price but we were lucky to get a good deal.\nWe would definitely stay again on a deal but obviously not on full price.\nA couple of niggles but only minor and didn't detract from the stay, more for feedback.\nWe arrived at 15:50 and the room wasn't ready. It should have been ready at 15:00. We got in at about 16:20 which after a long journey wasn't great. I would have expected more from a top hotel. The hotel gave us complimentary nibbles and a drink which was very nice but the room on time would have been better.\nThe room overlooked some fairly substantial refidgeration unit I thi think so there was a constant hum / noise but again it didn't detract too much and you do expect some noise in london.\nThe bed was on castors so when you leant against the headbood the bed slipped away from the wall so we had to wedge the chair between the bed and the tv stand.\nAgain all these are minor but just expected better from one of londons best hotels.\nPlease bear in mind wit the above that we were happy with our stay and recommend the hotel if you want excellent service and clean fresh rooms of good size. Service would have been 5 stars if the room had been ready on time\nRoom Tip: Room 304 overlooks the refridgeration See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:53:57.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
