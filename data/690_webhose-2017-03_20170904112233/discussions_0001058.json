The rooms are contemporary and appear new. The breakfast buffet is costly as I paid 14.98 for breakfast. The staff are friendly and asked if they can assist you. The front desk provides 2 bottles of water upon your arrival in which I like due to not wanting to drink the hotel water. I enjoy staying at Hilton Garden Inns as I feel relaxed while setting in the lobby area enjoying free lemonade and cookies at the end of a log business day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:09:57.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
