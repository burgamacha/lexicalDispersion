This little hotel is on a quiet side street very close to the Gobelins metro. The small rooms (although size is consistent with Paris standards) are done in a slightly chic/eclectic/retro style. (Not always a great thing : the 60s era desk chair needed the provided cushion: without it, very uncomfortable.) Clean. Wifi was good. Breakfast was the usual Euro/continental selection with nice croissants, brioche, breads, plus ham and cheese.\nLocation is close to the well-known Rue Mouffetard which has a lot of little shops and restaurants. From there you can continue to the Pantheon in the 5ieme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:52:24.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
