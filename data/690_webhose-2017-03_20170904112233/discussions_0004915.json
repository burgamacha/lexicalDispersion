In our eyes Marius and the Chesterfield Mayfair team have raised the bar to new levels. Fabulous food and service. We went for my wife's 60th and took the family which included a 2, 5 and 15 year old and each and everyone of them thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Sandwiches were good sized with good fillings, the cakes ate as well as they looked and the chocolate scones were like brownies, gooey and soft. Mouth watering. The team were so child friendly too. No one has stopped talking about it since. The Willy Wonka character was also great fun, not intrusive but all in character and keeping with the theme. It may seem expensive but what you get for your money is well worth it and gave us all a head full of memories. Absolutely fantastic afternoon out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:38:32.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
