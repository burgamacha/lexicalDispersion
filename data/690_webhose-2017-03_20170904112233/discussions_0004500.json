My wife and I had stayed several nights in Rome prior to the cruise at another splendid hotel, but be both regret not spending more time at this phenomenal establishment. The staff was extraordinary and genuinely welcoming. We originally booked a deluxe room with a view, but when we told the staff at check-in we were finishing up our honeymoon, we were upgraded to the Keats and Shelley suite! The suite was flawless, and the views were unbelievable. We had originally planned to explore this particular area of the Eternal City, but once we experienced the suite we just stayed put and took everything in. The impressive breakfast delivered to the common area the next morning was another superb act on the behalf of this establishment, and a welcome start to our journey back home. We're ever grateful to the staff for making the last night of our honeymoon so absolutely unforgettable, and we'll definitely be staying with The Inn at the Spanish Steps in future visits to Rome.\nRoom Tip: Rooms with a view of the Spanish Steps are truly worth the additional cost.
