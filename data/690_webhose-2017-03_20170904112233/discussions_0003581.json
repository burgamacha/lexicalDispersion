It's just a short walk from loads of lovely restaurants and bars (in fact the restaurants opposite the hotel look good!) The hotel itself is boutique, very clean and modern and Parisian. We have a lovely large window/doors overlooking the square and a comfy bed with just about enough room for everything. The nearest metro is saint-paul which is a very short walk away.
