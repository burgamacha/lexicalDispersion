There are closer hotels to my place of business but TSQH makes you feel so comfortable, welcome and at home.. Nothing is ever a problem there. One of the front desk manager Raquel Ortiz is the one that makes a real difference. If I know I will be late, she helps me get a room facing toward times square. She has even helped me get a room \"over the top\" when they were full, betting that some people would cancel by 6. She is there with a nice hello in the morning and is always willing to solve any issue if one arises.. She really makes the difference for this hotel. She makes it feel very welcoming !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:20:25.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
