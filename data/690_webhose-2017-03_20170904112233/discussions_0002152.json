Well run hotel situated right in the heart of Union Square near great shopping and restaurants. Quiet rooms with high ceilings and modern amenities. Our room on the 14th floor faced south with clear views of the freedom tower and lower Manhattan. Fresh from a recent facade facelift and living room refresh, this hotel is hard to beat. Plus, the GM is a peach. We happened to run into him at the hotel bar- the Irvington, a Gerber run restaurant and bar. We'll be back, Bill!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:51:59.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
