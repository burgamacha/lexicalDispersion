The hotel is very clean , our deluxe room with king sized bed and windows and terrace facing the plaza fountain and busy streets just below us. Centrally located you are steps away from shopping , dining , and points of interest . The staff are welcoming and very courteous . Seeing smiling faces, beautiful rooms, full breakfast buffet every morning . This Hotel delivers . Would definitely book here on my next trip to Rome, Italy.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:35:36.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
