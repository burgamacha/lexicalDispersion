The location of the hotel is excellent, and although there are several bars and restaurants nearby, the room was generally quiet (although ours was facing in to a courtyard and there was a bit of noise from some people on a Friday night, but I'm not complaining). The breakfast was average. The only downside is the small size of the standard rooms: in our room, the bathroom was small, it opened directly on to the room as long as the doors and the door on the small storage space were opened/closed in a particular order, and there was very little space for hanging up or packing away clothes. Despite the size, though, the room was very clean and well maintained. There was also complementary Nespresso coffee in the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:38:48.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
