From the outside the hotel looks exceptionally small but once inside it opens up and is very impressive. The reception team were extremely friendly and polite and were always available to help.\nWe stayed in room 612 which was a deluxe twin. Its was at the rear of the hotel which helped minimize any street noise and we enjoyed 3 wonderfully peaceful nights sleeps. The room was extremely well decorated and the bathroom massive with a full bath, shower, sink and plenty of toiletries.\nIn terms of location it could barely have been better. We were one street back from the Louvre and within easy walking distance to Notre Dame and Seine. We took a walk along the river up to the Pont de L'alma bridge and then up to the Arc De Triomphe coming back along the Champs -Elysees. A long walk but well worth it when you can go back to this hotel and soak in a hot bath with a glass of champagne.\nBreakfast was fine but could be improved and the provision of coffee pods in the room seemed to be monitored rather strictly. 2 pods only and if more needed we needed to ring reception to request these.\nOverall view is this was an excellent choice. A hotel that is well run and managed by a great team.\nWe will be back\nBest Regards\nMark O' Donnell", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:46:46.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
