My daughter and I were extremely happy with our choice. First, the hotel was immaculate. Room was cleaned to spotless perfection every day. Lobby and breakfast area were always clean. Second, the breakfast has to be the best deal in town. The choices were huge every day and food was constantly re-supplied. Tables were constantly cleaned and staff was very friendly. We stayed eight days and had bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy, and many other choices throughout our week. The buffet alone would save a family a lot of money. Third, our room was on the 8th floor (823) and faced Lexington Street. We did get street noise because NYC truly never sleeps. I did use ear plugs that the hotel provided, but my daughter slept fine without them. If you are sensitive to noise, you should probably ask for a room on a higher floor. Our room had two queen beds, and a wonderful kitchenette area. We had more than enough room and loved the big window to see the big Apple. Fourth, the location was the best in town. We were three blocks from the subway and used it almost every day. We were minutes from Grand Central Station where we bought our Metro (subway) pass. Grand Central also has many shops and eating places. We walked to the Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Plaza,Times Square, and Central Park.\nThis might be too much walking for some people but taxis were always in front of the hotel. We also used Uber and Lyft. Delis, restaurants, and drug stores are all around the hotel. I would definitely stay here again and hope to return. Thanks Residence Inn.\nRoom Tip: Get a room on a higher floor if street noise interferes with your sleep.
