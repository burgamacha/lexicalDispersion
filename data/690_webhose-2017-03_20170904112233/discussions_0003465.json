As a former New Yorker who lived here her whole life before moving away 7 years ago I can say that the location is central, rooms are much bigger than the norm, and the staff is beyond accommodating; These are the three main thing you want when staying in Manhattan. The views are spectacular and everything is on your doorstep. Do try the Thai restaurant next door called VIV (excellent), or walk to anywhere in midtown really. The elevators are amazingly fast for a hotel with that many floors and the rooms are spotless. They also provide $10 credit a day from their shop which is good for a big bottle of water and some snacks..I've never seen that in a NYC hotel before... I have been back to visit many times but this is the place I'll stay going forward!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:25:43.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
