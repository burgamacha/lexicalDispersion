The staff are all very accommodating and pleasant. The location is kinda tucked away at the end of the street but that actually works in its favor. You're away from all the traffic and you can enjoy the peace. When you're ready to venture out, you're literally a block or so away from all the action of Soho Square. The property is very clean and has a modern sophisticated feel about it; very comfortable. My wife and teen daughter were both very impressed with the quality of room. If we ever make it back to London we would not hesitate to stay here again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:58:33.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
