My room - 406 - was clean and well presented, OK it was not the biggest room I've had but it had everything you need - good bed, tea and coffee making facilities, small shower room with toilet, desk, hanging area for jackets and a place to put your suitcase. The towels provided were massive, seriously big!\nBreakfast was good and as normal nowadays serve yourself.\nThe area round the hotel is safe - Police Station across the road! Handy for the IWM as well - I could see it from my rooms window.\nAll in all a good hotel that I will use again mainly for the location but also for the attitude of the good humoured staff and the nice clean rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:14:11.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
