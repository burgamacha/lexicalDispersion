It was worth every penny and more!! From the time we checked in on our very first day to the time we were getting in the car to go back to the airport all of the staff could not do enough for us!!! Every staff member we encountered was so friendly and helpful and polite, I don't have one negative thing to say about any of them. The rooms were a great size and spotlessly clean, cleaners in every day with fresh sheets and towels. The beds were so comfortable it felt like I was at home in my own bed. The location is fantastic as you are right in the center of everything but it wasn't too loud at night. In the morning there is complimentary tea coffee and muffins in the lobby. Take advantage of these, the muffins are lovely and the tea is good and strong. Next time I am going to New York I will be staying in the Wolcott again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:06:23.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
