I am used to travel the world in beautiful hotels. This time I needed a very well located hotel and modern/nice/design for a tight budget for my business trip... I could not find better than Ekta. Almost on champs ElyseÃÅe and behind GeorgeV.It is family managed, very professionaly, the bedrooms have every confort like a very nice 4 stars hotel (in your room:Nespresso machine,tea boiler,iron,a safe, flat Tv screen, extremely confortable bed and pillows, nice kit for the shower). They wanted to be only a 3 stars so It is the best 3 stars hotel in Paris! The interior decoration is very young, nice and modern, bathrooms are superb and bed extremely confortable. I had a big bedroom because they updated me but I know the normal bedrooms are small, it does not matter when you are so well located in Paris...\nCongratulation, I will be coming again very soon and recommande my friends from london.\nAudrey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:41:24.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
