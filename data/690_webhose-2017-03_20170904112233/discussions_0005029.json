The hotel was located a fantastic location, within walking distance from the Eiffel Tower. If you enjoy walking, you can actually walk to the Louve, Musee D'Orsay. The public transportation system is excellent and simple. I did not use it but was told by my co-tour members that the system was fairly simple and more cost effective to get around. You would need to review the underground subway, Metro, or bus system. Buy the packet of 10 tickets because, it's more cost effective. It is fairly easy to obtain this at one of the Metro center, there is one about 2 blocks away or less. The hotel staff members are very friendly and the breakfasts provided delicious many choices to start the day. The rooms are comfortable with more room and usual. It is clean and has free Wifi. I would stay here again, I would like to return to Paris in the next couple of years or so. Two days are not enough to see everything. We did not see the Eiffel Tower in our room but you have a fantastic view in the fitness center. At 9 pm, 10 pm and 11 pm, the lights of the Eiffel Tower will twinkle for about 5 minutes. What a sight to see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:34:55.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
