Although there were plenty of other excellent hotels, The Milestone was the one, which we liked best and our decision was absolutely right. From the beginning of our stay until the end, there was nothing that could have been any better.\nThe staff was always caring and so courteous. We felt very special.\nIn some other hotels we have been, the people 'had to be nice' to their guests and you did feel that. But at the Milestone, we experienced that everyone is authentic, honest and truly wants to help you make your stay an unforgettable one.\nThe food was so delicious. I have never eaten so much good food at one place in such a short period of time.\nWe also went to the SPA, where you can find a pool, a sauna and a fitness center.\nEverything was very clean and we enjoyed it.\nOur room was wonderful and with so much small and beautiful details. The room service was there two times a day and everything in every little corner was clean.\nIn the end, I would like to thank the Concierge Timothy, the portier Patricio and our helping hand Frank. They were truly committed to make our stay prefect.\nThank you! And see you soon!\nDominik Schneeberger\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:10:58.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
