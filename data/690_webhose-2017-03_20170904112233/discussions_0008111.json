For a 'no frills' hotel there are quite a lot of frills in the room.\nThe TV is brand new and of a good spec. There is also a wall panel where you can plug in tablets using a HDMI or USB connection which is great for little uns.\nThere is a decent selection of coffee and teas. The beds are comfortable and the ac ect. all work well.\nBathroom facilities are clean and there are plenty of towels.\nRestaurant and bar are solid with a good range of options on the menu.\nOnly negative is the high speed internet option takes forever to connect to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:11:11.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
