The bed was very comfortable with a selection of pillows. We asked for another feather pillow and received it immediately.\nWe had 2 large smart TVs in the room and were able to stream our media content into them quite easily.\nThe bathroom was modern, clean, well-lit and spacious with a large shower, although the water pressure was not the strongest.\nThe free minibar was a wonderful and useful treat and so was the complimentary Prosecco in the lovely roof top bar.\nBreakfast was superb, with a wide selection of bread, cheese, cold cuts, vegetables, fruit, pastry and excellent mozzarella and ricotta served to the table by the staff.\nThe service is first class by all the staff members we met and the front desk is very knowledgeable and efficient, and will assist with all your requests and needs with a smile.\nThe location is also very convenient with main attractions within 10-20 minutes walk, It is also close to the underground and bus lines.\nThere are excellent restaurants within minutes' walking distance of the hotel.\nYou can't go wrong staying in this hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:24:20.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
