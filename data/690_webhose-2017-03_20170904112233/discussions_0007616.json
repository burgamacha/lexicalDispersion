Just a short walk from the metro station Ecole Militaire this is a hidden gem - close to just about everything but conveniently hidden away on a small and quiet street. The owners and staff are very nice and they will give you advice on the best restaurants and sights if you ask. If you are lucky you will get a room overlooking the Eiffel Tower but all rooms are newly renovated and a pleasure to stay in. For me this hotel is my home away from home and I love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:17:55.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
