Great access to places, very convenient. Rooms were great. Very modern and relaxing and also very clean, however I was only stay 2 nights and the bed sheets didn't get changed once but obviously they wasn't dirty but I was expecting them to be changed. Breakfast was delicious and fresh just could of done with some greasy grub. My only downfall was the lack of knowledge staff showed about the area when it comes to tourists who aren't 100% on where to go and what to do. I also got charged twice on my room so this receptionist said and he didjt seem bothered about sorting it out. I had to ring booking.com myself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:17:08.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
