The heat in the rooms is excessive - the thermostat was 26/degrees C (79 F) and would not change. I asked every day with no results.\nThe staff all answered \"yes\" when asked if they speak English, yet none of them had even basic knowledge of any English words.\nThe concierge booked flights for us, arranged taxis to the airport, yet told the drivers the wrong terminal!! This mistake at the huge Beijing Airport was critical - it takes almost an hour to change terminals.\nThe physical characteristics of the hotel were fine - comfortable lounge, wonderful buffet breakfast, and great location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:49:31.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
