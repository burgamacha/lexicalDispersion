The staff is fantastic! They are willing to make dinner reservations, plan tours, etc . You can not ask for a better location right next to the Pantheon and walkable to everything. Breakfast was a wonderful buffet including pastries, eggs, bacon, sliced meat and cheese , breads, fruit, juices and coffee. The room was immaculately clean.. we had a room that faced the Pantheon.. could not beat that view! Roof top has a lovely bar open in summer but we did go up to enjoy views and take pictures! This will always be my hotel of choice when in Rome! Thank you to the staff for another great time!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:06:52.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
