We had tickets for a gig at the Eventim Apollo which is about 7 mins walk straight down King St towards the station and turn right; the apollo is right in front of you. The hotel room included an all-you-can-eat breakfast at a very reasonable price for this side of London. We had a room right at the end of the corridor which was very quiet. It was well proportioned with a shower en-suite. Everything was clean. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. As Hammersmith station is so close this hotel is actually well placed for all amenities in central London. Also, within easy walking distance, are the walks along the Thames towards Chiswick House, The London wetlands centre just across Hammersmith Bridge, Olympia, etc.\nRoom Tip: Our room was on the 2nd floor and quiet although overlooking King St. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:54:01.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
