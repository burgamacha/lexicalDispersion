The location in Midtown was great, so close to Macy's and Penn Station and it was really easy to get around to other places.\nThe hotel itself was clean, modern and comfortable. The staff were really friendly and helpful, and there was free WiFi (even in rooms). This made a big difference and it is so nice to stay somewhere where they aren't attempting to extort you at every opportunity - WiFi was free, in room safe was free, and there was a little sign in the bathroom that said they would provide any forgotten toiletries free of charge.\nAlso - BREAKFAST WAS FREE. This was my favourite feature, and is so rare in NYC hotels (especially at the more reasonable end of the market). Whilst serve yourself, it was very nice and there was a wide selection, and it really made a difference being able to start the day without being starving and searching around for somewhere to eat.\nI can't recommend highly enough, the hotel made for a very enjoyable stay in the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:37:28.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
