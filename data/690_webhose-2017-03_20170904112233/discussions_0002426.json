They offer a wide selection of high end services which we were not able to fully take advantage of but the few we did were executed well. I ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to be delivered as a celebratory drink which was overlooked but after I inquired about it they sent up both a complimentary bottle of champagne as well as a wonderful chocolate dessert which was more than welcome. The room was well appointed and well-laid out, the bed was very comfortable but lacked a top sheet which I thought was odd. The quality of the bed clothes was very high and they changed them every day we were there. We ordered several items off the room service menu, the cheeseburger, wings, Caesar salad, and a few other odds and ends. It was all delicious and came up to the room promptly. The bathrooms seem to have been recently renovated, and are well appointed with an electric mirror, large shower and beautiful marble tiling. Overall our stay was comfortable, safe, quiet, and enjoyable. I look forward to returning to the Benjamin the next time we stay in New York.\nRoom Tip: try to book a floor above the 5th floor to avoid street level and construction noise.
