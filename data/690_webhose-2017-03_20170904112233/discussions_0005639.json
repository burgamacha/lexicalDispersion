The decor is fab, the breakfast was lovely and the staff are very friendly and helpful. A special mention to Marc who helped me and my friend get the supershuttle booked - thanks so much!\nThe bed was the best I've ever slept in at a hotel. The room was kept very clean and has everything you need. The shower was very powerful and was lovely to jump into after the cold days out!\nWe were kept waiting for our room to be ready for quite a while but was rewarded with an upgrade to a nice big room - this was perfect and we would like to pass on our thanks for the very kind gesture.\nThanks for a wonderful stay and we hope to be back soon.
