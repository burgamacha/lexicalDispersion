We were given an upgrade due to a noisy room before. The staffer at the front desk was very helpful, her supervising manager was an extremely nice woman who offered to us an upgrade without any discussions. The allocated room was with a superbe view over the Hudson river, the room was aslo totaly quiet no noise at all,many thanks for that unforgettable stay! The Breakfast room was stunning as well as the breakfast itself. Would always choose that Hotel again, not to mention the the very close location to the City of NYC.
