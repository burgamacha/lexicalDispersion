This hotel located right on top of Victoria Station. I have to say that this hotel has made a difference in making a beautiful vibrant city feel like home. Many trips are all about enjoying the city, and you come back to a good hotel. The best thing here is when you are in a four-star hotel (feels more like a five star) everyone has what sets it apart. Here this hotel is all perfect. I look forward to coming back and staying in my room (111). The rooms are a very comfortable size, very clean and modern topped with staff that makes this place, even more, home-like. They are all with no exception the nicest team together. I don't know how they can do it, but everyone goes beyond their way to make you feel like you are appreciated. It starts from the time you walk in to check in you are greeted in a very courteous manner (thank you, Sean, at reception) and escorted to your room where everything is explained. They provide you with free wifi, and our room reservation came with complimentary breakfast. Wake up in the morning for breakfast and the staff there will go beyond to cater to any requests. I have come after the breakfast time, and they were there waiting and did not make it like they were doing me a favor. They go over and beyond to make sure that everything is right. The nice thing is they remember exactly how you like your coffee every day. I do not think that this hotel can be topped and we are coming back. I have seen four-star hotels, but they are not The Grosvenor Hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:35:38.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
