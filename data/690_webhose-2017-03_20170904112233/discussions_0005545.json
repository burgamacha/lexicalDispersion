Very nice staff, great central location and walking distance from all the attractions. The rooms are arty but tastefully done. I had room 610 which was really quiet and big. Very clean and had all the amenities you need and free soft drinks! One slight concern was the shower screen allows water to seep through underneath and the floors get quite wet. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty with hot and cold selection.\nI would stay again when I visit next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:56:58.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
