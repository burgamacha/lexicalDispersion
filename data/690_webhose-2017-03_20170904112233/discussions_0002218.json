Hotel is conveniently located in Saint Germain des Pres, steps away from D'Orsay Museum and across the Seine from the Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral, but away from the crowds. The services include a very decent breakfast, with eggs made to your choice, fresh fruit, cheese, cuts, and assorted breads. They also provide free drinks in the lounge, and even a free android cell phone with free internet service up to 4 GB and free calling to Canada and US. The rooms were impeccable and a bit larger than most hotel rooms in Paris. Staff is truly professional and willing to assist. They offer transport to and from the airport for a fair price and the drivers were very polite and helpful too. We will definitely stay at this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:16:30.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
