It feels more like checking into a small apartment building. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. The location can't be beat. The palace mews is about 100 yds away, and Buckingham Palace is a 1/4 mile walk. The staff is great. They have good working relationships with local restaurants and a limousine service. There is no restaurant in the hotel, which could be a mark against them, but it's London. There are lots of restaurants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:05:08.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
