Its rooms are spotless and clean (with wood floors rather than carpet), with modern furnishings. We had 2 Queen Beds, and were provided with a crib for our baby. This is where my only negative comment comes in, and that is that the room is TINY, especially with the addition of the crib, which takes away even more room to move around. However, if one is travelling and staying in Manhattan, one has to also understand and expect that accommodations are going to be cramped. This is NYC. Staff, especially those at the front desk and in the breakfast room, are friendly and helpful. Being a family of 4 with 2 young children, we really appreciated the daily breakfast buffet. It offered all the basics that you need to start your day: scrambled eggs, bacon and/or sausage, yogurt, coffee, cereal, bread, juice, etc. It even has a waffle station with 4 irons so that you can make your own waffles.\nThe hotel is conveniently located close to Times Square, the metro stop at Columbus Circle (10 minute walk), and Central Park (13 minute walk). It's kind of tucked away on a quieter section W 58th Street where there isn't a lot of car traffic, though as previous posters mentioned, it is across the street from the hospital.\nHappy hour is also every night in the lobby from 4-7PM. It's not a very typical bar/lounge setting, as it's just a long table with some chairs and couches, but it was a nice way to wind down in the evening with a drink.\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay. It was great value, and we were treated very well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:46:32.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
