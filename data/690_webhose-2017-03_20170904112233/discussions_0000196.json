Was on my honeymoon with wife. Everything was incredible, from the checking in to the room. Was allocated the Eiffel Tower view room located on 6th floor. Must say, it was brilliant. Room was ready and well prepared to surprise my wife as she was also celebrating her belated birthday.\nThe hotel surprised us with balloons and complimentary drinks. Breakfast was included and it was wonderful. They served pastries and other lovely light snacks. The lady who served breakfast every morning was super friendly and helpful. She was way amazing.\nHotel is located near to Eiffel tower; about 15 minutes walking distance to Eiffel Tower. There are some pastry shops nearby and a convenient store too.\nRoom is big and so is the toilet. They provide HERMES bathing assessories too!\nDefinitely reccommendable to all those who visit Paris, France. Kudos Le Marquis. Brilliant!\nI do LOVE my stay at your lovely hotel.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:53:36.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
