The moment we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff who were happy to answer all our questions, arranged any sightseeing tours and a SIM card promptly. I wish we could remember the concierges name because he was amazing giving us tips on were to eat close by, walking directions and what days were best to tackle any of our tours.\nBeing walking distance to a lot of restaurants, shops, ATMs, Tiananmen Square, Donghuaman night market and so much else made it a lot easier.\nThere were only two little drawbacks. Understanding that both may come back to the fact that we decided to travel China in the dead of winter. We're not used to sleeping with the heater on all night and that made sleeping hard most nights and the shower/tap water took a very, very... very long time to heat up. Most showers were cold/lukewarm. This was the first leg of our epic stay in China and were a little concerned that this would just be a part of staying in hotels in China in winter but luckily didn't have those issues in any of our later stays.\nOverall the stay was spectacular and any mishaps were what made that stay a little more unique to us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:53:25.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
