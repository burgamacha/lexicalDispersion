Bathroom modern, and a touch I love at all HI Express the night light for the bathroom. For some reason the TV controls can be difficult and the last 2 times I couldn't find the radio.\nSurprised at good reviews of the bar and restaurant, the bar has limited wine list (2 or 3 reds) and short of staff. I ate one evening in the restaurant and my view is way over priced for what is effectively a cafeteria. Why not just offer a similar offer to breakfast, ie a buffet.\nBreakfast is included, and they even offer takeaways to facilitate that. I don't generally have breakfasts, but a sausage and bacon roll is too tempting!!\nMy main gripe is parking fees. Why charge Â£15 per day for guests, especially when there is nothing on at excel. There is little obvious alternative if you don't know the area, as there is no on street parking, BUT having stayed a few time here and elsewhere my advice is that the excel car parks outside doubletree and premier inn are a better bet (free after 5.30pm).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:39:46.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
