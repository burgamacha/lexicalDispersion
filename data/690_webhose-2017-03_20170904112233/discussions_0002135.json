The Standard hotel is all about style. The atmosphere ist cool and it is a great hotel for visiting New York as its location is convenient and the subway is just a few minutes walk away. Also all the rooms offer a great view over NYC.\nEverything is sleek and modern. We had a kingsize room on the 17th floor with a view towards the financial district. What a great view! The size of the room is ok and above average for NYC standards. I liked that the room had a bluetooth speaker I could connect my ipod with. Our room had a bath tube from which you where able to enjoy the view.\nAlthough the room was on the floor directly under the \"The Top Of The Standard\" bar we didn't hear any noise coming from the bar. BTW check out this bar. The bar itself is worth visiting the hotel. Great ambient and a decent selection of drinks.\nThe staff was very nice and helpful - thanks to Dave and Mike - which can sometimes be a total different story specially in NYC. I inquired about a late checkout and a room on a high floor via email before we arrived but I never got any answer. Thankfully everything was sorted out when we checked in.\nI can highly recommend this hotel and if the price is not too expensive I will stay there again on my next trip to NYC\nRoom Tip: Ask for a high room See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:59:46.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
