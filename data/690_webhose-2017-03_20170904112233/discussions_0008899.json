Spotless clean, recently refurbished, very nice service and kind people. I stayed in apt. number 10 which is a small single with shower in suite. There are some perks: clean towels, new soap bars, shampoos and conditioner every day. Also the kettle and hair dryer work fine and they supply some biscuits, tea and cocoa powder so you can have a snack if you in a hurry. Only downsides are there is no lift and no 24h concierge, so you have to leave your keys in the lobby of the next door hotel (Phoenix). It is not a big problem, but when you are tired and with packaging it can be a bit of a burden. Will be back for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:54:05.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
