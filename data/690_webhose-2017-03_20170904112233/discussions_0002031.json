The hotel is very convenient if you need to go there and use Penn Station. While checking in Andrew was excellent and very friendly. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite without even asking for it. He made sure that we had everything we needed and made us feel very welcome. The only con of the stay was that the room was very noisy due to cars horns, fire engines, etc.., but that is something that the hotel itself has no control over so can't blame them. The room was nice and very welcoming. We definitely would stay here again when we go to the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:45:41.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
