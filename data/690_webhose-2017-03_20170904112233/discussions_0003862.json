I'm pleased to report that the Walker Hotel has done \"Boutique Hotel\" pretty well! The room, although small, has a very comfortable bed and a wonderful, full on water pressure Two person Shower. We sprung for the balcony and it's almost as big as the room, nice place to have an after work cocktail. And speaking of cocktails, the bar is very nice with a full bar and good wine selection. All of this comes at a price.... It is New York City after all. But all in all there are way more expensive places to hang your hat. We got a complimentary breakfast in the restaurant and it was very good. We are having dinner there tonight will let you know in subsequent review how it was!\nAll in all a very successful staycation!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:53:06.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
