Fantastic location just 5 minutes walk from Herald square and 15m walk from Times Square. Very nice big room and comfortable huge bed.\nThe hotel and room are nicely equipped with all that's necessary. No bath but lovely shower with a wooden bench you can sit on while at it. the entire wall is a window - mine was overlooking 6th ave and the Empire State Building.\nThe restaurant down stairs Serbs lovely fresh pizza and you must try the salad with Salmon on the lunch menu. It's to die for. In the bar where they also serve breakfast (not included in the price, somewhat overpriced but delicious breakfast menu), there are great foods and drinks and lovely hostesses and waitress. Very professional. Don't miss going out for Korean BBQ in the Korean street very close by. Multiple shopping and dinning options just outside the hotel both ways down and up 6th ave. Got few items delivered at the hotel from Amazon without problems, but had a friend who had a different experience while trying to get things delivered to the hotel and the hotel lost them. Definitely worth recommending and returning to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:46:03.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
