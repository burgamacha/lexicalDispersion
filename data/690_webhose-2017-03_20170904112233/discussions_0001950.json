We chose The Wellington after I stayed here on a previous trip.\nOur room was small but well appointed - after all who stays in their room when there is the whole of NYC to be explored??\nThe room was clean, over looked the side of the hotel and was tastefully decorated. The pillows were comfy, bed clothes clean and changed during our stay when requested. The bathroom was clean, larger than in other New York hotels I have stayed in and no issues, hairdryer was welcome as my wife had forgotten to bring hers.\nThe reception staff were helpful and friendly upon check in and check out. The only issue we had was when we were Quote: d $50 to keep our room until 6pm but when we booked this we had to pay $60 until 5pm - nothing major but disappointed that the original Quote: wasn't upheld as we only booked it shortly after initially enquiring.\nThe location of the hotel is excellent and is a 5 miniature walk in both directions from Times Square and Central Park. The subway is right on the corner and for the price of a Metro ticket will get you anywhere, well worth it!\nWe ate a number of times at surrounding restaurants including The Brooklyn Diner, Cafe Metro, Cafe Europa, The Oldcastle Irish pub and Starbucks over the road.\nWe would certainly return to this hotel and would recommend it to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:47:42.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
