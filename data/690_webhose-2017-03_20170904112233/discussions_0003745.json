The hotel had a lot of great features:\nSelf check-in/out was fast and easy to figure out, the overall design is fun, the coffee/bar is really excellent. In room, the touch pad control of everything was easy to use and pretty cool. Most important (for us) was that it was pretty quiet - CitizenM did a good job of designing for sound insulation and noise reduction. The black-out blinds worked like a dream, too.\nThere were a couple of things we weren't crazy about: In an already small room, our suitcase didn't fit in the under-bed drawer, so we had to take up precious floor space with it. The counter area is TINY, so when trying to find space for toiletries and all that, it's tough. The HVAC was hard to get dialed in - the room is small, so when the blowers come on, it gets warm quickly. I imagine the same problem would occur with A/C in the hot months.\nOverall, we had a great stay here despite some of these minor annoyances. We'd definitely stay again for a one or two night trip. Anything longer would require a more traditionally sized hotel room for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:10:57.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
