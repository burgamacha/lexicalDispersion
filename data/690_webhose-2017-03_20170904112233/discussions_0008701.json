First of all, I really thank the staffs, who helped often me during my stay. The room was verz comfortable and the breakfast was also nice. It is so close to the Metro Station \"Pasteur\", that you can easily access the centre of the city. And there is a supermarket, restaurants, caf√©, bakery etc. nearby the hotel. I would like to stay at this again, when I come to Paris next time.\nRoom Tip: accessibility, sightseeing, comfortable, safe, 24 hours opened reception, large bed See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:03:33.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
