Leaving for the airport at 3am was no problem for the driver who was on time to the dot. I didn't get her name but the lovely lady working in reception on the night we were there was over and above what you would expect from a host; Warm, friendly and very considerate to our needs.\nLooking at the modern fittings and the extra's in the room one can tell that money has been spent on this accommodation to satisfy their guests. The real filter coffee machine and ground coffee was one such amenity, deserving special mention. A low cost perk that puts a sachet of Nescafe to shame.\nWill definitely stay again when I need an airport hotel in Entebbe. I didn't give 5 stars to sleep quality because I was only there for a few hours late at night and didn't use the bed, but it was a kingsize and felt very comfortable.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:11:20.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
