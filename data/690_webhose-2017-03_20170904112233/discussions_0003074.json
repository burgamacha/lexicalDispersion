We were satisfield with everything. We arrived at 9 a.m, but we could check-in immediately. The room was clean and well-equipment. The breakfast was good, and the cappuccino, that they made, was very good. The staff are friendly. The position of the hotel is perfect, because Termini is only 5 minutes on foot, and every sightseeing is available on foot. I really recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: 207, on the second floor, with big comfortable bed, spacious bathroom. It is quiet.
