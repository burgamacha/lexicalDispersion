We chose this due to location and reviews of previous guests. We were welcomed the friendly staff and enjoyed a delightful 2-day stay. The rooms were spacious by NYC standards, clean and inviting. The breakfast was a nice continental with many selections of baked goods, yogurt, fruit, coffee and juices.
