Also an ideal spot to visit Westminster with the Eye and other attractions within easy walking distance or a few minutes by tube. Excellent breakfast with enough choice for the pickiest of people. Reception staff were lovely and when we had a problem with the iMac it was resolved very quickly. Lovely room with nice comfy bed. Only downside was not enough milk in my room for night time coffees, I was too lazy to walk to reception to ask for more. But we would highly recommend this hotel and we chose it because it was part of the Hilton chain. Definitely would visit again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:05:48.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
