The hotel has been recently renovated and the room we had ( superior room) was nicely decorated. Although our room was directly on the street, there was no noise. Room was clean with all amenities included ( shampoo, sops, hair dryer, water kettle, safe), breakfast (we took the option with breakfast included in the price) was acceptable and the price really affordable...for Paris.\nReally plus point was the location: we were able to walk to the Louvre, to Notre Dame, Tour Eiffel, Place de la Concorde wishing 30-40 min maximum.And public transportation ( Metro) was at 5-6 min walk distance too.\nOnly minus point the Wi-fi quality in the room: very poor. Although it was ok in the lobby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:57:14.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
