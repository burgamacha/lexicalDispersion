We couldn't afford to stay at the hotel where our event will be held (lol) but we wanted to be within walking distance or a short subway ride away. We checked out TripAdvisor reports and were impressed with the BW Bowery reports so decided to take a chance. We were so beyond pleased that we could barely contain ourselves. The best of all bests is the staff - and I want to thank Lisa and other front desk staff but give a special shout out to Briana Chen who has since been working with us as we set up a room block for our May event for other guests attending our event looking for a more economical option. Here are my top ten reasons why I love the BW Bowery and would recommend it in a heartbeat:\n1. Location from LaGuardia - $44 cab ride\n2. Location from Battery Park/Wall Street area - 27 minute walk\n3. Location is excellent - in China Town but one block from Little Italy\n4. Fruit stands rights outside the door\n5. Wood floors in guest rooms (way better than carpet)\n6. Continental hot breakfast including bacon, eggs, potatoes, make-your-own waffles, greek yogurt, fruit, hot cereal, cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, juice and hot drinks\n7. Beds are comfy\n8. Floors in bathroom are heated\n9. Nice little chair and table by window\n10. Pretty quiet for Chinatown.\nThe ONLY complaint that I have is that there coffee is pretty low grade - but there are good gourmet coffee spots just down the street. I've booked back into the BW for over a week in May. I can't wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:33:20.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
