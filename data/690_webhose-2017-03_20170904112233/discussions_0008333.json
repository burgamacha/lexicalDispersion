Room was small by US standards but comfortable. Free breakfast which is a blessing in London. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. Transportation it's very expensive, You'd Have to buy an Oyster card for a £5 deposit (refundable) and unlimited (bus only) for about £5 per day. Supermarkets are also at a short 8 minute walk. Plenty of pizza/kebab spots at cheap prices. Overall you can't go wrong by staying here if you are on a budget. If I had to add a bit of a negative it'd be the amount of kids that use this hotel and these youngsters can get a bit loud.\nRoom Tip: Any room away from Lambeth rd.
