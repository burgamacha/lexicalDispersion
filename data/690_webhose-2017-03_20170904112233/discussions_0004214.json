This was only gonna be used to sleep in and I have to say the bed & the pillows were lovely and we had 5 great nights sleep on the 22nd floor. Rooms were cleaned beautifully each day and hairdryers are supplied BUT the only thing we missed was tea/coffee making facilities in the room but check out out machines for \"treats\" outside lift areas. The bar areas & seating area is great and people we know who live in NYC come here for drinks and meeting others so the vibe is lively. The staff on reception are wonderful, having lots of time to point you in the right direction and offering maps and know the right places to eat & drink. As this was a special occasion (St PatsDay) it was very busy time but we will relax and definitely stay in the Hudson Hotel on our next trip - Love from Cardiff South Wales...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:01:39.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
