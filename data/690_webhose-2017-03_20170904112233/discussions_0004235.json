The other reviews here are accurate.\nStaff was friendly and eager to assist. Really good rate for the location, and it is a great location. About a block away from Times Square and less noisy, several subway stops within a block of the hotel, and close to the Westside Highway l. Perfect location for my business trip.\nIf you are planning to see Amelie or A Bronx Tale anytime soon, these are playing right around the corner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:41:32.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
