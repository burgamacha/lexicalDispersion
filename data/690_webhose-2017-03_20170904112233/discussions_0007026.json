The staff is very friendly and attentive. The hotel is in a safe area and, if healthy, you can walk to almost all of the major sites in Paris - Champs-Elysees, Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais, Place de la Concorde, Arc de Triomphe - and is a short taxi/Uber ride to many others! The only limiting factor might be accessibility as the building approach is stairs, and it's fairly \"tight\" inside. This is normal in Europe but if you're from the United States it's not as open as you might be used to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:24.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
