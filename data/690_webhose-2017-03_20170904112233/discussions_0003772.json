It's a small stylish hotel located in Manhattan area. The hotel lobby looked very elegant. The room was nice and stylish as well. I stayed in a single Archer King room on the 3rd floor. It was very small - fine for 1 person. Not sure if they offer the same room for double occupancy. If they do, it would be too small to fit 2 people. Otherwise, everything was very good - heater (was very needed when it was snowing), very comfortable bed, nice and tiny wardrobe, safe, iron board with iron, complimentary Fiji bottled water. The slippers (very cute ones) and bath robe were also provided in the room (no need to call and ask for them). My room was equipped with a coffee machine, coffee capsules and assorted tea bags. Bathroom had a shower (no tub). Also, every evening I received complimentary pastries from the Chef. It was cute - nice touch. The room was clean.\nArcher has a restaurant which serves a la cart breakfast. It was nice and tasty. Room service was also good. The food was delivered on time.\nI would like to thank Maria who assisted me in check in/check out. It's always pleasant to deal with professional people.\nThere are two things which I could suggest based on my experience:\n1) To have an option to dim the light in the shower (or to have 2 levels of light). Personally it was very bright to me.\n2) To deliver the coffee in thermos (room service). It was delivered just in a mug which could not, of course, keep the heat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:15:01.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
