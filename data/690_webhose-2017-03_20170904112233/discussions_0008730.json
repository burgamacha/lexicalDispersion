The rooms are very small and noisy, but clean and otherwise suitable for what they purport to be. We were at #22 across the street and down some very narrow stairs.\nWe checked some bags while spending a couple of days in Paris. We were warned not to leave anything valuable in the bags, and I did remove electronics, etc. However, on return, I found my duffle bag had been unzipped and a pair of prescription glasses was missing. I'm not sure what else might have fallen out / been taken. I've emailed the hotel asking for them to search the luggage storage room, so fingers crossed that they will turn up.\nRoom Tip: ask about location of your room for train rumbling and street noise See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:18:50.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
