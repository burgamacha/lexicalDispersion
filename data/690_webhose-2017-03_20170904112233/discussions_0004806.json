The owners, the staff, everyone there is so helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and genuine. The location on the Right Bank is excellent, within walking distance of the Louvre and many interesting restaurants, shops, and places to see. Our Junior Suite was just right and attended to daily. The breakfast was included and delicious. There is even a cozy bar'lounge where one can have a glass of wine or a drink before venturing out to dinner at one of the nearby excellent restaurants.
