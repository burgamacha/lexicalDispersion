Although the room was tiny, it had everything we needed and the staff was attentive and helpful throughout our stay.\nThe rooms have no AC, but they found us a fan when we asked for one. The lift is very small also; this was only really a problem when we had luggage with us though.\nThis was also a great neighborhood with some fantastic little bistros and shops right down the road.\nI highly recommend this hotel.\nRoom Tip: The beds were a bit smaller than expected but the location and staff were fantastic.
