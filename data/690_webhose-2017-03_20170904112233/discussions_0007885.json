It is quiet and discrete.\nWe stayed for one night and our room was on the ground floor and had everything we could need. However, the amenity area was inside a cupboard, kettle etc above and fridge below which was not the best idea as it got exemely warm inside and the fridge stopped working, but not a problem as we did not use it.\nLarge bathroom with bath and full shower screen over. TV a little unresponsive but we got the hang of it.\nWe had an exceelent room only rate and did not partake of breakfast which all hotels seem to think they can charge an exhorbitant amount for. Having had a dinner out the night before we were happy to leave and go for a coffee and croissant later.\nWe will certainly look at staying here again, but I somehow doubt we will get the same deal at other times of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:41:09.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
