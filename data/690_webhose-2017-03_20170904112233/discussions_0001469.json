The location is excellent, a two minute walk from La Defence Esplanade metro station (the RER station at La Defense is a further five minutes west) right on the Champs Elysee with views over the river Seine towards the centre of Paris. The room I had was clean and tidy and importantly dark and quiet. The small breakfast room/restaurant was fine for an evening meal and quick breakfast in the morning. Avoid having to come here by car if you can as the car-park is across the square behind the hotel but still convenient if you have to travel this way.\nRoom Tip: Get up high for the views, ask for a room overlooking the river.
