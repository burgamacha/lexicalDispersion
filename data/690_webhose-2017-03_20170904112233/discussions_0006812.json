The rooms were modern, and clean and again the location is EVERYTHING! Walking distance to Columbus circle, Times Square and a bunch of awesome bars and restaurants (Mean Fiddler: it's a bar-lots of fun!). The only reason I'm giving a 4 out of 5 is because of the bathrooms- the water pressure sucked, and the doors were awkward because it left a gap and you could hear everything when someone was using the bathroom. Awkward! But that is just me being super picky- hotel was excellent, and so was the staff! Oh and they give free wifi- huge bonus especially for NYC hotels.
