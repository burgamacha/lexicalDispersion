There was some minor building work in the reception area which caused no problems for us but the staff were all so apologetic and even provided chocolates to say sorry for the inconvenience!\nThe rooms are extremely modern with smart TVs and with all the little amenities you'd need; bottled water, tea & coffee, shampoo & conditioner etc. It also had a safe which was very handy. Everything was cleaned and restocked everyday and all the cleaning staff that we bumped into were so lovely. We also really appreciated the memory foam beds, they were so comfy. When we went to Rome, although it was in March, it was 20 degrees every day so we massively appreciated having a fully functioning air con.\nThe hotel is within walking distance to all the main sightseeing spots, we walked to all of them with no problem although there is a metro which is apparently very easy to use. If you are planning to walk, make sure you get yourself a map and some good walking shoes!\nThe breakfast in the hotel was an American buffet and had everything you'd need for a long day, it was also really tasty. We stayed in the hotel for a couple of meals as the prices in the restaurant were much cheaper than what we found in nearby cafes and restaurants. If you are planning to have a few drinks, definitely stay in the hotel as it will save you a lot of money.\nThe gym although basic was good for some quick holiday workouts, but if you're walking everywhere you probably won't need it anyway!\nWe would just like to say a massive thank you to Robert on reception and Jones who worked in the restaurant/bar upstairs, you were both fantastic! Overall we couldn't find a fault with this hotel, if we were to return to Rome, we would 100% stay here again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:45:12.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
