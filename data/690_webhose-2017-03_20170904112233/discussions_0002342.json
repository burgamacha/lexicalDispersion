The whole building is remodeled yet it keeps its Parisian style. We stayed at the duplex and I 100% recommend it!!! Beautiful bathroom and very cozy bed, with amazing big window. Breakfast was wonderful and so many options of every kind, it has a beautiful outdoor patio but we went there in the winter and of course it was too cold to eat out. We also used the gym although small, it does have all you need for a quick workout. VERY VERY RECOMMENDABLE for a Paris stay!\nRoom Tip: duplex rooms are stunning See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:56:27.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
