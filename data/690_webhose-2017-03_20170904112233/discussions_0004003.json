The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and shower had great shower head and water pressure. The view wasn't much- view of apartments. You can get your views walking around the city instead. Check in and check out very easy. The fire alarm went off one early morning- last for 10 minutes- decided to go in lobby just in case. As soon as I reached the lobby, the alarm stopped. Noise level was ok in room- dud not hear any other guests, the outside noise such as traffic got a little loud at times but not enough to disturb sleep or you opened the windows you could hear if very clearly much I would expect from a busy city. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel- chose to go out since there is a bakery practical on every corner. The metro is just a couple blocks away, the bus stops are also close. When it was raining heavily, I chose to call for an Uber ride. Restaurants are everywhere- a lot to chose from. Grocery stores are also across the street or around the corner. Movie theater a few blocks away. Felt safe walking around the neighborhood at night and going back to hotel late- especially since family lived close by. What was important to me was cleanliness, location and safety- all boxes checked off. Enjoyed my stay here- definitely will come back!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:15:01.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
