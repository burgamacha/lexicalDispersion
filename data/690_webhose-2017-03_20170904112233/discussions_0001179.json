It's been two years since our last visit and in 2016 they did a major revamp of the entire hotel. The colors and textures of every space here have been rejuvenated! The rooms have even more warmth AND more hipness than before. It's boutique chic at it's best!\nWhat's even better is it still has an amazingly friendly and helpful staff. Most notably Sanjay Kaloya. He is a Concierge Clefs d'Or and lives up to everything that stands for. He has always been our key to wonderful visits and many fond memories of our visits to Paris. On this last visit he secured reservations for two virtually impossible to get into restaurants! His advice on any aspect of your visit can help improve the quality of you time in Paris.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:49:23.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
