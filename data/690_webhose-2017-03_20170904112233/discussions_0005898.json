For those of you who read my reviews you recall my post from approximately three months ago was less than flattering.\nI want to apologies. Although the post was true, I focused on one small incident that was part of an otherwise flawless stay. I just completed my fourteenth stay at iQ spreading over many years. Each stay has been a delight. The staff, with only one small hiccup, have always been very tolerant of my Texan ways.\nStepping back and looking at the whole package, iQ is simply a great place to stay, in a great location and staffed with good people. For the price I don't think you can do much better in Rome.\nYes Somona, fourteen stays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:47:29.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
