Away from all the hustle of the city, but close enough to get around everywhere. Rooms compact but not cramped. Bathroom with Kohler fixtures and toilet...Bath and Body toiletries. Clean clean clean! Comfy bed too.\nThe staff is the best ever!!! Gerard and Carlos in the bar are so gracious and friendly. Sophia in reception is a doll. She gave us tips every day on the easiest way to get around the city and the best places to go.\nWhen we come back to New York we will ONLY stay at the Cambria hotel. Loved the Chelsea area too. So much to see and do safe, good restaurants. Love it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:04:34.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
