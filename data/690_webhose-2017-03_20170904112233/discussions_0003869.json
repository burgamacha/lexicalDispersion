This is an amazing hotel thank you to Melinda Park the General Manager. We were staying for a christening the second time and she remembered and asked how it went. How sweet is that. Would you credit that we were in room 1502 on both occasions!!\nThe hotel is so close to so many tourist sights including 9/11, Wall Steet, Brooklyn Bridge, Staten Island Ferry, amazing eateraries in Tribeca and the ferries to Hoboken. The Canal Street subway round the corner will get you to everything else. Turn left when you get out of the hotel and left again and you are on 6th Ave walk straight up to Greenwich Village, beautiful shops.\nWe booked through Booking.com and noticed that the prices for this hotel change on a daily basis. 4 of us shared a room for Â£885 for 7 nights! Admittedly you need to be with family or your closes friends!!! Snoring!!! The room is big enough for a week sharing. I cancelled and re booked 5 time till I got this price which included breakfast\nCoffee and tea is literally on tap all day outside the wee restaurant. Breakfast was good with most choices for everyone. Sophie in the restaurant is amazing and will look after you but remember she is off on a Friday if you want to tip her. I missed her and was gutted I did not get the chance to say thank you. IF YOU READ THIS MELINDA WILL YOU LET HER KNOW PLEASE.\nDon't forget a wander up to floor 19 to the roof terrace the view is amazing especially of Manhattan Bridge.\nThere is a lovely small bar in the hotel although it's not always open.\nWe will be back sometime and would not look anywhere else than this hotel it's like home from home.\nThank you so much for looking after us.\nRegards to you all\nRoom Tip: All rooms are clean and comfortable See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:18:49.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
