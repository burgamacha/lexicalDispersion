We was greeted by lovely receptionists who would always help us to find where we needed to visit. The rooms are small and cosy and very clean always. Hotel is close to Cambonne metro station which you can access a route to the Eiffel tour even though it's only a 15 minute walk! Breakfast in the hotel was lovely, we didn't originally book to have breakfast but we wished we had! Good variety of food and coffee is amazing! If we return to Paris this will defiantly be number 1 hotel on the list! And will defiantly be recommending to anyone who would like to visit Paris!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:33:45.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
