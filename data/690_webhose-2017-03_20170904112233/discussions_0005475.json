To repeat the title of this review: I'm conflicted about writing this as I want to go back and not have it swamped with devotees more than it is already. But fair is fair.\nHotel Belleclaire is a gem for many reasons. The hotel itself: it's beautiful, boutique, perfect location. Easy to get cabs and 79th Street subway around the corner.\nThe coffee downstairs in the morning: my bad for not remembering the name of the lovely man who makes your coffee and lights up your day. He remenbered me from last time I stayed, months ago. He went around the corner to get me a croissant one day. He puts a smile on your face for the day.\nThe staff: we stayed for ten days through my husband's father's time in the hospital before his death and the services afterwards. The hotel was really busy, we were there in the middle of a snow storm AND YET. The staff understood our situation, were kind, compassionate, supportive, and got the reality that we didn't know when we would check out and they extended our stay as we requested day to day. David and Elana were memorably kind and supportive. Other staff too, our major interactions were with them.\nBravo, Hotel Belleclaire. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:13:20.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
