A brief walk north-west gets you to Paddington Station, while a south-west jaunt brings you to Lancaster Gate, giving you great access to multiple tube lines. If you look forward to a nice walk in the park, Hyde Park is around 5 minutes south. Just a few blocks away are some of the fancier hotels, with prices to match, so for this location, the Days Inn is a bargain. Plenty of food options in the area. There is a little sound in the rooms, but not enough to be disruptive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:14:38.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
