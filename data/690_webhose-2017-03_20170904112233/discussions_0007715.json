The staff was super friendly, the room was clean /luxurious / efficient. The bars and restaurants were great too as was our view of the city. The Korean Deli on the corner is a huge amenity for the hotel too with everything you could imagine and we'll look forward to returning to our new favorite hotel in NYC very soon.
