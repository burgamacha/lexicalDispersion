The hotel is located only a short walk from the metro, and it is surrounded by an abundance of lovely restaurants and little bakeries. Malesherbes was the perfect Parisian area for our first trip to Paris. The staff couldn't be more friendly, helpful and accommodating, and we felt so at home because of this. The room was brilliantly clean, a perfect size for us, a very comfortable bed and the bathroom was excellent. The decor was a perfect blend of modern and a traditional Parisian style. We were so impressed with our stay here and would return again in a heartbeat. It was the cherry on top to a perfect break away to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:56:50.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
