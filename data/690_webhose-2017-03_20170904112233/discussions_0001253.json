We were there for 7 nights and room was cleaned brilliantly everyday. Room was not huge but fine for us as we were out exploring most of the time, great shower. Very safe area with lots of bars and resturants round about, favourites were AWOL bar on the corner and Eisenbergs sandwich shop beside Flatiron building. Subway very close and could go uptown or downtown very quickly and safely. View from floor 10 lounge of Empire state was great with complimentary tea & coffee a really nice touch especially on the day we had the snowstorm. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it is perfectly positioned to explore Manhattan yet far enough away from the madness of uptown, all the resturants round about were very reasonable compared to uptown prices. Free wi-fi in lounge only but as we didn't have a good view from our room anyway it was fine.\nRoom Tip: Try and get a room higher up ours was on 6th floor See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:25:00.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
