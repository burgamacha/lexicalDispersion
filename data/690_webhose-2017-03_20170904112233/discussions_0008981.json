The food was good and the service, while a little slow, was very friendly and welcoming.\nThe food was lovely but, I must admit, I still didn't feel as though the 'refuel breakfast' I had was worth Â£26.00. I work in Soho and often eat out nearby and I think that is by far the most I have paid for a full English yet!\nThat said, I didn't stay as a hotel guest and, judging by the lovely decor, the higher prices are probably indicative of the overall experience.
