We were able to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the cruise terminal through the assistance of the hotel and everything worked out smoothly. The staff are very friendly and they give you a map with points of interest. The breakfast had many choices and was very enjoyable. We stayed in two different rooms and both were decorated beautifully with great views. The location was excellent and the popular tourist sites were a short walk away. I highly recommend this hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:42:24.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
