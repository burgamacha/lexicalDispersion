It is in a fantastic location for the Hall - literally 3 mins walk around the corner. It is a pretty and characterful hotel. As someone already mentioned, unfortunately restoration works are in progress at the moment, so there is scaffolding all over the building. However, we did not hear any noise that we are aware of, from the works.\nThe staff were extremely welcoming and we were given a lovely room (111). A great size with a large very comfortable king size bed (we had paid for a premium room), lovely furnishings, drapes and chandelier. The bathroom was also large and very characterful with a 'wooden throne toilet'! Tea and coffee facilities are provided, but unfortunately not water. This we had to use from the mini bar at a cost of Â£3 per bottle.\nAlthough we did not use the bar or restaurant, they both looked very nice and I would imagine breakfast would have been good. The only negative as far as we were concerned was the noise from other rooms. We could hear other people - probably above us and there was often noise of running water passing down the pipes in the walls. Together with bright light coming from under the door all night, it made it difficult to sleep. My husband also complained of some kind of compressor noise out side, although I didn't hear this myself.\nAll in all, a nice hotel though and I would consider staying again if we were visiting another concert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:33:48.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
