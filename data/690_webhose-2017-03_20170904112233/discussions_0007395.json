This is our fourth stay in a Citadines and we love the aparthotel concept so much that we won't stay in any other when in London. Out of the four times weve stayed there we've had our room upgraded twice and this time we were upgraded to a one bed apartment from our deluxe room booking which was a lovely gesture and experience. We even had the option of a smartphone to use as we wanted but didn't need to need to as we have our own. So it was quiet, clean and amazing as ever. No sneaking wine past the concierge as its greatly encouraged to bring supplies in. So we love the citadines and will always stay in one if we can", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:52:24.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
