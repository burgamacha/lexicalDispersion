We were pleased to see that the location of the hotel is very close to times sq and within walking distance to Central Park & Rockefeller and Empire State. We barely had to get transport!\nGreat location with some good restaurants around & the breakfast was ideal for something quick! The room was lovely and equipped with everything we needed, although we wasn't in the room much!\nDefinitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to do the tourist bits of NYC as it is very close to everything!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:18:10.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
