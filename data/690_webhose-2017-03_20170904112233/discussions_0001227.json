It is literally only a 5 minute walk from the train station. Our family of 4 booked two connecting rooms as there was no option for all four of us to be in one room. We were given a suite of two rooms, each with its own bathroom, connected by a foyer. It was lovely. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spotless. We were on the first floor, which was very convenient as we could take the beautiful granite stairs down to the lobby and breakfast instead of waiting for an elevator. The hotel restaurant is run by Eataly. The breakfast buffet was included with the room and was very good. There are two subway stops within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. It was easy to take the subway to the Vatican and Spanish Steps. The Colosseum was a 20 minute walk as was the Pantheon. Front desk staff were very helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:28:47.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
