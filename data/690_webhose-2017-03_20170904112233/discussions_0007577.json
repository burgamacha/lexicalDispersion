Turns out there was no need. I am always sceptical about the positive reviews after reading negatives, thinking they few positive reviews must be fake. I had a great experience! Every shower was very hot within seconds, bed was firm (not hard) with no saggy soft areas. Elevator was fine. Only time I had to wait longer than 1 minute was on my last morning at 10am when everyone else was also waiting! Even then it was only 5mins . there was a sign up saying the elevators where being updated. Room was very clean. No mould, tub had a little peeling enamel but hey, this is a tub that gets used/cleaned everyday and has been in use for how long? Room was small and had no tea/coffee etc but I knew this as it is clearly stated on the website. I needed a clean, safe, central location to sleep and shower. This room was perfect. My first night I bought a drink back to my room only to realise I needed a bottle opener. I left a note for house keeping to say they could have the drink as I didn't have an opener. That night when I came back there was an opener! Above and beyond! Staff were all very nice to me. I would stay again. When I first got out of lift on 9th floor, the first thing that popped into my head was 'OMG I'm in the shinning!', due to the quietness and long halls! I sent my husband a pic and he laughed! I was the only one in this King superior room but would be fine for a couple. Thanks for a great accommodation Roosevelt!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:25:08.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
