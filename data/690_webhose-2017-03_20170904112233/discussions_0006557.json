From our room you could see the Eiffel Tower (looked incredible at night). There is the BEST bakery next door and a park opposite where you can enjoy a croissant and coffee in the morning.\nThe hotel rooms were clean, stylish and comfortable.\nI would 100% stay here again. A special shout out to Maonna - a staff member who was incredibly cheery and made our stay extra special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:43:14.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
