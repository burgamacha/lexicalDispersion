The size of the room was perfect for what we needed and the beds are among the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The breakfast had ample selection and was one of the better I've encountered at a Comfort Inn. The staff was top notch and made this stay that much better. Very well located close to several restaurants and a Rite-Aid. Also right down the street from the F train which is only a 10 minute subway ride from Times Square. I cannot wait to stay here again and this will always be my go to hotel in NYC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:34:09.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
