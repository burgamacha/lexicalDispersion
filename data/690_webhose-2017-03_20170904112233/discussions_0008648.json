The inn is at the back of tesco supermarket down the wide cobbled pathway. Quick self service check in but staff are on hand if needed.\nLifts available giving access to bedrooms all key security to lifts and bedroom corridors. Large room with double bed and usual Premier Inn amenities. Hanging space with around 6 hangers. Hairdryer and plenty of sockets. Very quiet and no noise could be heard. Our room had a view of the Shard.\nBreakfast is served off reception in the small bar area. A good selection of self service goodies. It's small but there us an area upstairs to sit as well. There is a limited bar at this Inn probably because of its location near to some nice pubs and bars.\nAn ideal base for around the Shard and a 20 minute walk to St Paul's Cathedral would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:39:53.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
