Bathroom is a little tight and shower head is not removable but not really a big deal. It is near everything - shopping, lots of great restos, and subway.\nLobby is huge and perfect for entertaining large groups of friends. Elevators do not need key cards to go up to your floor.\nStaff were really friendly and accommodating. Theyre very considerate and always lending a helping hand. Housekeeping did a great job in keeping my room neat and organized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:27:36.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
