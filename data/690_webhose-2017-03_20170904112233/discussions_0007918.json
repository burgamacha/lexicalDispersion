The worst part about the London is its restaurant/bar. The guest rooms were nicely upscale -- all decent-sized suites -- high-end but not over the top lovely, and the service was helpful yet unobtrusive.\nWe booked through the AMEX Fine Hotels program which includes breakfast for two and a $100 food and beverage credit per stay, but at the London it's not a great deal. The London limits the AmEX breakfast inclusion to its \"buffet\" which is no better than you'd get at a basic budget hotel (the vat of eggs, greasy bacon, basic fruit salad and muffins, etc.) Order off the menu and you pay full freight -- and the menu is pretty basic fare as well, served in a dining room that looks like an old diner, with service that you'd expect at an old diner. The same space doubles as the London's all-day restaurant and evening \"bar,\" but it's not an elegant place to dine nor is it a trendy, chic, fun place to get a drink.\nMy advice: if you get a good rate on a high-floor suite (they have great views, especially for that part of town), take it. You won't be disappointed, especially if your dining needs are being met elsewhere. But don't bother taking advantage of the AMEX Fine Hotels rate, and don't pay top dollar to stay at the London. It's a nice place but not for top dollar.\nRoom Tip: Upgrade to a high floor for the best views.
