The room and a very nice cooked English breakfast for GBP 70. The room was nice and practical. In the bathroom no shampoo or body lotion, but tea and coffee available in the room. Room clean and fresh and good wifi. Restaurant had a special meal offer at a reasonable rate. The food was tasty and service good. Hotel staff friendly. The building does not look attractive, but inside the hotel was modern, clean and functional. Very recommendable.\nRoom Tip: Dinner and breakfast both good value.
