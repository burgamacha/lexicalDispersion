In addition I've never stayed in a room this small. I believe the rooms are between 140-200 sqft. Makes sense for the real estate prices in NYC. But don't let the small room fool you, they are clean and have plenty of attention to detail. The washroom is essentially inside a closet, crammed with a sink, shower and toilet. (I would have to say you would have a hard time getting comfy in there if you were taller than 6\"4 or more than 300lbs.\nReally enjoyed my stay, I believe there needs to be more hotels like this. Really comfy beds are all you need as you should be put exploring the city.\nWill definitely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:56:16.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
