It is a few blocks east of Times Square and the Theater District and a short walk from the shops of Fifth Avenue. Its rooms are comfortable, clean and well-kept. The staff that I encountered while staying there – from housekeeping to bell staff and front desk – were all friendly, efficient and welcoming. The hotel’s location is a short walk to many tourist attractions. However, it is far enough away that it is rather quiet, a welcome break from the noise and bustle of the City.\nOn the whole, I enjoyed my stay at the Iroquois. I certainly will consider it for future visits to New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:12:25.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
