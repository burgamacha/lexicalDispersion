And to say I was extremely impressed would not be an exaggeration.\nThe property was gorgeous and well kept, considering the snow storm that had covered the sidewalks just the day before. The location was ideal, close to a local stop on a main train line. Popular area in Manhattan were within walking distance.\nThe room and bathroom were smaller than I thought they'd be, but even so they were still gorgeous. The amenities were a nice quality as well! I was only a little disappointed that toothbrushes and toothpaste weren't provided for free, but that didn't matter in the long run. It was easy enough to procure it elsewhere for a cheaper price.\nThe front desk staff were helpful and cheery.\nOverall, should I choose to do a staycation again, I will definitely have to stay at the Roger again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:35:01.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
