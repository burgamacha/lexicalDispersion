I'm only here one night and wanted to be near St Pancras, which is a three minute walk away. Very convenient. My room is expectedly small but exceptionally clean. The small toilet/shower area is like new, the carpet looks new and my bed is comfortable. The tiny sink is slightly in the way of the toilet, I am six feet tall and 215 pounds so the sink issue isn't a huge problem, just a very slight inconvenience. The hotel staff were very accommodating and moved my stored luggage to my room while I was sight seeing. I recommend the Alhambra if you need to be in the St Pancras / Kings Cross area of London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:18:55.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
