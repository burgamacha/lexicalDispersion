The staff were helpful and polite, I left my phone charger behind and they were kind enough to post it back, no extra charge. The continental breakfast was fantastic, great choice, with cooked available at extra cost. However with the choice of breads, toasts, fruit, cheese, meats, pastries, juices, yoghurts etc, there was no need for us to have anything else. The hotel is very close to lots of excellent restaurants, so you can walk down round the Gloucester rd tube and take your pick. Also the museums are a very short walk away. We were given a glass of complimentary prosecco every evening in the bar. Also the bar has cheap drinks available between 6.30-8, which includes beer at £2 and wine £2.50 a glass or a cocktail at £3.50 which is superb value for London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:13:48.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
