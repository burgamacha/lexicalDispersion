There were quite a few of us, so we had a set menu. Despite there only being two courses and two choices, I still had trouble deciding. My starter was a Superfood Salad. It was beautiful, pretty to look at and a delight to eat. My main course was the bass. My bass was a really decent size and cooked to perfection. I suspected the kitchen had a bit of a nightmare somewhere but nobody else noticed. Service was good, although the lack of fluent English by some of the waiters meant that we got things we didn't want and didn't get exactly what we asked for. Having said that, nobody starved or dehydrated so all good. I will definitely come back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:54:33.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
