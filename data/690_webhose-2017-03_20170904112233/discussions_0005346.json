There is also plenty of restaurants and bars in the area which was perfect as we were out late sight seeing but could still get back have a rest then get dressed up to get a lovley meal.\nThe hotel itself was lovely, quite small making it a more intimate experience and very boutique with its glamorous decoration.\nThe we had a classic room but it was still a good size and had very comfy bed which was great for a good night's sleep after a busy day of sightseeing. Our room was on the 7th floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower and I enjoyed watching it glisten at night.\nThe staff were very pleasant and attentive.\nThe room was also very affordable, we booked the room though hotels.com so may have got discounted rates but the quality of the hotel experience outdid our expectations and I would definitely come back on another trip to Paris.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:24:45.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
