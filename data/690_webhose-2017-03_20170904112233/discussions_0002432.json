Stayed here for 5 days, there's only 1 Evian water as compliments, but 2nd day onwards no refill, is this normal? Aside from that, room is clean and very quiet.\nBreakfast was the same everyday, but there's plenty of food choices in that breakfast buffet corner, and has a nespresso coffee machine to fulfill my morning coffee needs.\nIt's about 5-15 minutes walk to 2 office buildings where I had my meetings at, and it's about 8 minutes walk to nearest metro station, so quite convenient. As it's in the residential area, so no taxi station nearby, you'll need to ask the hotel staff to help you call taxi.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:56:34.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
