We had a junior suite for 2 nights shopping and site seeing. Room was on 6th floor facing the Square and generously proportioned with an excellent bathroom, walk in shower and separate bath. Very quiet at this higher level - be aware currently there is construction work next to the hotel though we were not disturbed. Reception and concierge staff very warm and helpful. Breakfast was included in our package and was hearty and substantial. Did not stay for a dinner so cannot comment - too many other restaurants very close by. Location is a huge plus, 2 minutes to Leicester Square tube, 2 minutes to Chinatown, 3 minutes to the Theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, 4 minutes to Piccadilly Circus tube and the shopping on Regent Street, 5 minutes to Covent Garden. Pricing was very fair I thought for a London hotel - I have stayed in more luxurious London hotels but also paid far more. Will definately consider staying again.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors quieter better views.
