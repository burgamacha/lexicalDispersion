The hotel is located in a wonderful area tucked away from the busy Oxford street. The hotel staff made a great first impression with welcoming my wife and I with a glass of prosecco upon check in. We were upgraded to club lounge access with our deluxe double room for our stay which made our stay even more enjoyable with breakfast and evening cocktails before heading out to town.\nAdella and the guest service team went the extra mile for us as we were personally escorted to our room with upon entrance rose petals of Happy B Day for my wife as well as a knock on the door was a delivery of a slice of cake and a bottle of prosecco! This was a fantastic treat for my wife and left a wonderful memory of our first day in London.\nOur room was well kept and had everything we needed for the duration of our stay. If we needed anything, all we had to do was ask. The Montcalm team knows how to treat their guests and we will definitely recommend this great hotel due to its staff, location, and amenities.\nThanks so much again to the outstanding staff of the Montcalm for making our first trip to London a very memorable one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:51:49.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
