There were no details given about the breakfast on the website i booked and the front desk did not give any details during my check-in. There is no buffet so you order from the menu , first day we ordered whatever we normally eat in the breakfast without checking any price on the menu and the waitress or the manager in the restaurant didnt inform about details as well , she told me you that write your room no and you are ok. I received the check and wrote my room number on it. But i wanted check again with reception so i finally find out that it is limited with 37usd per person per day. They didn't charged me the extra as i called the booking website but i was expecting a personal apologize but nobody showed up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:17:39.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
