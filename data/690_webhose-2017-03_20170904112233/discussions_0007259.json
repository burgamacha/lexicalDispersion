The location is so central that we only used the tube getting to and from the station on our arrival and departure. All the staff that we had interaction were genuinely friendly and helpful.\nThe room was bright and light with interesting and unusual \"mood\" lighting which was fun. The aircon was easy to adjust so enabling a cool room to sleep in. The bed was large and super comfortable with crisp white cotton bedlinen and plenty of soft, sumptuous pillows. The shower wins our \"hotel shower of the year\" award - it is rare to get a hotel shower that even matches the one we have at home - this one really ticked the box! Another plus point for anyone who likes to dry their hair after showering, the hairdryer was a 'proper' hairdryer, there was a large mirror with a socket next to the mirror. Double USB sockets on each side of the bed for charging the multitude of small electronic devices that we all seem to be slaves to, along with more by the desk.\nWe enjoyed a cocktail in The Blindspot before going out to eat in the evening - very friendly service, lovely cocktails and the serving of deep fried calamari that we had to \"put us on\" till dinner was to be highly recommended!\nAll in all, this hotel ticks all the boxes for us, we will definitely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:24:49.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
