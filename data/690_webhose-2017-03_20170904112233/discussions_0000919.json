We couldn't have been more pleased. The place, itself, was clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The people who worked there were happy, friendly and more than helpful.\nThe breakfast, included in our stay was excellent. There were a couple of times during our week, that we had to leave the hotel before breakfast was served at 7AM. We notified the desk this would be the case, and there was a box breakfast waiting for us as we left, When we return to Rome, we sill stay in this hotel again!\nLastly, the location of this hotel is prefect. It is located in a pleasant neighborhood, on the Via de Palermo, 15 minutes walk from the Coliseum and a 10 minutes walk from Rome's Termini Station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:46:26.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
