The location is excellent, only a 5 minute walk from Paddington station, which is where the Heathrow Express arrives so you can be from the airport to your hotel in less than half an hour. It is also on the edge of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful and was willing to go extra lengths to make our trip successful. The bar downstairs was really great and they have excellent cocktails and bartending staff.\nThe only downside is the super tiny room. Even by European standards, I would say this room was small. They packed it with too much furniture so you could not even move around the bed. Two people could not be standing and moving at once, someone had to be in the bathroom or on the bed out of the way. If you want to stay ere, I would pay for an upgraded room. Otherwise, we loved it here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:48:36.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
