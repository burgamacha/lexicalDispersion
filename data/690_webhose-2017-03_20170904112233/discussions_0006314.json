AWESOME LOCATION! Just 2 short blocks from Times Square and all of the great shopping. Also close to shopping on 34th street and Madison Square Garden. There is a subway station where you can get on the A/C/E, 1/2/3, N/Q/R right on 40th and 8th (half a block away from the hotel). The great bar Sky Room is right next door.\nUpon arrival, we were greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. The staff was great and check-in was quick. The room was also in pristine condition. Beds were neatly made, sheets were stain free. Ample face, hand and body towels available. Bathroom was nice and clean as well with quality free toiletries. We were on the 16th floor and the elevator was still quick. When we did have a question, the staff at the front desk was able to answer quickly and effectively. Only downfall: ice and vending machines are all the way in the basement level of the hotel. It would be nice to have an ice machine on a couple floors. However, the elevator worked well so it really wasnt a problem. I would definitely stay here again!\nRoom Tip: choose a room away from the elevators. Some times people are loud getting on and off See more room tips Green Features: $5 food/drink voucher for not requesting changing of linens and towels every day!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:01:05.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
