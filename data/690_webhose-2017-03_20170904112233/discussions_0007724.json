Thank you Elizabeth, Carlos & Zack. You guys rock!\nI want to let everyone know the experience was welcoming and comfortable beds and beautiful newly designed hotel and restaurant has delicious menu and variety of drinks. The music was on point and what a hidden gem. This is my \"new spot\" when I am visiting NYC. Location is also convenient.\nThank you I hope to see you guys soon...\nDalle G\nRoom Tip: Higher floors better views of NYC Panorama See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:57:37.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
