The room cost was reasonable being in such a convenient location. You can basically walk anywhere that should be of interest. The bed is extremely comfortable. The room is well laid out with an excellent HD TV. The room is clean, has a safe and a convenient small fridge. Missing was the tea/coffee maker. There is no parking on site and it is a bit inconvenient to have to take two elevators, one to get to lobby and another to get to the rooms. I did not use fitness room or restaurants but the prices seemed reasonable for a hotel or should I say New York prices are so high that hotel prices seem reasonable. One think I hated was being charged another extra $10 a day tax charge that came out of nowhere. I was told \"Welcome to New York\" by the front staff apologetically. I already paid like another 5 surcharges.
