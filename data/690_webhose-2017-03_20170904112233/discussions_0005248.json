Everything, from check-in to luggage delivery, to meeting our butler to check-out went very smoothly. Each floor has the St. Regis Butler Service. Shoe shining, shirt pressing, coffee service at check-in and each morning is just a phone call away. Our butler was fast, efficient and very friendly. The house car is a Bentley, which we didn't get to experience because it was in the shop. A Mercedes took it's place and it was always away when we wanted to get a ride. It would be helpful if you could schedule a ride in advance. Even in the winter the central location made walking everywhere easy to do. If you are using points, as we did, remember you can get your 5th night free on any Cat 3 and above hotel. The St. Regis NY is a Cat. 7. Had I know that we'd have taken advantage of it. Overall, a great experience.\nRoom Tip: We had a 3rd floor room and road noise was obvious some mornings.
