Very clean and very modern with touch screens above your bed on either side, to adjust lighting and air conditioning which in my eyes is amazing! Nice size bathroom with a really good shower! Very friendly staff and very welcoming reception!\nAmazing location right next to the truemens brewery and only a stones throw away from the nearest tube station!\nOnly thing that I found a little annoying was that you had to scan your room card to operate the lift, but would 1 % recommend stopping here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:26:14.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
