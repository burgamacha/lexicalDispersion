I booked a city view room. I booked directly through the Hilton website as this was the cheapest option. My partner then emailed asking if they could do anything to make our trip extra special and they upgraded our room to a corner room on the 30th floor with a view of the Empire State Building - it was awesome! The views were great. The room was spacious and had a large bed, TV, chest of drawers, desk, swivel chair, lounge chair, fridge, hanging space for clothes, safe and a nice sized bathroom. The bathroom came with a small selection of toiletries.\nThe location of the hotel was perfect - walking distance to Times Square, lots of cafes restaurants within 10 mins walk. The subway as just outside the front of the hotel (Herald Sq) and Penn Station was 5 mins walk down the street.\nMy partner had also requested a few extras to be in our room on arrival - A bunch of roses (it was Valentines day just after my birthday) and also a bottle of wine. The hotel were happy to accommodate such requests and charged accordingly.\nWe ate breakfast out each day - didn't want to miss the great New York brunches and breakfasts so we didn't use the dining room.\nSome people have mentioned the lifts - there are three in the centre of the hotel with the rooms on each floor surrounding them - We could hear them slightly in our room but not enough to disturb us.\nWe had free WIFI in our room and this was a reasonable speed.\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to New York.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:31:01.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
