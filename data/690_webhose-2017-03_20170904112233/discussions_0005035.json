Off the main road but very close to amenities.\nThe rooms are snug, but still plenty of room to move around.\nThe staff were polite and welcoming and their spoken English was brilliant. Had to pay city tax when we checked out which was minimal at â‚¬9.70 in total for 2 people. We already knew this so wasn't a surprise.\nThe breakfast was basic but of good quality. The choice was a selection of mini pastries, cereal, toast, fruit and yoghurt.\nThe metro was a few minutes walk from the hotel which is ideal for site seeing. Along the main roads were plenty of shops and restaurants.\nThe only downfall was that there wasn't tea and coffee facilities in the room, however on our last day saw a sign on reception saying you could purchase a hot drink for a couple of euros. Also, a homeless man had set up camp outside the hotel (I mean armchair the lot) and he could be quite vocal at times!\nThe wifi was excellent which is a bonus.\nWould definitely stay in this hotel again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:16:01.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
