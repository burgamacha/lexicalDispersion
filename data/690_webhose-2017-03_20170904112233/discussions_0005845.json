We booked the Deluxe room because we wanted the extra space. We loved the location of this hotel, right next to the Pompidou, walking distance to the Seine, and near at least three different Metro lines. The room is ultra modern and cool. I LOVED the stars in the shower. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had some interesting requests because we are sabbath observers and they graciously complied. There is not enough drawer space in the Deluxe room. I ended up using the couch as a shelf. The elevator only goes up to the 5th floor, so we had to walk one flight. Not a big deal for myself, but I could imagine it could be difficult from someone handicap. Finally, on the top floor there are three sky lights but no window looking to the street. I found it cozy, but if you are expecting a view you will be disappointed.\nOverall, I highly recommend this hotel. We booked on Hotels.com and got a 10% discount. Not sure how but no complaints since it left us more money to buy croissants!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:23:57.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
