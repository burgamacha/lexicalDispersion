I brought my 17 year old daughter for spring break where we spent five nights at The Knick. The location is prime as it's in Times Square. The rooftop bar has a view that overlooks the square along with the famous NYE ball. Happy hour starts at 4:00 with a great menu and a DJ that plays starting at 5:30 (each night was different). We had a city view room with two queens. The rooms was stocked with everything you could need, including high end toiletries, complimentary umbrella, daily newspaper, slippers and robe. Oh, and black-out blinds! The Staff was hands down a \"10\" from check-in to each time we stepped in and out of the hotel. The price was reasonable compared to others in the same area. Hotel is close to subway and taxi's are a dime a dozen. The only con was there was no coffee in the room - they do, however, have a cafe on the first floor. Will definitely be back!\nRoom Tip: All rooms have blackout blinds to ensure a good nights sleep!
