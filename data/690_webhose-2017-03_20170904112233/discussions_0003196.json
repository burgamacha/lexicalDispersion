There are several great restaurants within a short walk of the hotel.\nThe staff were all very friendly and helpful and all that we interacted with spoke English well.\nThe rooms are pretty small, which is to be expected in Paris, but plan accordingly. We had two large suitcases and it was hard to find space to open them both up. The closet was too small to really utilize much.\nThe hotel is very nice with beautiful finishes everywhere. My only problem with the hotel is overall it's very small. There is a small bar just off the lobby and then I believe a restaurant just off the lobby as well. The restaurant was closed due to renovation while we were there so we didn't get to see that.\nI was under the impression this hotel had a concierge lounge but when we got there found out it did not. As a platinum member I get breakfast included at the lounge or included at the restaurant if there's no lounge. With the restaurant closed and no lounge we didn't get breakfast; they did add 750/day points to my account, but that does not equate to the $30/day we had to spend on breakfast.\nOverall I enjoyed this hotel, but with all the Marriott properties in the vicinity I will probably try some others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:14:08.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
