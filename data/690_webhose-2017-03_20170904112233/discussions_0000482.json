But all of sudden they cancel the reservation without telling the reason why. So i had to call the call centre in Spain to have them rebooked me the room even at a slightly higher price, which wasnt a problem. The correpondence with Paola from the Melia Vendome was helpful.\nLocAtion was great. Right in the shopping area with lots of great restaurants.\nChecking in was fast, easy\nThe first impression of the lobby was nicely decorated and cozy.\nBellboy was friendly and helpful.\nRoom: decent size for parisian standard, along with water kettle, safe deposit box . Minibar. The room was warm, so had to open the window\nSomehow the fire alarm was covered with plastic wrap. And the ceiling cracked.\nbathroom pretty spacious bathtub and all.\nBreakfast: hotel standard, egg stations, cold cuts, fruits and juice. Milk and cereals also breads. However the staffs seemed tired and not excited in serving the guests.\nMajor let down: WIFI. Dont count on it. Super slow. I mean slow even slower than in rural third world country i went .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:45:31.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
