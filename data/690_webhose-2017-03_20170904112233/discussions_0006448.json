Room nicely sized- I think some others are a bit tight- with smooth contemporary fittings, nothing too flash. Both bath and walk in shower. Aircon/heating & Wifi worked well. Very quiet overlooking the tranquil square. Bed comfy, sheets a little itchy (??). My room was quite a long walk from the central lift. Bar & facilities very agreeable, with the option of sitting outside. Good breakfast too. Only issue for me was that it's completely functional but a bit soulless. Location was key for me- just 4 mins from my destination. So I'll gladly use it again when I'm in the same part of town", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:06:21.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
