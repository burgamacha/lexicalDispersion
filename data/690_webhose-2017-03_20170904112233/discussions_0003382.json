The hotel is placed in the outskirts of the city centre, but pretty well connected with Metro. The area is nearby Paris St. Germain's stadium and looks really calm during nights. From the beginning the Reception team was helpful, bearing in mind that we were 10 talking at the same time in different languages, I now realize how patience they were :-) When we arrived to the rooms, we found clean and well equipped rooms. Perhaps 6-7 years old, but very well maintained. No noise from the outside, although our windows face the roadway. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Two facts that popped from the beginning: we were missing a couple of extra plugs in the walls to connect our batteries and a \"tall\" bathtube , not very easy to get in or out for small or obese people. The breakfast was very good, from the greetingfull staff until the presentation of the buffet or the variety of breads and bakery, that we really appreciate. Perhaps, since we were so many we realize that find a round table for 10 is difficult ! :-D\nWe were the whole day out, sightseeing, so no idea about how the food at the restaurant was; but out experience was truly good and we left the hotel and Paris with a smile on our faces.\nRoom Tip: Comfortable beds and noise blocking windows See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:42:16.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
