Perfectly located near Waterloo station and right by the London Eye.\nThe view from the room was a great view of the London Eye and Big Ben.\nThe location was great and right by Waterloo station so links to London underground and National Rail.\nThere is a free to use bag store for before or after you check out if you need it.\nWould stop here again when visiting London and would use Premier Inn again around the country.\nRoom Tip: Higher floor for better views.
