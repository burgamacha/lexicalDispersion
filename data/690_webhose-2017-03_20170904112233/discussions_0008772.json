The extra tax of $33 dollars a night is a bit much. When booking a hotel you would normally pay the fixed fee for the duration, not an additional fee when checking out.\nI also rang the hotel a couple of weeks beforehand because it was my boyfriend's special birthday and requested a bottle of bubbly in the room. There was no bubbly, and on arrival only then found out that the hotel did not actually have room service. So a bit disappointing on a couple of points.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a higher floor, much quieter See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:58:47.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
