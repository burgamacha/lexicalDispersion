Great design , A1 security , high standards , accommodating team members on front desk & breakfast service.\nNo parking & not easy to get car to the front of the hotel but easy access from drop off access on high street. Proximity to Borough market itself - exceptional.\nValue for money in London - good. Value for money in the real world - not so good but still very competitive in the overall mid market hotel sector as the quality Premier Inn offering continues to exceed expectations.\nIf you need English breakfast - no problem @ all & don't be shy on asking for more etc\nWorth trying out if in the district", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:39:34.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
