I've stayed at the Bryant Park hotel several times and each stay is wonderful; superb staff, front desk (especially Nikki) and concierge Kareem gracious and professional. Housekeeping, cleanliness excellent with evening turn-down service available. Door staff gracious, friendly and rapid. Located within 5 minute walk to Broadway theatres and Times Square with several subway and bus routes nearby. If you have particular requests, call ahead to the front desk-reservations and they will definitely try to accomodate you. Excellent value, worth the treat!\nRoom Tip: Best views face Bryant Park, quieter facing south.
