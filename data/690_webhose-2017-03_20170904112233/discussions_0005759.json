Awesome vibe with calming chill music wafting through the lobby and lifts.\nLoved the staff at the front desk, always so welcoming regardless of time of day and the exclusive shower products were amazing (I bought some from their small \"shop\" area).\nEasy walk to almost all areas with access to all conveniences on every corner close by plus subway.\nRooms were adequate in size, stayed in a deluxe city king view room.\nMore space for luggage would have topped it off. Restaurant dinner was pricey but decent.\nNice to stay in a fresh, modern and trendy hotel at a great price for NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:32:07.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
