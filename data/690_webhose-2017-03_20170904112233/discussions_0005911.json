It is located a two minute walk from the Richiilue Drouot metro stop and also the Opera House stop which can bring you to the Eiffel Tower and Marne-La-Vallee(Disneyland). You can walk to the Louvre within ten minutes and another ten minutes further you will reach the Champs Elysees.\nBreakfast in the hotel is also very nice. Fresh pastries, cereals, fruit, coffee etc. are all available each morning until 10:30am which sets you up for the day.\nWe availed of the Spa access twice on our stay and are disappointed we didn't do it four times as it was that great. There is a steam room and large jacuzzi type pool with herbal tea and water provided.\nThere are a number of bars and restaurants located nearby that cater for many cuisines. (Italian, Indian etc.) and there is also a McDonalds and Chipotle around the corner for those who require fast food during the day.\nWhen we visit Paris again we will definitely be staying at Hotel Saint-Marc. It is definitely worth it.\nRoom tip: We were located on the side of the hotel on the first floor. It was a little noisy at approximately 8:00am Sunday morning and 05:00 Tuesday morning. We were unsure of where the music was coming from but it sounded like an apartment or hall nearby. It may be best to request a room higher up or a courtyard view room but don't let this stop you from booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:40:21.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
