The staff is wonderful, especially Xena and Indigo, and the hotel is just great. It is new, clean, modern, and in a great location. The Library, the Blond, and the conference / meeting rooms are all wonderful venues for eating, drinks or a gathering. I would highly recommend for New Yorkers looking for a staycation or for those visiting New York. We were in two different rooms - one on 10 and one on the PH floor and both were wonderful. We had an especially great view on the higher PH floor facing east.\nRoom Tip: make sure you are on a higher floor, you don't want the noise of The Blond See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:02:06.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
