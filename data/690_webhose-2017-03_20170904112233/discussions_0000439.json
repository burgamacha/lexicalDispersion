The hotel itself is lovely but the staff are the ones who make it extra special. We arrived extremely early as we had an appointment yet we were told that our room may have been ready once we returned from said appointment &, if not, that we would be able to have club lounge access while we waited. This was the case so we enjoyed the club lounge facilities & then the member of staff we spoke to earlier came to the lounge to inform us the room was ready & then proceeded to show us to our lovely, beautifully scented room (we had previously had a message asking us which in room scent we would like, along with pillow menu).\nOnce checked out & having left, we noticed that we had left our train tickets in our room. A quick phone call to the hotel explaining the situation led to them phoning us in less than 5 minutes stating that the tickets were secure & could be collected when we returned for our luggage that they were holding.\nOverall, a lovely hotel with fantastic staff in a great location in London. We would certainly recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:52:36.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
