What a quaint little hotel located on the 3rd floor of an old building! It had an antique lift (big enough for 2 people and some luggage), rooms were clean and spacious, and the beds were very firm (to our liking). Breakfast was nothing to shout about, but good enough for anyone to start the day - nice cup of coffee / cappuccino, juice, pastries, cereal and some fruits. The hotel was very conveniently located for us to walk to some of the major sights, including lots of Basilicas. We were very pleased with our stay and for the very reasonable price, it totally met our expectations. We will definitely stay here again when we next return to Rome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:32:46.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
