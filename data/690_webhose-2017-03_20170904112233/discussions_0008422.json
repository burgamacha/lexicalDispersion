Although there was a line to check in when I arrived, I was made to feel welcome. My room was small but clean, and on the back side of the hotel as I had requested (quieter). The bed was super comfortable. I was on the 5th floor, which meant I could easily take the stairs if the elevators were slow (a frequent problem). I appreciated the friendly staff and the convenient location.
