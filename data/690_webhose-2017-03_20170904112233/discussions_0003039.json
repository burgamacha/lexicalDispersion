It was great from all perspectives: comfort, location, charm, friendliness, breakfast... It is a charming little place, very close to 2 metro stops, and thus within a short ride to all main attractions. The neighborhood is safe, still pretty touristy, but with a variety of good restaurants where you would also see many locals. Rooms are very cute and clean. They are on rather small side, but provide a lot of storage space, so you don't have to trip over your luggage. Design is very pretty and provides for a charming holiday atmosphere, seems to be freshly done. Bathroom had a large shower and modern design. Staff was great and spoke very well english. Breakfast had moderate choice, but food was very fresh and coffee tasted good ;). We could not have made a better choice really!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T22:00:56.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
