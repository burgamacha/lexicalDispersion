I've been previously to NYC many times and stayed in different hotels but this one is my favourite. I chose it because, being from Croatia, wanted to stay in the place where famous scientist Nikola Tesla stayed for the last 10 years of his life (1933-1943). He was btw born in Croatia. The room in question is 3327 and his study was 3328. I asked at the reception if I might be allowed to enter briefly the room. Not only I was granted that but the lovely receptionist upgraded me free of charge to spend the night in 3327! Great ending of my RTW trip! Thank you so much!\nThe location of this hotel is superb - you are walking distance from the Penn Station, Empire State Building, Times Sq..., and short subway ride away from everything else in the city.\nRoom had big supercomfy bed (at the end I forgot to ask where they get those pillows and linen from, because I would buy the same for my home bed!).\nA", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:44:05.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
