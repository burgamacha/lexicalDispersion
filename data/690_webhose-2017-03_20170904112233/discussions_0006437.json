Also, it was a bit far from the Walthamstow Central Underground, aprox. 15 minutes walk. However, from there you have the Victoria line which takes you in no more than 20 minutes in the city center.\nThe hotel looks very nice and clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room is modern, has new furniture and appliances, good WIFI, comfy bed and also a desk if needed. You have enough space under the bed to place your trolleys, air conditioning is functioning properly and the bathroom is also very nice and clean.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:50:35.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
