Our room was on the Sixth floor and was exceptional - clean, spacious, fresh smelling with 'finishing touches' that (without wanting to spoil the surprise for other guests) were superb!\nWe then went off to spend the day shopping/eating and arrived back around 5pm to nip down to the SPA for a quick leg soak in the Jacuzzi - SO welcome after a day walking around on very tired legs!\nI couldn't recommended this hotel more for a stay in London, the location, staff, rooms, service and 'extra touches' are not something you will find for the same exceptional value anywhere else in town.
