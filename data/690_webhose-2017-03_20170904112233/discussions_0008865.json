The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful, they checked us in quickly and even gave us a map to the local tube stations. The room itself is very small, almost shoebox size but we were fine with that as we weren't in the room that long, The room has a modern design with touch panel controls for the heating/air conditioning easy controllable to your preference, even the lighting has adjustable colours. The rooms have hairdryers, televisions with freeview although disappointingly they have no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but it is available from the downstairs reception again. Just around the corner from the hotel is a few good restaurant chains you can get meals from as well, We would stay here again in the future", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:42:51.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
