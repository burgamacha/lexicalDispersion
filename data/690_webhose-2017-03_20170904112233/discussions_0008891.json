I'd like to particularly call out the front desk manager and concierge, as they went above and beyond their normal call of duty (especially when we forgot a passport in the room!).\nWe stayed 4 nights with two other couples and loved using the parlor rooms as meeting areas or for gathering for a night cap.\nConcierge provided top-shelf service the entire weekend with suggestions, directions and letting us back in the room when we locked ourselves out.\nThe Pelham is beautiful hotel and better yet, first class employees. Also, you can't beat the location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will recommend the Pelham to any friends going abroad to London.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:30:12.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
