Good location near the River and St Paul's cathedral, Tower of London and other attractions. The area away from the river, walking opposite direction from the hotel is not very nice so I would avoid walking around there, specially at night. We had an executive room for 3 people. Two double beds in the room but still felt fairly spacious. Clean room, although top shelves hadn't been dusted nor the glass shelve were the coffee etc was. Good spacious bathroom/ shower. Mini fridge, hair dryer, iron and board and a safe in the room. Comfortable beds and plenty of towels supplied. Nespresso machine in room with 4 complimentary capsules- 2 decaf. Not sure how much the cost is for more but had I known that there was a Nespresso machine in the room I would have brought some with me! The only bad thing I can say is that there is a big lack of atmosphere in the bar/ reception area compared to other hotel I have stayed in. The receptionists are friendly but painfully slow and don't seem to have a lot of local knowledge or sense of direction.\nI probably wouldn't stay here again as there are better choices in London for the same price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:34:33.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
