Clean and nice decor. Lovely to have tea/coffee facilities in the room. Breakfast was also above average for a hotel of this standard in Paris, but they did not refill everything, so less interesting in late morning. The location is also great - quiet, but very close to many dinner options and walking distance from Marais.\nHowever, the internet was close to non-existing in the room. Worked at slow speed in the lobby, but in the room it was impossible to use it. In 2017 you would expected more! We mentioned it to the receptionist at arrival, but little changed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:00:01.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
