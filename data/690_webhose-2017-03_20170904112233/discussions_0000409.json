The service at this hotel is phenomenal - almost everyone speaks very good English and they work very hard to ensure that you have a memorable experience. Our flight arrived early on a Sunday so we walked into the lobby at about 7:00 a.m. They didn't have a room ready yet, so they took our luggage and told us to eat breakfast and relax until they had a room ready for us. When we went back to check, they had already taken our bags up to the room. By the end of the week, the staff working the breakfast knew how we liked our coffee and what kind of juice we usually drank.\nRoom Tip: Rooms on the front of the hotel have a lot of traffic noise See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:40:43.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
