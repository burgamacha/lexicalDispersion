We had a great stay. The reception was welcoming and our daughter loved her warm cookie. Although busy on arrival we were quickly attended to. I pre selected our room on the Hilton honours app and was very impressed with how easy it was, thankfully the man at reception highlighted what a good choice of room we made (248). The breakfast in the lounge was very good, perfect for what we needed with cereals, fruit and some warm food (sausages, bacon and eggs) and plenty of pastries and breads to pick from. We went in the lounge one evening and there was complimentary wine/beers that were regularly stocked as well as snacks available - perfect when travelling with hungry toddlers. The hotel was convenient to angel tube station and a short walk to kings cross, so good location and great base for sightseeing. All in all a fab stay, lovely room, very clean all the great amenities you would expect and we would happily stay here again when coming to London. All the staff we dealt with were courteous and friendly and made the stay very relaxing and enjoyable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:50:05.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
