This hotel is luxurious, friendly, attentive and spotlessly clean. Our vacation begins when we are greeted by Monica and the front desk team. They remember our preferences and go out of their way to provide for everything.\nThe Brasserie Max,located on the first floor, is our go to restaurant. They have arranged birthday parties, dinner parties and,as always, nightly snacks and cocktails. Lena, Flavio and the entire staff take amazing good care of us. They always greet us by name and provide excellent service and good conversation. Flavio has perfected my Martini preferences. Their is no better place for after theater drinks.\nI am happy to report that this wonderful hotel remains our home away from home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:01:02.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
