The bed is really comfortable with lots of pillows and cushions. The room was small but cosy with a shower instead of a bath. I was on the 7th floor and I must say it was really quiet all night so a good night sleep was had. The hotel is very close to the metro however the actual area is not great which is a real shame fine if you are a single guy but a lot of dodgy looking people hanging around. The hotel is great location not so, but then this is reflected in the price if you are planning for a full day in Paris and straight to hotel it's fine but wouldn't hang around the area for drinks etc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:56:05.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
