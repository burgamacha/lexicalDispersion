In addition, I lived in Manhattan for a couple of years. I've stayed all over the City and the Q&A is my new favorite.\nFirst of all, the room is beautiful and enormous by NYC standards. It's clean and has a fully equipped kitchen. While I don't even cook at home, it is nice to have a frig and the ability to whip up a quick breakfast before meetings (There is a small grocer at the corner of Pine Street where you can get anything you need).\nIf you are doing business in the Financial District, you couldn't ask for a better location. You are literally across the street from DB. Also, there are several subway stops that are an easy walk (Rector, Wall Street, WTC).\nFor the tourist, it is perfect. Not only do you have a large space, you are frequently going against the subway traffic (business people are leaving downtown when you are likely returning back) which means no fighting to get on the 6 Train.\nOther great things about staying at the Q&A are:\nThe staff is very helpful and professional\nThere is a lovely coffee shop (the Black Fox) for breakfast in the lobby\nThe gym is beautiful\nThere is a bodega/deli on Pine Street for quick bites as well as a small grocer for staples in your room (I am a sparkling water addict so...)\nSeveral great restaurants in walking distance\nThere is also the Century 21 Dept Store (great designer buys) and TJ Maxx in walking distance in case you forget anything.\nThe only thing I would say that might be a draw back (but you can always get delivery) is that the hotel doesn't have a full service restaurant. However, there are wonderful places in an easy walk.\nAnyway, I highly recommend the Q&A Hotel in NYC. It's my new favorite and I'll definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:27:16.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
