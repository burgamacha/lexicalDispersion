Quite a surprise really. Room was cosy, some would say a bit small. I liked it. Window that opened (though it looked onto the building behind.) Fridge. I just felt at home .A bit hard to find on the street as everyone goes to Number 40 but the entrance seems to be two doors further up.\n24 hour recepton and staff friendly and helpful. SO CENTRAL!!! Close to Metro. About 15 minutes walking distance to The Louve and then to other tourist sights like Notre Dame and Champs Elysee. Also round the corner from the Marais district.\nIn hind sight, a very good find. Very pleased.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:37:15.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
