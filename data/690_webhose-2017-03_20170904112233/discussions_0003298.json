The location is on a quiet street just off Avenue Montaigne which is one of the most exclusive shopping streets (Dior, Chanel, Celine, Saint Laurent, etc). Most of my fashion / couture clients' offices were in immediate walking vicinity and it couldn't have been more convenient.\nI was told the Hotel was designed by Maison Martin Margiela hence the chic black and white and beautiful designs. My room was beautiful and the window overlooked tropical plants. Bathroom looked straight out of a Stanley Kubrick film a la 2001 Space Odyssey. I had never slept in 100% linen sheets before - they were so comfortable and didn't overheat. I will be buying a set for my own home!\nI booked a rate including breakfast and the offering was phenomenal. I entertained clients in the Hotel restaurant one evening as well and it felt like French home cooking in a luxurious setting. Top points!\nI highly recommend the Hotel and will definitely stay again.\nRoom Tip: Loved the luxurious linen bedding!
