The girls toilets were outside and since I went in winter they were a little cold, but clean.\nLike any hostel it can get a bit loud when others come in, but felt very secure and comfortable.\nWould recommend this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:04:35.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
