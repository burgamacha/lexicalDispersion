Wonderful.\nThe hotel location is great for business and pleasure. It is a short walk to the tube, or a longer walk into the financial district. Perfect also for a lovely stroll on the South Bank as far as Parliament. Out of my hotel window was a beautiful view of the Shard.\nLocation really is THAT good. And looking for some fresh sea food or fab street food? Well the Borough Market is very close.\nThe hotel staff were attentive and smiling. The room (for us it was a king bed and Sofa bed) was perfect - clean and modern. WiFi was fine.\nI didnt eat in the restaurant, but had done previously which was good food. This time, with the family... well there is such a choice in London.\nWould I recommend it... well you can see - yes. Best hotel I have stayed in London. And I will be back soon with the family. And I can't wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:34:38.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
