The perfect get-away hotel for a weekend of debauchery for two. Rooms are Parisian small, bu clean and nicely designed. Big fluffy beds and excellent summer rain shower in the bathroom. Restaurant has small but tasty menu, better for snacks to accompany drinks than full meals. Excellent bar hang on the reception floor with good djs and nice atmosphere. I loved my breakfast salad of avocado, mango and ginger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:24:49.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
