You are welcomed by a door man who sets the tone of excellent service. Check-in is swift and then you are personally shown to your room. No tip expected so no awkward fumbling for money at the end of the room tour. A welcome chocolate and macaroon with a hand-written note from the manager shows they are setting the standard in service.\nThe room is not the biggest but really well appointed with lovely linen on the bed. Lots of nibbles to eat and they are all free!\nIf I could add one thing it would be a bath. My room only had a shower but that may have been my choice of room.\nIf you can afford to stay here then stay here !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:15:33.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
