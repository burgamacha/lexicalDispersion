On arriving the welcoming was excellent morning was to much trouble. The rooms are small but are of excellent standards very clean and tidy. The staff at this hotel are five star and are very very helpful. The hotel is decorated to a high standard and is always clean. Location is on a side street but can get a bit busy. My only recommendation is when you book ask for a room to the back of the hotel to avoid the noise of the traffic. If I was going to Paris again I would defend book this hotel big thanks to all the staff you are doing a great job", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:00:08.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
