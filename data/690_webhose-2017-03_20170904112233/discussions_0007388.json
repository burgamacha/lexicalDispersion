This hotel is conveniently located close to Victoria Station and to lots of restaurants and shops so there is plenty of life nearby. The staff are very welcoming. The room I had was spacious with an opening window (which must be commented upon), a large bathroom and two chairs (one for the desk and one for sitting). There was a coffee machine and tea facilities (hidden in the unit under the TV). There was a cool interface by the bed and on the wall by the bathroom by which you could control most of the functionality of the room - from air conditioning to closing curtains and it was lit by blue LEDS - how cool is that (or, is it slightly passe ? I understand that white is the new blue).\nAnyway, a few niggles. The coffee machine refused to work, there was a step from the bathroom into the main room and the air conditioning was poor. Even having the air conditioning on for hours resulted in no discernable decrease in room temperature. In fact, in the end, I turned it off and the room cooled noticeably!\nThose things being said, the bed was very comfortable and I had a very pleasant nights sleep and breakfast was very tasty. I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:55.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
