My girlfriend and I stayed at the NobleDen last weekend and we'll never forget it! The location couldn't be any better. You're literally right in the middle between Little Italy and Chinatown and a couple blocks from SoHo shopping. It's also 1 mile from the Brooklyn Bridge, the 911 Memorial and several walking paths. There are also over a dozen night clubs in a mile radius! The staff was very friendly and informative. We took them up on a walking tour of the neighborhood and loved it! You can tell the management took great attention to detail. Between the room and the facilities we had everything we could've wanted for our stay. I wish I had a few more days to hang out there! We'll be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:53:43.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
