I took a lot other time to choose a hotel and I'm over the moon of decided on this one for myself and my partner.\nLocation is perfect. Piazza da popolo is literally on the doorstep and leads straight to the coliseum and the trevi fountain and Spanish steps as well and numerous other wonders which you don't expect to see. The Vatican was a short taxi ride away in the opposite direction. All the sites are fantastic and became of the omnia passes I purchased was able to get fast track entrance to everything which was great.\nThe hotel itself is all we could have asked for. The room we had was a deluxe which was a great size with excellent bed and bathroom and sofa with TV and mini bar which was really well priced.\nThe breakfast was perfect and plentiful.\nIf I return to Rome I will most definitely return to this hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:28:09.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
