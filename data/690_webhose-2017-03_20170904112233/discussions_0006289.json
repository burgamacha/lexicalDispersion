Limited tea and coffee in room although offered in the lounge area of the hotel on the ground floor from 2 p.m. through to early evening free of charge.\nWe had a standard room which was just about large enough for us which had a suitable and very clean ensuite (shower) and is as you would expect in an older style hotel in a city.\nWe did not have the breakfast in the hotel as we thought the 15 euro per person price tag seemed a bit high. There was a fridge in the room so we stored yoghurts and milk etc.\nThe hotel was very quiet at night (and day) we were on the third floor overlooking the courtyard which would be nice to sit out in (but not February!).\nThe only things that we thought could be improved were the price of the drinks in the minibar (i.e. cheaper) and as the area is bit cosmopolitan either a small bar in the breakfast area in the hotel and even some limited food provided.\nWhen walking around Paris we would suggest not to carry a guidebook. The only day we did we were either pestered and once insulted.\nThe staff on the front desk were very very helpful. We took one of their restaurant recommendations and were not disappointed. The hotel would happily organise a taxi for you however we walked to Gare du Nord (25 minutes).\nThere is a good small supermarket on Rue Lepic, towards the Moulin Rouge (Metro Blanche) which sells a pretty good range of fresh fruit etc. On the opposite side of the road there was a really nice boulangerie.\nOverall would have given a rating of 4.5 (but the system does not allow this) and would have no hesitation in returning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:31:06.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
