We arrived earlier than standard check in time to a lovely warm welcome and our room being ready. The entrance and lobby to the hotel are lovely. The lift is small yet does the job especially if you're staying on the sixth floor as we did! Hallways are a little tired and could do with freshening up and it was a squeeze into our room as cleaning carts and laundry were lining the walkway but what do you expect when you arrive early! Our room was beautifully decorated and had a fab bathroom particularly the shower! Close to Dupleix Metro station and walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. Definitely recommend the hotel good price for a great city location. Thank you for a lovely stay!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:58:30.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
