We wanted a location close to the theatre and restaurants in the heart of the West End and this was certainly that. Just a few doors away from Queen's Theatre where the show was. What we were not expecting was such a fantastic level of customer service we received at the hotel. It was my wife's birthday (a special landmark one) and the hotel staff went out of their way to make her and our stay a very memorable one indeed. A glass of wine, birthday cake, happy birthday spelt out in petals on the bed and balloons, all on the house - really special. Thank you to the hotel staff for making our stay so special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:59:14.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
