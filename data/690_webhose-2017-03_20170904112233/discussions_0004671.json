This month I went for the first time since it became a Taj. This is my new favorite hotel. It may be the awesome Upper East Side meets midtown location - Central Park literally right outside, along with a 24 hour Apple Store. It may be the classics - elevator operators, old school accents. The incredible food everywhere - room service, Perrine. A better shoe shine than I get at home, every night. This is the perfect NYC business hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:06:49.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
