From the moment we checked in, every member of staff was genuinely friendly and attentive. The breakfast staff couldn't do enough for you! Special shout out also to the housekeeping team, who left a beautiful display of roses and candles in our room one evening (I won't ruin the surprise!) This hotel is in a great location, just a few minutes walk from the South Kensington tube station and the various museums. You are right in the heart of London, but because the hotel is set back in a residental street, you really don't feel you're in a big city. Thank you to everyone at Egerton who made our London stay truly spectacular- I would definitely like to make a return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:43:47.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
