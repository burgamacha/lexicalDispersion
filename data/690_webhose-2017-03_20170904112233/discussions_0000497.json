The floor sparkles as you enter the hotel and are greeted by the friendliest staff who are only too happy to help. Recommendations for restaurants, local sightseeing routes, dinner reservations and even looking after our baggage on the last day after checkout so we could sightsee without our luggage. Breakfast is plentiful, scrambled eggs and smoked salmon recommended! Rooms are spotless and beds large and very comfortable. The ensuite is lovely with everything you need from shampoo to cotton buds. Great little Irish bar called O Sullivan's 2 minutes away too if you want to party until the small hours. All in all a great find, would definitely recommend.\nRoom Tip: Balcony views over a typical Parisien Street, watch the world go by....
