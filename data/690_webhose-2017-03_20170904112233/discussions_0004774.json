The major positives are: the location and condition of the property. The hotel is relatively new (around a year or so), and as such, the property appears in excellent condition. My room was on the top floor, but not with an excellent view. The rooms are a nice size, clean and comfortable with a modern flair. The beds were quite comfortable, and I enjoyed the modern feel of the bathroom - though it may not be for all as it has a frosted glass sliding door as the door to the bathroom. This may not be ideal for those traveling with co-workers, etc. I found the hotel staff to be quite friendly and accommodating.\nThe location is great for those planning to visit Times Square and the Theater District with the 46th street location (Little Brazil).\nFor me the only real negative was the cost of parking ($55/day), since I drove up to NYC. However, this is quite normal for parking in Manhattan.\nOverall, a great stay and I would stay at this property again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:17:32.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
