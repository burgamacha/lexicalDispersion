I spent 5 nights in NYC, and winter here is a low travel season, so hotel rates are much lower. But I was pleasantly surprised how clean, comfy (but small) the rooms were for the price. For one person, it was comfy. For 2 people, might be a bit crowded. The bathrooms are small, but the bed is big and there was a big mirror facing the bed (wink! wink! wink!).\nI always decline housekeeping, because I find it unnecessary, but after 3 nights, they basically send a note saying, \"We're coming in, no matter what!\" I get it, they do it for safely reasons.\nThe hotel design is kinda art deco style, and they always have security wandering the halls. There's a diner on the first floor, and sometimes the lobby can be crowded with young travelers sprawled all over the ground until they can make it to the airport.\nMy stay was surprisingly quiet, cozy, and economical, and you can't beat the location!! The front desk staff and housekeeping were friendly. This was a great hotel, and I can't wait to stay here again!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:58:42.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
