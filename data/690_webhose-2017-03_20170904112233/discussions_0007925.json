Coming on the heels of a demanding business trip to London, I extended my stay to enjoy the city and the St. Martins Lane Hotel was the best decision: perfect location, luxurious but fun vibe (very SoHo/Tribeca NYC), access to an awesome gym and excellent service. In fact, the hotel concierge (Biken) went above and beyond by recommending a nearby tapas restaurant for dinner, personally guiding me there and even offering suggestions on the menu. Wow! That's just incredible attention to detail and a level of service on par with the best hotels. I will definitely stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel again and I plan to tell all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay there!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:26:40.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
