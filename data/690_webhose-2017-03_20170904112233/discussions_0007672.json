The room and bathroom excellent. The breakfast buffet was outstanding.\nThe hotel loses one point because when I booked I specifically requested two connecting rooms. one for me and my wife and the other for my kids. I received an e-mail confirmation from the hotel confirming that the rooms will be connecting. When I arrived I was given two rooms but the connecting door between them was locked. I tried to explain to the lady at the reception that I need the door to be open but she did not seem to to understand my request. As I was tired from the long trip I gave up on trying to explain. Me and my wife ended up sleeping in separate rooms so not to leave the kids alone. For this reason the hotel lost one point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:29:04.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
