I was impressed with the décor the quietness of the hotel and it is walking distance with in a lot of really cool hidden treasures. My husband and I needed an escape from life. With four kids and busy jobs sometimes it is hard to find a decent price in the big city. This place was reasonable, offers a free breakfast. My husband and I needed an umbrella and it was nothing for them to accommodate us. We missed our first night and the hotel was able to work with us keeping us in the same room and gave the next night at a discount. I was very pleased and look forward to going back there in a couple of weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:15:04.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
