The location is perfect as it's only a few minutes walk from Victoria Station. Staff were friendly and helpful.\nThe room was amazing and was impressed by the electric curtains.. view out of the window wasn't the best but didn't spend much time in the room apart from sleeping so that didn't matter.\nThe breakfast was delicious too. Would definitely like to visit again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:39:56.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
