We were checked in very professionally and then went to our room. The bathroom was atrocious with a big split in the enamel around the drain (very dangerous when in the shower as easily could have cut your foot) Poorly finished bathroom in general actually especially for the money involved. We then went to the restaurant/bar for a drink prior to heading out and whilst having our drink a mouse ran right across the unit and floor beside us, I said to the waitress and to be honest the response was just a blank stare. Said unit was the same as the breakfast buffet was served from the following morning enough to say I lost my appetite. We departed the hotel and on my return home I sent in a complaint - the response was actually truly shocking - considering I live over 600 miles away they offered us to stay again for only Â£150 a night We won't be taking up that offer.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:57:41.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
