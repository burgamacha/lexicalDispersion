It was ideal. Despite being narrow, enclosed by two much higher-rise buildings and only 16 floors high it was well-decorated, well-managed, well located and all at a vere reasonable good price. The self-service breakfasts were $13 each and certainly suited us - as it met our British needs: fruit, granola/cereal choices, fruit juices and endless coffee. Then there was scrambled egg, crispy bacon and toast. Yes, there were German and French options but this is what we loved and well worth the price. My son & I asked for a twin-bedded room and the creative design was superb (see photo) thus leaving more general space. Lots of storage, a powerful shower and a room safe too. On the first floor was a small swimming pool and sizeable sauna too. The staff were very helpful and we'd certainly recommend it to Tripadviser readers.\nRoom Tip: Twin rooms excellent See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:26.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
