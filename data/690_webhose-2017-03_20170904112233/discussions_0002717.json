They will keep your bags in the office before check in and after check out so you can explore the city. Literally a short block to the R train for trips into Manhattan, with stops at Central Park, 42nd street, Canal, and Cortland. Hotel is basic, industrial feel, comfortable bed, clean, concrete floors. Very cool decor, nice bar, coffee and juice bar in the AM, Mundo restaurant. No other restaurants close which is disappointing. Safe area yet industrial, seems like it could be an up and coming location. Good value for location if you don't want to pay Manhattan hotel prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:27:16.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
