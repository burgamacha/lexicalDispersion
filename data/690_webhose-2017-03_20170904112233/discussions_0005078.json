Perfect for our family of 3. If you've tried to find a hotel for 2 parents & 1 child, you know how difficult it can be in England (unless you want 3 people in one bed or 2 adults in a full size bed.) We had a king bed & a twin bed. The room wasn't large but very adequate. We really don't spend much time in the hotel except to sleep & shower. Beautifully decorated modern feel. The Soho location is perfect. Short walks to Chinatown & Leicester Square & theater district. Situated about 8 minute walk to subway stops. Easy access to Taxis, convenience store, restaurants, theaters. Soho is like a small Times Square area. Not as crowded or circus-like feel. But eclectic. We would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:12:04.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
