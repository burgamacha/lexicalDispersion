This was just a brilliant experience from the time we walked into the reception. The receptionist was just superb and made the difference, her friendliness and pleasant manner was a joy and immediately made me feel we were in a special place. The hotel staff were ALL very helpful polite and treated you with a smile and respect. Very rare these days for some reason. When we going out for Diner and a show , again the Hotel receptionist made sure we knew where which direction to travel. On our return the Bar was very busy and noisy but the residents lounge( two) were peaceful and calming. Service was brilliant breakfast was perfectly cooked, lots of choices and professional served. The room was fantastic, a junior suite and every thing was so tastefully done, balanced and luxurious. Loved the bath, so deep you could swim in it. One of the best hotel made even better by Holly\nRoom Tip: they are all good rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:22:57.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
