We had a one bedroom apartment and a studio. Both were clean and quite spacious for New York. The location is excellent and was the main reason for our return visit. However we were disappointed that no tea, coffee or milk provided as this is standard in Australia in even the humblest motel. Our room was not serviced on one day but fresh towels were provided. Since this had also happened in our stay in Washington 3 days previously we wondered if this was a deliberate cost cutting measure. The bar was closed for renovation and the small breakfast caf√© required a wait for a table on one morning. Whilst we enjoyed our stay I felt it did not have the same ambience as our previous stay in 2015.\nRoom Tip: Front rooms can be noisy but this is New York after all See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:03:40.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
