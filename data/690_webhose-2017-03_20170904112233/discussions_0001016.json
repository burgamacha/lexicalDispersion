The stay was perfect. The room was excellent, clean and tidy. The rooms aren't huge, but they make use of the space really well! The staff were excellent, extremely helpful and went the extra mile. We got back to our room on day 1 and found a nice bottle of prosecco on ice waiting for us! Everything we needed was all included, adapters available upon request which is a rarity.\nThe Spa in the basement is a great touch and can be booked privately for free!! Just ask reception to schedule your hour slot. We did it twice!\nOverall it was great. Location was ideal! When we come back to Paris, we'll book this hotel again!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:21:43.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
