On arrival we were informed that we been upgraded to a suite. The staff in the hotel Anna and Ansely were extremely helpful. This was a theme that continued throughout out stay., with the breakfast ladies being lovely also. Travelling with a child under one is never easy but staying in a hotel like this certainly makes it a more attractive proposition. Location wise it's fantastic. Very near the train station and within walking distance of the bastille. My wife and I have both agreed we cannot wait to return to this hotel. Just a fantastic experience all round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:54:49.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
