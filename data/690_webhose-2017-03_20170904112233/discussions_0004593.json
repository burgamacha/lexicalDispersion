And they were right! Especially friendly stuff (English speakers too!) very clean and cared for, clearly renovated and with a very modern , sleek design in an old and charmful Paris building. The nice traditional French breakfast is severed in a nice sunroom (wintertime, I was there in January) which has a very cute backyard garden. And its location is great.... practically about 3.6km away from a lot of Paris' jewels, Tower Eifle, Luvru, Champ Elise ave, the castle... you could walk there and enjoy the lovely Parisian atmosphere or take the metro min away from the hotel. Lovely time spent at Mistral ! For sure I'll stay there again for my future business travels, as well as hopefully vacations!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:47:09.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
