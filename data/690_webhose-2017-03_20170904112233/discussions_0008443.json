How wrong I was!\nThe hotel is a very easy 150 yard walk from Royal Albert DLR, and even though it was dark it was simple to find.\nVery efficient check in and we were pleased by the cleanliness and quality of the bedroom. Lovely big comfy bed and excellent bathroom.\nWe did go out of the hotel for dinner, but had a drink at the bar when we got back. Excellent friendly table service by Paula who is an absolute diamond.\nA good night's sleep enabled us to get up early and grab some breakfast before setting off to the airport. We decided to just have a bacon roll each and a croissant plus a few cups of coffee, but other choices were there on the buffet.\nWe could have got a DLR to the airport but that would've taken about 20 mins so we hopped in a cab for a 5 minute ride instead. About as easy and convenient as you could wish for.\nGood and simple wifi too. All in all an excellent hotel for the price and location.\nWould definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:40:21.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
