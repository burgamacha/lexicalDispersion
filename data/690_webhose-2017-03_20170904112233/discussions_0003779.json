The main hotel itself is amazing and the architecture is breathtaking. We stayed in the Towers and the rooms are huge by New York standards. The location is perfect for shopping. One block west to 5th. One block east to Park and right on Madison. We travel to New York several times a year and have stayed at a lot of different hotels, but after this stay The Lotte will be our preferred hotel!\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:23:22.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
