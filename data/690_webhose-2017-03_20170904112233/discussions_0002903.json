We stayed for 4 days in early March and the rooms were fairly compact, but very well appointed and comfortable. The room had a fantastic bathroom with a wonderful shower that would normally be accompanied by a more expensive nightly hotel rate. Additionally, the staff were very warm and friendly offering helpful advice and restaurant reservation assistance. I even ended up injuring my ankle on my first day in Paris and the front desk attendant went over and above by running down ice in the kitchen to treat my injury. Lastly, the breakfast buffet was extremely well appointed and the food was delicious. A great start to any morning. I can't wait to return on my next visit to Paris! Thank you for a wonderful experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:02:13.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
