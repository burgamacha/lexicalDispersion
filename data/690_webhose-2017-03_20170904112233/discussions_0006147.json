The hotel receptionist was able to give us a room even though we arrived early. The doormen and the housekeeping staff are always courteous and friendly. The water pressure in the shower was good. The room was clean and tidy and well lit. There is a supermarket diagonally across from the hotel. Restaurants are everywhere and the subway is just outside of the hotel. Super convenient and easy walk to most major sites we wanted to visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:11:26.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
