The hotel has a GREAT location in the wonderful Marais neighborhood (3rd arr.), a stones through from Oberkampf and Republique. You're surrounded by amazing restaurants in a very cute, walkable neighborhood. The hotel itself is adorable and at the staff really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They are always available to answer questions, provide a recommendation, or open a bottle of wine you might bring back to enjoy in your room. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. It was incredibly quiet at night. Loved staying here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:31:56.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
