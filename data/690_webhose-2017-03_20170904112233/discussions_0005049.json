Perfect location. Turn left and it takes you on 5 th avenue or turn right and that takes you to Broadway. The hotel is on a lovely quiet street.\nRooms- we had a room on the 18th floor with a view. Just breath taking! Beds are lovely and comfortable with turn down service.\nSky lounge- very fashionable and always busy. Worth a spend up there.\nThe concierge had booked us the hop on and off bus but I think it was cheaper if you had gone to the sellers on the street in front of the empire building.\nAcross the street I would recommend breakfast in Cafe Bonjour and the Cuban restaurant Havana Ny is also very good.\nWeekends get extremely busy at thus hotel and the sky bar was booked for a private party. We experienced a lot if noise from a room next door which were having some sort of party. When I phoned reception they handled it very swiftly and sent security to their room to remind them of the 2 person occupancy and to keep the noise down. I never heard anything after that. The manager even called to appologise for any inconvenience caused and offered us a complimentary breakfast which we couldn't accept. Fantastic service and we all couldn't have picked a better hotel for my son's 21 st birthday.\nRoom Tip: Higher floors with empire view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:33:21.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
