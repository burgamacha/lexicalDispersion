Surprised my girlfriend and they did everything to make it perfect. Petals on the bed etc.\nRoom was a Balneo Paris Paradis. Once again just perfect. Loved the jacuzzi bath and the fact that it was in the room. Overlooked the city with a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. Bed in the middle of room was interesting and very nice and the breakfast in bed while looking out the lovely windows was beautiful.\nAll amenities you could want. Brilliant service. Gino was especially engaging and even offered us a drink while we waited for our taxi.\nAll in all a very special weekend break.\nStay here. You won't regret it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:02:19.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
