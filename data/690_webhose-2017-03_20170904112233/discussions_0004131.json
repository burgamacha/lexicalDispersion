Stayed in a room for about $110 in March 2017. Great view of the Empire State Building right out my window. Subway station is about 30 steps from the front door. Walk to Times Square no problem.\nFront desk checked me into the room in under 60 seconds. Checkout was probably 30 seconds more. Nice security guard watched my bags on the day of my departure.\nRooms are typical New York small. But bed was comfortable. TV was nice. Refrigerator and microwave also in the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:30:48.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
