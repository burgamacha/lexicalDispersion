On arrival we were told we had been upgraded and the new room was in the annexe, a building along the road. At first I was dubious about this, previous experience has shown that annexes make you feel less part of the hotel and are not superior accommodation. However, this wasn't the case at all. The room was spacious, spotless and quiet. Staff were incredibly attentive (an iron/ironing board were delivered in minutes) and the building felt safe. Free mini bar was a nice touch, bed huge and most comfortable. Breakfast in the main building was great and usual hot/cold selection.\nLocation is ideal. We walked everywhere for the main sights and there's some lovely restaurants/bars just a few streets away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:36:12.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
