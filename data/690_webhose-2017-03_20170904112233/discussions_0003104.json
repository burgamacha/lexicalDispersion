However, it was very smartly designed with a microwave, fridge, kitchen sink, and nespresso machine area tucked away as we walked in. Every amenity you could need was smartly designed into the small space. The room was comfortable and modern in design, like the rest of the hotel. I appreciated that all lights could be turned off from a panel next to the bed. The shower was spacious and there was a decent amount of room for toiletries to sit above the sink area in the bathroom. My partner's only compliant was that the shades did not completely block the light. The location itself is excellent, right next to Buckingham Palace. We left around noon one day and caught the changing of the guard madness. If you are flying in from Gatwick airport the train goes directly to Victoria station which is an easy 5 minute walk away from the hotel. We used this method to get to and from the airport and it was inexpensive and easy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:04:11.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
