The staff are very efficient, friendly, and give me a lot of help during the stay. I love the lighting as it is very bright. There are two USB ports and a socket on each side of bed, very convenient. However, there is only one wardrobe without drawers, which are not enough for family staying for a few days. I suggest to add drawers and hooks for the room. The breakfast is typical Novotel style.\nRemember to avoid breakfast peak hours of family stay as there are a lot of kids and you have to queue for table, and food etc, and this will disrupt your plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:37:22.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
