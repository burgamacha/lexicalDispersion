We were there for 9 nights in early February. Staying in the Residence Club is highly recommended. The staff there was SO hospitable, making us feel at home. Plus they have a great breakfast which is included with your room.\nI travel a ton and stay in a lot of nice hotels. This has been one of the best experiences I have had in a while. Enough for me to write this review.\nA special thanks again to all of the incredible hosts in the Residence Club. Sally, Vera, Cornelia, Steven, Betty, Chris, Leona and Hannah... You made our stay!\nRoom Tip: Residence Club is worth the extra money... for sure See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:26:38.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
