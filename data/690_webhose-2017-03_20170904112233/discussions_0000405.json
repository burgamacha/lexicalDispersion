We were seated at the bar very quickly by a fabulous host Fabio. At the bar counter here is a rare gem as you have a ringside seat for the cocktail making action.\nThe cocktails were outstanding, helped by some lovely bar snacks, we were not long seated when Fabio offered us a nice table, we kindly declined as we were now engrossed in the action in and around the bar. Turns out our host was also the bar manager and he is a credit to your 5 star hospitality and charm.\nAfter a few drinks we checked out the second bar in the hotel The Connaught bar, Stuart quickly seated us, he recomended some cocktails that he and his team recently designed for The festive season and we were not dissapointed. the attention to detail here is something special. The service was a great mix of fast efficient and of course uber cool headed up by the professional hospitality of Stuart & cocktail maestro Agostino.\nThank you team Connaught Hotel we will certainly return and tell everybody to do the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:19:03.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
