It was my first visit there and I was extremely tired. As I entered into the building I was immediately greeted, by A well professionally dressed young lady, by the name of Natasha. She made me feel very welcome after a long tiring trip from across the country. She made sure that I was properly welcomed and informed about the features of the hotel. She gave excellent customer service in which I am grateful. I say to the management, Promote her as soon as possible.
