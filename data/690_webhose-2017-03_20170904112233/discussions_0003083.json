Kimberley checked us in and was very warm and friendly. The rest of the staff were also really nice, especially Rocky. We had Room 2404 which had a great view of the Empire State Building and location was a slow 10 minute walk to Times Square.\nI had read alot of reviews about elevator waiting times but we never had to wait more than 5mins no matter what time of the day or night it was. My 2 grown up kids discovered the vending machine in the basement so the elevators were used an awful lot -- as were the onsite resturant and bar.\nAs expected, for Manhattan, the room was small but extremely clean. It also had the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The shower was really big with unlimited hot water and a massive big pile of towels which were changed frequently. There was also a safe in the wardrobe and 4 usb ports.\nI thoroughly recommend The Holiday Inn at Times Sq\nRoom Tip: Better view from rooms that are on a higher front facing floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:49:15.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
