It was around the corner from the bus station which will take you directly to Earls Court Underground station. Don't go here from West Kensington station. The rooms were a little on the small size when the couch is pulled out, but it's not America, so don't expect the same things. When the bed was back in the couch, it was more than enough room for us 4. We went to the breakfast once. It was o.k. There is a McDonalds down the street about 6 blocks and a lot of other food places around. The price was right and the staff was very helpful. We would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:45:26.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
