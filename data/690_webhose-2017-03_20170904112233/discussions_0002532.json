Got back at 2 and asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Junior Suite for a very minimal price and let me say if it's available DO IT - the room as HUGE - well tremendous by NYC standards - and extremely clean. The staff took the time to ask about what we were in NYC for and the next day checking out remembered (even though the hotel was fully booked) to ask how our concert was and who we were seeing.\nI would definitely return again and highly suggest this boutique hotel- you won't be disappointed", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:58:26.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
