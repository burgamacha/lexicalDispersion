Although breakfast room is nicely arranged, food offering is lacking, definitely if you are vegetarian or even worse if you are vegan. If food was being placed in a chafing dish to keep it warm & a little bit more seasoning will be a small effort towards huge improvement. A little bit more fresh vegetables rather than more meat would be great. Lastly- having a loud TV broadcasting news is definitely the last thing most guests would like to have on their holiday breakfast.\nOtherwise the hotel is in good location, with nice periodical features. While room size is small (and we got the deluxe room!) it's ok because why stay in a room when in Rome? All in all it was nicely equipped and bed was amazingly comfortable. Staff are friendly and welcoming and if they up their breakfast game it will be perfect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:35:02.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
