The location is central to all the main attractions. The rooms are small, but perfectly formed with modern decor and a high level of cleanliness. We enjoyed a wonderful stay and could not fault a thing.\nThey provide some lovely touches that are not always standard in hotels such as free wifi in all rooms, complementary tea and cakes mid-afternoon, free safety deposit box and fresh bottled water. We would definitely return - thank you for a great stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:11:45.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
