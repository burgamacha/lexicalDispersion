The staff is so polite and go out of their way to help you with anything, inside or outside the hotel. The restaurant has wonderful food. The rooms are very cozy. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Rooms are very clean. Shower water pressure perfect. We had to stay an extra day due to weather and they helped us right out. We even were able to stay in the same room.
