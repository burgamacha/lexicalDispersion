Our rooms were cleaned every day which was nice but didn't always leave enough towels. when we checked in, there wasn't a room ready for us and we had to wait 30 minutes which wasn't great as we had been travelling for 18 hours and we just wanted to go to bed and the woman on reception dissapered for 10 mins without telling us what was going on so we had to ask the gentleman that was working there to find out where she was and what was happening.no apology from her for having to wait. overall we liked the hotel and would stay again if we had the same room", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:06:47.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
