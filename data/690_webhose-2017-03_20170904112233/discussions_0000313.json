As we live in San Francisco it was a short ride from home but a lovely getaway. We enjoyed buffet breakfast on Sunday and treated ourselves to room service for dinner on Saturday night. The room was quiet and we had a lovely view of the San Francisco Bay. The bed truly was heavenly and the use of a spa robe was an added luxury. The pool and spa area were lovely. Eve Sheffield in Guest Services did an exceptional job in and made us feel special. I would highly recommend this hotel for travelers or for those looking for a little vacation closer to home\nRoom Tip: Request a room overlooking the San Francisco Bay See more room tips Green Features: The Westin SFO is an excellent, environmentally friendly hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:36:17.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
