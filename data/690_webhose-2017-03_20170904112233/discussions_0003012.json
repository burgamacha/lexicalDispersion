You can even enjoy the view from the bathtub while taking a nice warm bath after a long day. It's not easy to find a hotel with modern decor and amenities near Wangfujing Street. Most of them look dated or traditional. But this hotel is an exception at a reasonable price. Also Loved the fact that it was on a quieter part of the street. The location is great, close to a few malls and nice restaurants. Not everyone at the reception spoke English which was a little difficult but they definitely tried to help. We asked for a late check-out and the staff gladly accommodated our request.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:23:01.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
