So most people use Uber, but I found that the subway was okay: a bit of an extra walk that wasn't a problem, but might have been if the weather was terrible or I was traveling alone.\nHowever, Long Island City is a lot of fun, with terrific ethnic food, and hipster options, that are much more affordable than Manhattan. And the hotel itself is newly created, with an interesting, attractive design, comfortable shared spaces and unusually roomy rooms for New York City. We found a few little hiccups in service, but nothing very important, and the bed was excellent, the TV was huge and well placed, the room was sunny and we could open the windows and the street was quite quiet.\nWe had gotten a good online deal, so the room was an especially good value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:55:07.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
