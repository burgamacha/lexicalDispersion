This is a small boutique hotel and the service provided by Patrycja, Andrew, Dominic, Maria and Adele was tremendous. We were pampered from the moment we arrived. We had a small problem with the toilet and for the inconvenience, we were offered breakfast for the week for my wife and I. They arranged great seats for both The Book of Mormon and Wicked on the day of the shows. Every restaurant suggestion was custom tailored to our needs. They sent us a bottle of Vuevre Champagne to our room, just because. After I stopped to thank them for the outstanding week in London, they arranged a transport to the airport free of charge in a Mercedes S-class sedan. I can't say enough about the staff and the service at 41. The reviews are true and I can't wait to stay in one of their properties again. Thank you again to Andrew, Dominic, Adele, Maria, Patrycja! You made our trip second to none", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:56:07.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
