Generally rooms are small and Timhotel's rooms (at least room 515) is actually a little bit larger than many other Parisian hotelrooms. The room was very clean and nice. Bathroom very small (no surprise ...) but functional. Hair dryer included. One of the two lights in the mirror was out of order and need to be changed though.\nHot water kettle, tea and coffee facilities in room. Breakfast buffet has something for everybody - even pancakes, and is served in a nice room or in the small backyard garden.\nI suspect that, at least the room we had, will be very hot during summer (there's a fan in the room) as the sun shines on the windows from morning to sunset. We were there i March, so we didn't have a problem with that at all. All Timhotel rooms are not in the main buildning and I have no idea about the standard in the other rooms, but maybe, just maybe ... it's an explanation to why people's reviews of the hotel is quite varying?\nLocation is superduper. All kinds of stores, restaurants, bars in vincinity. The 3 metrostations - all nearby, give access to all of Paris.\nWe can definitely book this hotel in future as we have nothing to complain about and our stay was really enjoyable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:54:49.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
