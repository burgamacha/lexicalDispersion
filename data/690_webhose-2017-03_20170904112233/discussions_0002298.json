When we first checked in the staff member, which i think may have been the manager at the time, was extremely rude which put us off at the start however all other staff members were quite friendly. Elevator was annouying but we took the start which was not too bad. Rooms are really nice and modern - very clean. Overall i would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:12:00.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
