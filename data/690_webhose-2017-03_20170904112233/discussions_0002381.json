It is just a few steps away from the hustle and bustle of the heart of Times Square--close enough to be part of it, but far enough to get away from the craziness.\nMy room was located on the 22nd floor of the room. It was on the backside of the hotel, and overlooked the shorter building on 41st Street behind it. I even had a view of the spire on the Empire State Room. The room was typical small for New York, featuring just one queen size bed, with two nightstands, and a unit that included a writing desk and closet. The room also had a a Keurig coffee maker, fridge and microwave. The bed was a bit firmer that most hotels, but still comfortable. There were several pillows in different sizes and firmness.\nThe bathroom was nice. There was a large vanity area and a couple of shelves. There was a large shower stall as well--no tub.\nThe room was pretty quiet for the most part. I could just barely hear sounds from the street below (one of the nights I was there, there were lots of horns beeping at 1:00 a.m.--it wasn't enough to keep me awake, but I could hear them very softly). My only complaint is that the doors to the rooms slam loudly--normally, I don't thing this would be a problem, but there were some presumably drunk college age kids who were knocking on each others doors and slamming them at 1:00 a.m. and talking loudly at their doors (which is how I noticed the horns as well).\nThe hotel lobby is located on the 4th floor of the building. Check in was quick and easy, and they gave me two bottles of water when I checked in. You had to scan your key in the elevator to select a guest room floor.\nOverall I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, and I will definitely stay here again (if the price is right).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:29:58.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
