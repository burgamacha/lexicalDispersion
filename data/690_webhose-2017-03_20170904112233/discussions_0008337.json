The hotel itself was clean and was quiet in the evenings. We had a few drinks in the evening at the bar which was reasonably priced for London and the bar staff were very friendly. The next morning, we decided we would like to have continental breakfast and when we went to pay the chap said that he would only charge us for 5 and as it was Mother's Day we could all upgrade to full cooked breakfast free of charge (if we had a photo with the staff for the newsletter). The breakfast selection itself was good and replenished quickly.\nWould recommend for cheap and cheerful accommodation near to the theatre, Westfield Shopping Centre and the Olympic Park", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:24:49.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
