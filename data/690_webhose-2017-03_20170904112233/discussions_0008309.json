The lobby and common spaces are unexpectedly magnificent, like an old mansion. Our rooms were large and very comfortable, although the bathroom in one of the penthouse suites was weirdly situated at the entrance to the room, and that room has no balcony, so try to avoid it (sorry, I don't remember the room number). The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were large and well-appointed. Breakfast at the adjacent restaurant was very good. Staff were friendly and helpful. We would certainly stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:19:02.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
