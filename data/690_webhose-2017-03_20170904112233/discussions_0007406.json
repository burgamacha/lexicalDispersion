This is a different hotel, is a different hotel experience, it’s an awesome experience. We felt being a part of a Woody Allen movie (one of the good ones) and enjoyed it so much.\nGreat location in the middle of this buzzy city, you can literally walk to everything. At the same time, quiet and peaceful.\nThe room we stayed in, standard room was beautiful, fantastic bathroom, most amazing wooden floor and so much more. Free minibar, how cleaver… we like.\nIf you are looking for a 5 – star modern + hotel with buzzy bars and loud music in the reception – this is not the place. Though, if you are looking for some light jazz, an historical experience, excellent breakfast and just something else we can thoroughly recommend it. Don’t forget the rooftop and some prosecco\nThank you Marco and Franco for great service, restaurant tips, tickets, conversations. You guys are awesome.\nCath / Lenn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:25:54.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
