The location is excellent, and the hotel was incredible. From the minute we arrived, we loved everything about it. The door staff always greets you and helps with whatever you need. The check-in staff showed us around the hotel and gave us a tour of our room. The concierge staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and we used their services frequently.\nThe hotel is beautiful, and our room was great. Heated floors in the bathroom, a great shower, separate bathtub, TV in the bathroom mirror, etc. The bedroom is spacious and has nice amenities. Controls for all lights and drapes right next to the bed, a desk with a fully functioning iPad for your use, TV on a swivel mount, and much more. The hotel staff pressed my suit and shirt the morning of the wedding for free. They also drove us a few blocks away for the wedding in the house car. The restaurant/bar area was very nice with a good view of 57th. The workout/spa facilities on the 25th floor was excellent as well. Large indoor pool area with views of the city. Very nice locker room area, and an upstairs gym with views of the city and Central Park.\nI have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone!\nRoom Tip: We stayed on the 11th floor and didn't have much of a view, but never had any issues with noise...
