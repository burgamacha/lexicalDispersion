The hotel is a lovely place to stay. The service is spectacular. I noticed that there was no full length mirror in the room and the staff delivered a standing mirror to the room. Anything we requested was delivered within minutes.\nWe stayed in a huge suite (part of their Black Friday deal) which had 2 walk-in closets to accommodate all of our purchases.\nI highly recommend this hotel!\nRoom Tip: If you can get a good deal, go for a suite!
