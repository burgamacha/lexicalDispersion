The welcome was genuine and warm, and it continued with the rest of the staff we came into contact with during our three-day stay.\nThe furnishings and rooms were clean and comfortable, and my wife was impressed by the large closets and drawer space not often found in Europe. House-keeping crept away when they saw our request to sleep longer after our horrible in-bound journey, and extra towels were promptly delivered and refreshed during the whole stay. Overall, the room was well-appointed and everything worked as expected â€” when I needed to charge a third U.S. device, the front desk lent me a convertor.\nThe Concierge's Desk had all the maps and advice we needed, and we were delighted to find how many Metro stations were within easy walking distance, from where we could jump on a variety of lines to reach all of central Paris. Buying a carnet (ten tickets at a time), we quickly rode the Metro from sight to sight, including the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre and the Arc de Triomphe. And when we needed a taxi, the hotel's efficient doormen had one in an instant.\nVisiting in January at the height of the Parisian sales, we also found the Marriott Opera within walking distance of the legendary Galleries Lafayette department store, which serves as a focal point for a whole number of other upscale retailers, successfully challenging the over-priced and fussy stores on the Champs Elysees.\nWe did not eat at the hotel, but we enjoyed the extensive buffet breakfast and friendly service in the Executive Lounge, which was available to us. We also visited the ground floor bar area, which was also welcoming.\nWithin very easy walking distance are a host of restaurants and bars, and we always felt safe and secure in the neighborhood. With that in mind, the hotel employed discrete but attentive security guards and that, and for all the other reasons, means we will stay there again when next in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:41:44.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
