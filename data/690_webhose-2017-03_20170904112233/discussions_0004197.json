The staff were fantastic, always wanting to help even when the lobby was busy. Brian was particularly great in doing everything he could to make our day special. Our room was great with the bed being the highlight ensuring a perfect nights sleep after long days seeing many sights in a truely beautiful city. Would highly recommend for all occasions as the viceroy was perfecly located for all of our needs.
