It's a bit cramped for 3 people - but we managed.\nIt's perfectly located. There's a subway station few meters away from the hotel. Touristy areas are relatively near (probably around 10 blocks to Time Square) - but still far enough to have a relatively quiet neighborhood.\nFree breakfast (with unlimited coffee refills) is claimed in the restaurant at the ground level - this means tip is expected. Food is OK, but I could easily get a better value breakfast around the area.\nCourteous hotel staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:23:16.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
