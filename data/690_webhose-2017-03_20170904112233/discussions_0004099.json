We loved it. Most important to me when staying overnight is the cleanliness of the hotel, and this hotel was clean, the staff were courteous, professional, helpful and attentive. The kitchen in the room was so convenient, for making your own meal (when not trying one of the many restaurants in NY) The neighborhood was very convenient to some great little restaurants and for getting anywhere in NY as the subway is just a few blocks away .. or walk, and as we found out the staff or stranger on the street will help you find your way if you get lost. The bed was very comfortable, the room quiet. I would 100% recommend this hotel, and hope to make another trip to visit NY and will stay at the Dumont NYC Affinia hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:25:02.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
