Very close to the Tube and Tower Bridge. Plenty of restaurants in the area and short walk to St Katherine's Dock for eating and drinking which isn't touristy due to being hidden away and I think a it's a little gem.\nAmazing bar next door at the Hilton Double Trees sky bar.\nBreakfast was everything and more than you expect.\nWill return for sure. I have children with me and it felt safe and easy to get around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:52:42.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
