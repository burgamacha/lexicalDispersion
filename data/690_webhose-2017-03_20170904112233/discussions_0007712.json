This is a small boutique hotel with very personal service. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It is a short walk to Hyde Park and nearby moderately priced restaurants. It is 3 blocks walk to Paddington Station.\nThe continental breakfast was included with our room. It included cold cereals, yogurt, 3 diffferent fruit salads, pastries and juices. You can order other breakfast options, including a full English breakfast for an additional cost.\nThe room was very nice with a king bed, spacious bath with shower and tub.\nWe look forward to our next visit.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 5th floor and it was very quiet.
