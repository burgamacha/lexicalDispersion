They worked with us on early checking, making reservations, and directions anytime we needed.\nLocation: It is walking distance to the Louvre, Cathedral, and the Spa is great.\nThis was my first time going to Paris and I spent a lot of time researching hotels and where to stay. I finally stumbled upon this beautiful gem when searching for the best hotels in a great location. We fell in love wit the ambiance in the pictures and they didn't disappoint. Hotel: The hotel is a cute little boutique in a great neighborhood. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by an amazing sensual aroma that immediately made us feel welcome . The hotel lobby is a cute and has a fireplace in the seating area. The hotel itself is in great location, walking distance to the Louvre and Notre Dame. We enjoyed being able to stroll around the area to grab breakfast and lunch while we explored the sites. Room: The room was beautifully decorated, clean and the bed was referred to as the \"cloud\" the entire trip. It was so soft and was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have been in. The rain shower came out steaming hot in an instant and it was welcomed nicely after a cold walk in the Paris winter. As mentioned the rooms are a bit on the small side, but that is a given in historical Paris.. But getting ready to get out was a bit cramped. But it is more than worth it for the ambiance , location, and for the fact you should be out exploring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:22:10.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
