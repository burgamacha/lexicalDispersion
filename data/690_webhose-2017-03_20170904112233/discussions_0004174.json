Great diner right on the corner, too many restaurants to name just a short walk away, different prices so you can choose whatever fits your budget. The service was wonderful, very knowledgeable, pleasant people who gave us anything we requested. The room was big in a small hotel, filled with old world charm but modern amenities, all for a great price! Will stay again.\nRoom Tip: The third floor is nice because the sauna is on it.
