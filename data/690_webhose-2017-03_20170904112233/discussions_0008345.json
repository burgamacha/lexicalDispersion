I was immediately greeted when I arrived and check-in was quick and easy. This was the only time I met a member of the PI staff during my stay and she was polite and efficient. The double bed was very comfortable, the room was clean. The view was not great, but then it didn't bother me as I arrived in the dark and left early next day! Some road noise of course as it is in the city. A reasonable price for a night's stay in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:56:42.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
