Booked a mini-suite for a family of four, and last minute I added on a separate basic room for the kids. They managed to put us close together on the same floor. The suite was HUGE. The room was GREAT by Rome standards. Comfortable linens, large bathrooms with great amenities... Both rooms had minibars that were stocked daily (although more choices in the suite understandably) which was a welcome treat. Staff go out of their way to please you and fulfill any request - from housekeeping to front desk to bellhops to waiters. Breakfast also a huge plus - simple but great choices and they vary different table offerings daily. The best part is the location - you literally can walk anywhere from here. Walking back is uphill, though, so be warned, but its proximity made cab rides even cheap. Rooftop restaurant also great for a prosecco break in the middle of the day or for dinner at night. Look no further for a hotel in Rome!\nRoom Tip: Mini-suites are very spacious for two but can fit four people if need be.
