This time I was coming with my kids for their first visit, so I wanted to be in the heart of it all. It's hard to imagine a hotel with a better combination of location, value and friendly, personalized, old-fashioned service.\nLocation: the hotel is right off of the Rue de Rivoli, across from the Tuilleries gardens. So many of the major attractions of Paris are literally steps away: Louvre, Opera, Place Vendome, Musse d'Orsay, Madeleine. For those that are a bit father away, the number 1 metro line is just steps away. It's important to note the hotel is not ON the Rue de Rivoli, so you get all the advantages of proximity without the disadvantages of noise & bustle.\nValue: It's a small hotel, it's central Paris so the rooms are not huge. If you need a big room to roam in, this is not your hotel. But they are perfectly comfortable, becautifully appointed and decorated and the bathrooms are big and perfect. Dollar for dollar its hard to imagine a better value in this location.\nFriendly and attentive service: I felt incredibly welcomed not only when I walked in the door, but before I did. I wanted tickets to a horse show. They emailed me the link to buy the tickets and when I couldn't get it done the manager tried to buy the tickets with his own credit card. Didn't work out but not his fault. On top of that, I had made a mistake and booked us a day early. They called when I didn't show to make sure I was coming. I was very apologetic and prepared to pay for the room. It should be noted that under certain circumstances, if they had been fully-booked, they would have asked me to do so. But they weren't fully-booked so they didn't charge us. I was flabbergasted. That's personalized service: they will help you out when it's reasonable and fair.\nIf you are coming to Paris for the first time and want to be in the center of it all, I can't imagine a better choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:38:23.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
