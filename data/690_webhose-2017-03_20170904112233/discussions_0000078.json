Great location of this hotel meant we were within walking distance of most sites. If not the metro is so close and easy to use. The room was comfortable with an enormous bed, just what we needed after a lovely but tiring day. Breakfast was delicious, a wonderful selection of tasty good quality foods, juices and fruit all within sight of the colosseum from the roof terrace. A lovely touch in the evening was the turn down service which left a clean towel and a pair of slippers for my tired feet when we returned to the room. Thank you Capo d,Africa staff, you are all wonderful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:52:57.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
