I am a newly minted Hilton diamond member so I decided to try the HIlton property, I booked a suite and I was very impressed to find upon check in that I had been upgraded to an even bigger suite than what I had booked! It was a beautiful room with a dining room and kitchen which was very convenient for my dietary needs. The hotel was in a very good location near the center of the city and right next to a couple shopping malls. The concierge was especially helpful in arranging our tours and the bellmen were very friendly and helpful as well. The only reason I debated giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is that the check in staff seemed a bit undertrained and there was definitely a language barrier with the front desk staff in general. There was also no diamond check in/check out line provided, however the beautiful suite and the positive staff experience with the concierge and bellmen won me over to a 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:08:27.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
