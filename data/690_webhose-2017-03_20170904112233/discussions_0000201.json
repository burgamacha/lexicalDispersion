The location is about a 20 minute walk from several major attractions and a 15 minute metro ride from the Vatican. The metro station is a five minute walk from the hotel. We desired a quiet room and we could not hear any noise from the street. The breakfast buffet was high quality with a large selection and excellent coffee. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Our delux room was clean, modern, with a large bathroom. Upon return to Rome we would definitely return to Hotel Artemide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:25:26.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
