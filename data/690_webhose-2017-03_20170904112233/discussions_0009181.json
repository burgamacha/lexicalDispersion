For the first 6 nights, we were accommodated in a Deluxe Room in the basement which was a bit too tight for 4 people, but all in all, it was still a cozy place for stay (good mattress by the way!). For the 3-night stay later, we were accommodated to another Deluxe Room in the third floor which was more spacious with an open view. How we wish we had this room from the beginning!\nThe hotel is located in a very easy location and it is only about 7/8-minute walk away from Earl's Court Station, which connects the Piccadilly, District and Circle lines, which essentially take you to everywhere in Central London or the main train stations. There are a lot of good restaurants along Earl's Court Road, as well as a Saintbury's along Cromwell Road.\nI must say our stay was made even better by the exceptional service brought by the receptionists in the hotel, in particular Alex who was very helpful and offered very good advice on dining and sightseeing.\nAll in all, it is a very good hotel and we will very possibly come back to the Nadler Kensington next time we travel to London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:09:55.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
