Comfortable and clean room with a really nice street view. Close walk to two Metro stops: Raspail (Green+Magenta Lines) and Vavin (Magenta Line). Tons of dining nearby. Luxemborg Gardens a short walk. It was a little loud at night, but I don't know if there's much avoiding those Paris sirens if you stay on a busy street. We enjoyed the Montparnasse area. We did not spend much time in our room, so this small but clean hotel was perfect.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:34:23.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
