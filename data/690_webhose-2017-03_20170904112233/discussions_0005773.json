The staff was AMAZING and the real star of the show. We were there for general tourism, and the location seemed central enough, nothing seemed particularly far away and there was plenty to eat nearby.\nThe room was like a micro hotel room... the beds were small, the furniture was small, etc, but you almost don't even notice at first because of the care they seemed to put in it's design. Over all, and considering it was New York a city notorious for it's premium on space, it was a well appointed and comfortable room.\nI chose this place in no small part for it's breakfast as I had a 3 year old in tow and I thought it would make starting the day out easier, but, unfortunately the breakfast did not include much of anything my picky eater would eat. If I had to add one recommendation for the hotel management it would be to add a waffle bar! They please pretty much everybody and are pretty easy to setup (I do them for brunches all the time for just those reasons.)\nOver all, it was a pretty nice place, but I would likely pick a different place next time if only because my child (nor my picky husband) really took advantage of the breakfast setup. Nice place, though!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:00:20.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
