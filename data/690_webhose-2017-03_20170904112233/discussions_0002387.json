Our room wasn't big size, but enough, there was two twin bads and a great view to the city. The hotel's location is good, close to subway station, to Macy's, to Madison Square Garden and 15 min walking to Times Square. The breakfast was good, with fruits, yorgut, breads, juices, eggs. I will stay at this hotel again when i come back to NYC.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a high floor and city view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:52:51.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
