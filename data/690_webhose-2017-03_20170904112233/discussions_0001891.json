Super friendly service at check in. We had a king bed, they offered a free upgrade to a double bed room that had a view of the Empire State building. We looked, but quickly switched back to the king bed room. No hassle. Rooms are very small, but engineered to perfection. Very clean. Modern d√©cor. Loved the bathroom. Roof top bar, Spy Glass - very nice with view of the Empire State building. I would say great for a night or two in the city. Not sure I would want to do a vacation week here. For that, I'd need a bit more space. Otherwise, this is a good value for the price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:14:41.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
