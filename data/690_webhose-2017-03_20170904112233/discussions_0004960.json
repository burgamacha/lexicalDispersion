The rooms are small, but that's NYC for you! They were very clean and modern. Views from the room were great. The staff was very gracious and helpful. My friends and I especially loved the location. It's within a 10-15 minute walk to Central Park, Times Square, theaters, loads of restaurants, and Rockefeller Center, as well as just a block over from a subway station. We remarked on several occasions how great our location was. Would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:14:56.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
