It might be a little far east for some, but it was perfect for us. I liked that it was quiet at night. Coffee shop next door (Demarco's) and a Duane Reade up the street one block. The hotel staff were very welcoming, especially the concierge who went out of her way to get us tickets to the new Whitney museum. The rooms are large for NYC standards, too! And you're also able to crack the windows - something that comes in handy even in winter. This is an old building and they tend to get a little stuffy. The room came with a kitchenette with a coffee machine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:35:38.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
