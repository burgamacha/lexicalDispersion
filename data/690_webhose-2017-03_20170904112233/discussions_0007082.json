I got off late and had to work a double the next day.\nThe guy that checked me in, the loyalty champion was extremely nice and I received a very warm welcome. I let him know that I was here only a few hours to sleep and preferred a room on a low floor. (the elevators can be quite a wait) he was able to move some things around to get me on a low floor. (the woman next to him on the other hand had a typical New York attitude).\nThe hotel is in walking distance to Times Square and there are many places to eat around the area. (Personally I would steer clear of 9th Ave after 11PM near Port Authority).\nThe room was very quaint and the bed was extremely cozy. Shower is amazing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:50:37.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
