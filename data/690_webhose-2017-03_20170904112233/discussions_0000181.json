The bad is very comfortable, the sower as well. It seems someone really thought on each signal item, and it works.\n2- The service is superb. All hotel workers are highly helpful, smiles all the time.\n3- breakfast- This is something special. (See in my pictures) first time I see full service in hotel breakfast. It is not a huge selection, yet again, everything is in high quality with a lot of thinking.\nIf you are looking for small and friendly hotel in the heart of Paris, this is your place without a doubt.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:36:33.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
