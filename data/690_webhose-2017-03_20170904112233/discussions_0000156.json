Staff were very nice from arrival to departure. Room was nice, walls were covered in fabric which made the room warm we slept with window open but this was January and I feel it might be to much in the hotter months!! Breakfast was nice good selection of cold meats and fresh fruit. Fresh breads and pastries. Above all the location was great little shop next door, 10 min walk to main station in roam for airports but other stations even closer, loads of restaurants nearby. Id ever I'm lucky enough to return to roam will return to this hotel!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:23:58.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
