In the lobby you'll find a bar, some Apple Mac's(free to use) and a touch screen games table for children.\nThe room had only been refurbished a month ago so was in fab condition. Lovely shower, bed and coffee maker. The only downside is the sink is next to the bed and we didn't like the mirrored toilet door!\nWe specifically looked for a hotel with a car park there were plenty of spaces and cost Â£25 overnight.\nI would definitely return and recommend this to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:35:48.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
