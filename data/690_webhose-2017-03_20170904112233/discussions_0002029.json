However the shower was really powerful and a very relaxing soak. The bed linen made us itch a little but the beds were quite comfy.\nAll in all, despite the carpeted walls and being about 6 decades out of date, this hotel is actually quite alright!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:31:51.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
