Hotel's location is great as its close to museums and other central sight seeing locations in Paris. Also the RER train is close by which you can take to visit the Versailles.\nThe room was lovely and it came with the balcony which overlooked the street. Lots of restaurants/cafes near by.\nTheir spa is nice and you can book it by asking staff. its a nice size pool for 2-3 people and you can take the elevator straight to the basement where its located and then back to your floor once done.\nStaff was very friendly as well. They gave us good recommendations and booked restaurants for us.\nwould definitely consider staying here again in the future!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:22:48.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
