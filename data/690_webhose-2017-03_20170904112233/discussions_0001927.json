It has a lovely design, healthy fresh options for dining (I got hooked on their smoothies), nice business center and state-of-the-art workout area. All rooms are comfortable, well designed for business travelers and have in-room workout areas. Nice large shower. Highly recommend, especially for business travelers, as it's in the heart of Midtown where many businesses are located and a 5-minute train ride from Times Square. They have a rare outdoor patio overlooking the city and loved the grab and go area with fresh orange juicer. Also they have a wristband you can wear as a room key. Be sure to ask for one!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:16:26.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
