We stayed 5 days in paris and it was very easy to commute there. There is a train station just by the corner and the neighborhood is very friendly and with plenty of options to dine.\nThe room was very clean as well as the toilet. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\nBreakfast was included and even tough it wasn't plenty of choices of food, it was very nice. I would strongly recommend this place!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:10:32.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
