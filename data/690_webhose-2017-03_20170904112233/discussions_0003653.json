Later during the day the receptionist gave us a tour of the hotel.\nThe room was medium sized and very well decorated though it could get more natural light. The bed and cushion were really comfortable. The bathroom had a modern shower with very pleasant pressure and several toiletries.\nThere was a small modern swimming pool downstairs with sauna and hammam perfect to relax and unwind after a long day. The spa personnel was very warm.\nThe breakfast was served until 11 with plenty of choices including homemade products perfect to start the day.\nI highly recommend going to this hotel which is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional. The district is really nice and gives a more typical view on Paris", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:46:08.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
