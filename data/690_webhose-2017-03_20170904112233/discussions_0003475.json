Train from Newark to Penn Station New York was easier than anticipated. Penn Station is located under Madison Square Garden which is 3 blocks over and 2 blocks down. Street to hotel is a little scary, somewhat low lit. However nobody bothers you. Front desk was a bit chaotic. One young lady was helping customers while another employee was gossiping and telling customers someone else would help them. Lobby area is very clean as well as room. Location is not bad but room is tight but cozy. Refrigerator, washer and microwave are useful. Price is a little steep for this property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:18:56.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
