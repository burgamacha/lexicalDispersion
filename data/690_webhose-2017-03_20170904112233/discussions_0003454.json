I paid around EUR 120 a night which from my basic research seems reasonable for Paris.\nThe staff are attentive. I needed to print out a train ticket to Zurich and they didn't try to charge anything extra.\nRoom was nice. Water was hot. I prefer a proper shower and not a shower in a bath - just my preference.\nThe hotel has a very annoying wifi system. They don't simply give you the password to the wifi but instead create an account for you which was a bit slow to create. I struggled at first to log into the account and had to give the staff my phone for them to try to get the wifi to work which I don't particularly like doing. When I eventually managed to get into the wifi, it seems to time out after an hour so you have to log back in again. This is annoying. You might be expecting to receive a Whatsapp message and the reason you don't get anything is not because the sender didn't send anything but the wifi has timed out. When the wifi was working, it worked fine and I could watch youtube easily for example.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:31:30.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
