Lobby is nothing to speak of. Room was small but comfortable. My only complaint was the bathroom has no counter or shelf so there is no where to put anything near the sink. NY is a noisy city and the windows are not particularly tight so just don't mind the noise all night long, but it didn't bother me.\nThe front desk staff were very cheerful on check in and check out.\nI didn't use he wifi so I cannot comment. I didn't bother with the morning breakfast because there are better coffee shops all around.\nA really nice feature was being able to precheck in and select my own room online. Nice touch! More hotels need to start doing this.\nOverall for NYC, I thought the price of my room at $120 was amazing. It is not plushy but clean, comfortable and excellent value for a big city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:19:40.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
