Much improved and a much better stay this time around. The staff bent over backwards to accommodate me, upgrading me to a larger room and I was provided with a personalized note from the GM upon entering my room. The team in the 4th floor lounge, including Chaylene and Arianna are amazing and took great care of us. Overall the hotel was well maintained and very clean.
