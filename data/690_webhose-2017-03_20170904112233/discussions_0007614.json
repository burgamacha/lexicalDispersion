Rooms were basic, but had fridge but not tea & coffee facility which wasn't a major problem, but would have been nice after arrival from airport. The power shower was a dream, our room was large enough, King size, although the journeyman rooms were small and perhaps only ideal for one person. Staff were polite and friendly, room serviced each day. Were accommodating to our needs to stay extra days due to flight cancellation. Sufficient Breakfast, didn't taste the sausages though, scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, cereal etc, a choice of fruit and yogurt might of been nice, but again not major, rooftop view was amazing. LLaundry room useful for our stay. Would stay again\nRoom Tip: Perhaps choose a king or queen if staying for longer than a day or so, as journeyman are quite small...
