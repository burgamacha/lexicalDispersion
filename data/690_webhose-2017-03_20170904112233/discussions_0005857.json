Breakfast is very busy and you sometimes have to queue but good selection.\nYou can't beat the hotel for location.10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and 2 minutes from a shopping street.\nOne word of warning - when getting a cab from Orly, we went to the taxi rank and were overcharged by a rogue taxi driver (con artist) and ended up paying euro 70. If getting a cab make sure its a Taxi Parisian! There's a set fee of euro 30. Put a dampener on the start of our holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:40:01.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
