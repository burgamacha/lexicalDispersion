Brompton road is easily accessible, and there are many cafes in the area. We ate out yet wished we had eaten at Apero in the hotel as it's a lovely restaurant. We had breakfast the morning of departure which was fresh and delicious. Every single member of staff was exceptional. The service could not be faulted. Our room was beautifully appointed, very modern and a powerful shower with l'occitaine toiletries. The mini bar has complimentary soft drinks that are replenished regularly. Wonderful hotel and we would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:24:59.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
