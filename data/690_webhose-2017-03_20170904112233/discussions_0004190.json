They didn't know it but I had just had a horrible day at work and a very stressful commute just coming from Rockefeller Center. As soon as I walked in they made me feel at home and got me set up in a Queen Bedroom Suite. It had my own kitchen, living room, 2 BATHROOMS, and separate bedroom. I had my own 1 bedroom apartment in midtown for an incredibly generous price. HIGHLY recommend. I live on long island (NY) and this is my new go to hotel if I do not feel like commuting back home for the night.\nRoom Tip: The suites are totally worth it!
