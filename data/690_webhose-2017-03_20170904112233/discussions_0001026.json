This is the nicest motel property I have ever stayed at. I love that the doors to the rooms are protected by an outer locked corridor that can only be accessed by your room key. The rooms are comfortable, clean and have great amenities. Complimentary breakfast was wonderful and the front desk clerk was so nice and attentive. Free shuttle to SFO airport only about a mile away. I would highly recommend this place!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:33:01.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
