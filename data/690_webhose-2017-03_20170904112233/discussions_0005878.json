The first night, they surprised us with a beautiful token of their congratulations on my graduation. The concierge were always ready to answer any question we had as well as help us with transportation, dining recommendations, and even what the weather would be like. The bar staff in the dining area of the hotel were attentive and very kind in conversation. The rooms were always kept impeccably clean, and our view from 507 was wonderful. I give this hotel and its service the highest of recommendations, and I definitely will be staying here again.\nRoom Tip: Balconies not guaranteed but can be requested See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:28:59.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
