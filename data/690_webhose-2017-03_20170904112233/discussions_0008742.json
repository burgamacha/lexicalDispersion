It is a smaller, charming hotel in a perfect location. The room was not large, but was entirely adequate. The toiletries were Gilchrist & Soames. I loved being able to make coffee in the room, and to have a different type of cookie each night. The tube station is very close, as are several restaurants. Albert Hall, the V&A and the Natural History museum are just a short walk away. The breakfast was good, and staff were pleasant and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:16:45.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
