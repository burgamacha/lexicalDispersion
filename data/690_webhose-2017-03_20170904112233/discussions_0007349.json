Front desk employees were professional and knowledgeable, but looked a little less than that. One lady's name tag was upside down and the concierge was wearing plastic slides.... Our rooms were on the 3rd floor. They were \"superior doubles\" - looked like a regular double to me. No views, but the beds were comfortable and the one of the rooms was quiet. The heater/AC in our other room was rather loud. Bathrooms were smallish, but it is an old hotel. Towels and hairdryer were precariously located above the toilet - an accident waiting to happen! We were also a little befuddled about the $15 Wifi charge....I hear that there will be some remodeling going on later this year to upgrade the rooms and elevators. Free Wifi would be great. A different, more colorful decor (think Dorothy Draper's Greenbrier WV colors) would go a long way to give the old rooms a fresh new look.
