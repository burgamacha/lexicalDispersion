The room was quite cramped. However the staff and service more than made up for it. Nothing was too much trouble. They were always on hand with directions... restaurant recommendations... or to print out train tickets for us. So helpful. Breakfast was lovely. Location is also good. It is very close to the train station and only two stops to Termini, the main train station in Rome. Very happy with our stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:11:09.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
