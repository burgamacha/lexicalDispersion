The Renwick is everything you would expect from a boutique\"ish\" New York City modern luxury hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean, and well planned. The architecture in the lobby is beautiful as well as every piece in the rooms. The paintings are beautifully done and displayed and the attention to detail that was given to something even as small as the pencil holder is incredible. It is refreshing to know that people still take pride in small details that some customers see before seeing anything else. Staff was friendly, helpful and professional. This is a must stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:49:58.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
