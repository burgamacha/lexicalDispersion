They understand customer service! Took time to email lots of location information about a week before we traveled. We had 2 rooms connected (with the doors opened for us already. The staff were beyod helpful with travel advice and wanting to make dinner reservations. They front desk took us to our room to ensure everything was as expected. I was so impressed with their attention to detail and focus (have rarely felt this way even as a diamond member at Hilton - so well done Renaissance!). Staff recommended a great pizza place near by - got us a map - made sure everything was taken care of. Would love to stay at this hotel again. Close to Gare du Nord and metro at doorstep. Lots of shops and restaurants within a short walk as well. Most comfortable bed I slept in the entire trip. Nespresso machine in the room as well. Highly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:14:56.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
