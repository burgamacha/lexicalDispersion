No restaurant in the hotel, but it really doesn't need one (there are many places to eat within moments of leaving the lobby) and you can get a light breakfast delivered to your room.\nMy room, on the top floor, was perfect and just the right size for one traveler. Dead-quiet, very handsomely decorated and appointed, and a rainfall/wand shower that I would have taken home with me if it had fit in my suitcase. The Wifi is free and fast. The kitchenette (hidden behind a cabinet door) is a wonderful addition...especially the Brita faucet.\nThe location of the hotel is excellent: centrally located, across the street from the rear of Buckingham Palace, and yet a few steps down a side street so totally out of the flow of busy sidewalks. To put it another way, step in one direction and you are at Buckingham Palace and in the center of bus lines, tourist buses and moments away from Victoria Station...step in the other direction and you are on a very quiet side street that has two charming pubs (I am looking at you The Cask and Glass) and an excellent Jamie Oliver spot about 7 minutes away, walking.\nThe guest-facing staff, led by Ataur at the Front Desk, were very helpful and pro-active. My only complaint is that on one day my room did not get made up until almost 5 pm...which I think is a bit late in the day. But other than that, everyone was very friendly and professional.\nNot only *would* I stay at the Nadler Victoria again, I *will* stay there again the next time I visit London. It is easily my favorite hotel in the city.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:01:00.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
