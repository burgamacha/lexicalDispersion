The room was very clean, spacious and had a large comfortable bed. There are coffee making facilities in the room which let you brew your own coffee, it was very nice. Our room was cleaned each day to high standards and all the members of staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good, the only negative would be the plastic plates and cutlery. I would definitely return to this hotel as it's location provides easy access to all of New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:54:34.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
