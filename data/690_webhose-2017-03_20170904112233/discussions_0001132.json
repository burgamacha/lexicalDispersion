It's the opposite side of the city to the Vatican, so we opted for a metro ride (â‚¬1.50 each for a single trip - bargain!). Other than that though, everything was within walking distance. As soon as we arrived the guy on reception gave us a great map of the city and circled all the main attractions, which we used throughout the trip. All the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet and wonderfully decorated, and proved a welcome retreat after trying to fit in as many sights as we could in one day! Breakfast was good. There were pastries, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, and fresh coffee - plenty to set us up for the day. The hotel is also just two minutes away from Via Urbana, which has a great selection of restaurants if you're looking for something other than the traditional pizzerias (we'd highly recommend Urbana 47 - very modern, fantastic food, and we managed to catch the house pianist too!).\nAll in all a great place to stay - would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:25:58.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
