The room was as clean as you could want and had better views of the Eiffel tower then i was expecting. Its location was ideal a nice walk away from the tower and plenty of restaurants around. The metro was right out the front door but don't let this put you off as it wasn't noisy or off-putting and we used it every day and coming home to your door step was priceless at the end of a long days sight seeing.\nBut what was the best part of the hotel was by far the staff. They were so welcoming and friendly with fantastic advice of visits and food. They gave us 2 dinner suggestions both brilliant and even went the extra mile and booked us a table at a brilliant restaurant by the tower.\nwe both thank you very much First hotel staff, we had a wonderful stay.\nRoom 305- 24-26 feb\nRoom Tip: pay for the view, its worth it. The higher floor the better. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:45:02.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
