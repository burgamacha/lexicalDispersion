First, we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite from a junior suite. The room was great with 2 bathrooms, living room and kitchenette. The kitchen had a combination washer dryer which we did use once. It was also stocked with Nespresso, tea and milk for the coffee. The bathrooms had heated towel racks. The only negative is that you can't use a hair dryer or curling iron in the bathroom. Minor inconvenience.\nThe service went above and beyond. After the first day the concierges knew you by name. A shout out to Alex, Jon, Vassi and Kalman who were all very helpful.\nEvery evening they had a complimentary happy hour from 6-7 PM with top shelf liquor, wine and beer and bar snacks. Adson and some of the girls (I forgot their names) took very good care of us.\nThe location is perfect. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Parliament. The was a subway station close by and bus stops everywhere.\nWe did not eat any meals at the hotel so I can't comment on the food.\nI thought the prices were very fair for the value that you received. If you want a larger room than just a standard room with 5 star service and amenities don't hesitate to stay here! This is also a great place for families because of all of the extra space and the kitchenette. You'll be happy you did!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:21:38.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
