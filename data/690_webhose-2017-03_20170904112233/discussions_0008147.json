True to its name, the hotel is near the Forum and Colosseum with easy access to other Rome tourist spots, stores, and restaurants.\nIt's quiet with a lovely decor. Room and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. However its biggest asset is the entire staff: friendly, caring, tolerant of my bad Italian (!) -- lovely people who want guests to have a terrific visit. Many choices at breakfast ... hot and cold, and eggs cooked to your request.\nAbsolutely wonderful!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:27:03.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
