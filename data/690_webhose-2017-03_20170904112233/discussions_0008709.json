I laughed out loud when I saw our room. For Americans it is tiny.\nHaving said that, everything else about the hotel was very nice. Beds were nice and soft and had 2 pillows ea on a twin. Shower was new, had good pressure and plenty of heat.\nStaff was outstanding. Got a great referral from Mauro on a place to buy a jacket.\nLocation is good too, although a hair tricky to find the first time. Close to lots of places to eat, the Tube and a HOHO bus stop.\nOverall, we worth what we paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:08:03.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
