I stayed here with my mom and we arrived way before check in time but the staff went above and beyond and got a room ready for us immediately. During our wait they even allowed us to get breakfast, which was amazing. We missed our flights and so we decided to stay another night in Rome and they were so accommodating and helped us with a room for another night. Stayed in two different rooms (one with balcony facing plaza barberini and other without) and both were equally fantastic rooms. Amazing service/staff and location. Centrally located next to a metro stop. 10 minute walk to Trevi fountain, 15 mins to spanish steps and pantheon and about 30 mins walk (or metro ride away) from colosseum. On check out day they let us keep our bags there until we were heading out and helped us book a taxi to the airport. Will definitely stay here again! Thank you for the amazing stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:35:37.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
