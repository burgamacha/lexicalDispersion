They were welcoming and made everything very easy. The room was exactly as shown in pictures on their website, in fact, it exceeded my expectations. We got the junior suite and having stayed in Paris many times before, found that this is far larger than most places. The decor of the room was gorgeous, the bed was very comfortable and the lobby decor was stunning. The hotel is located 2 minutes from many major metro stations making everything extremely easy to navigate. As well, it is in a beautiful part of the city so it is live every evening with many options for late meals/drinks. Will always stay here from now on!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:30:44.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
