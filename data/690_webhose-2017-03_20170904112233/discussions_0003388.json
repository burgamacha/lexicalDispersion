We got a shared shuttle from the airport to outside the door for 35euros for both of us - perfect! The hotel is cute, clean, and modern. We booked a budget room so yes it was small but the bed was big and comfy and we don't expect to spend a lot of time in our room when in beautiful Rome! The location was perfect, right by the Roman Forum and very close to walk anywhere really, we didn't need a taxi at all for our whole stay. We could even walk to the Vatican which took approx 30 mins. We shared a continental breakfast each day which was delicious and brilliant value, and the complementary afternoon tea was very welcome after a long day walking the city. Staff very friendly and helpful. Good value when booked in advance. Over all - fab!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:11:10.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
