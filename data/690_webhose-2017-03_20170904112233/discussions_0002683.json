The lobby has been remodeled since I last visited. The lobby seemed a bit smaller but adequate. There is a small cafe and the bar turns into a breakfast/coffee bar in the morning. The hotel staff is super friendly. The best part of this hotel is the location. We easily walked to The Barrymore theater and the Eugene O'Neill theater to see some Broadway shows. You can also walk to several other popular sights or catch the hop on, hop off bus right outside.\nThis is the perfect suite when traveling with a teenager. The separate bedroom, living room and spacious bathroom is nice to have. It's very spacious compared to other NYC hotels. The decor was updated, clean and tasteful. The living room has a small refrigerator and microwave in a bar area with sink if you want to bring food back to your room. There is no food room service in the hotel. The king size bed was very comfortable. The pull out sofa bed in the living was also comfortable for my teen. We had a nice city view located on the 32 floor. Traffic noise was minimal and not too disturbing at night. The rooms seemed nicely insulated. I will definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:49:46.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
