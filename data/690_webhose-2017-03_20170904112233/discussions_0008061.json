The room was modern, clean and quiet, bed was comfortable and the full kitchen included a clothes washer/dryer. Bath was large, clean and had a great shower with thick towels. The staff was always helpful. I was also pleasantly surprised by the variety offered at breakfast (worth the 10 pounds charged if you do not include it in your room). Also liked the central location - within two blocks of the Victoria and Albert and Natural History museums, many good restaurants and two food markets as well as a tube station. The wifi was free and the bandwidth was good. I'll stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:43:08.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
