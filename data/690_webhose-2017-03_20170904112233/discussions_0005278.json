Caroline and Matthew canâ€™t stop talking about our trip. You certainly made their first visit to the City of Light one they will always remember.\nI have attached a poor quality photo of our dog Jigger as we gave him the wonderful blanket you had made with his name on it. We are thinking of tying it into a scarf for him. Very French!\nJean-Marie, we consider you a friend. Le Bristol will be our Paris home in the years to come. And please let us know if you visit the states as we would be honored to return the hospitality.\nYours Truly,\nTimothy, Ann, Caroline and Matthew Mikula", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:47:57.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
