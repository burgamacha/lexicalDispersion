It's only $26 for 24 hours, which I think especially for this location is an amazing deal. The hotel is right in Times Square, so the location is perfect also. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful - and I mean everyone from the people at the front desk to the people working in the breakfast area. I don't know about their rates for the rest of the year, but I thought the price per night was great, especially since it also includes breakfast (which is also decent - toast, bagels, waffles, pancakes, cereal, so plenty of options). The size of our room was good considering it's New York City, but we had a king bed, so I'm not sure if all rooms are like that. We had no concerns regarding the cleanliness, although overall aspect is a little dated. I would come back to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:05.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
