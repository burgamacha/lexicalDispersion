This hotel was the best choice. It's a historical building with a touch of modernity inside (ex spa, garden setting). We took a superior room and it was very big and perfectly cleaned. The bathroom was really nice and full of Occitane products (very good smell). The position is great, city center. We didn't try the breakfast of the hotel tough.\nThe concierge and the receptionist were all very nice (exept of the blond girl with red glasses very unpolite only because we left our key in the morning).\nWe will book again this hotel for our parisian visits!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:53:19.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
