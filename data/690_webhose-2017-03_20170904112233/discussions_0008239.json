We came in on the Acela and the Arlo is perfectly located a few blocks away - in the middle of plenty of restaurants, bars and fun. However, it was a snowy, cold night and the ice covered sidewalks discouraged us from wandering outside after we checked in. So we decided to settle for the hotel bar and restaurant.\nWow. We were so pleasantly surprised at how delicious, hip, and fun both the bar and the restaurant were. The food and cocktails were impeccable. We are making it a point to visit Massoni next time we visit NYC.\nAnyways, we had a late night. By the time we headed up to the room the weather had cleared and all that was left was an amazing view of the skyline from our 29th floor room. The bed was comfortable, the room was modern and clean, and again - dat view in the morning.\nI highly recommend this hotel for people who want more than just a bed to sleep on. I can't stress enough how great this hotel is.\nRoom Tip: try the restaurant See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:59:33.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
