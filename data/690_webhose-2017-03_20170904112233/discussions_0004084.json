Almost as good as last time. We had booked a bigger room in a corner, but they gave as a very small one, in the middle of the corridor. Some small arguing before they gave us the one we had paid for. The rooms are nice, but nothing exclusive and it looks like they may need some refreshing. We really appreciated the fitness center, big enough and well equipped. Their is a nice bar and a very good restaurant in the ground floor. The best I think, is where this hotel is situated, close to Madison Square Garden and lots of shopping, as Macy's for example.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:43:58.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
