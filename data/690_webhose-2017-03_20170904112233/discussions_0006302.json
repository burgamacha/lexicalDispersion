Easy walk to MSG and easy walk to Times Square and even easier to the Empire State Building. The room was small - as we expected, but it was perfect for our needs. Breakfast was your standard HIE fare and there was just enough seating in the breakfast area that we didn't feel too crowded. Nice restaurants around the hotel and a good area to stay in. 36th street wasn't too busy, so traffic in front of the hotel wasn't bad. We would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Get a higher level for better views.
