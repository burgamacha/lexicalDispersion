The staff are professional and delightful. The hotel is clean, quiet, and everything we hoped for. It's a small hotel, only 13 rooms, but it was quaint and a good location for hopping on the metro and enjoying the sites of the city. We will stay here again!\nThanks to the staff for a pleasant stay!\n-Nicole", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:02:07.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
