We were placed on 62nd floor and we were blown away by the view. The room is typical size for NYC. Bathroom is spacious. The room is very classy. Bed is comfy. Pillows are very soft. A little too soft for me but there were 6 of them on the bed. Room has amenities galore for NYC. We had stocked dishes, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and microwave. Floor to Ceiling window on 2 sides creating an amazing view of Central Park. We were treated to a snowstorm on our first night and watching the snowfall from our 62nd floor room was something we will never forget. Great Central location within a couple blocks of Ties Square and on same street as Studio 54 and The Iguana. Just a couple blocks from Subway. Housekeeping was spot-on. Staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful.\nRoom Tip: Higher the floor the better.
