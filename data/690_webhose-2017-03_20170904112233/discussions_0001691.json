It is really spacious and the service is just superb! I felt so welcomed by the hotel staff and they made you feel at home immediately. And thanks to the great recommendation of the best Chinese restuarant in Paris.\nI also need to mention that there was a night I was craving for a glass of milk to go with my muffin. As it was Sunday, 22 January 2017, all the supermarket was closed. The gentleman at the counter went to get a glass of milk for me from the hotel pantry! I was really touched.\nI am sorry to say I did not get his name but he reminded me of Jeremy Irons :). Thank you so much to you and your colleagues for the great time and I'll definitely be back soon :)", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:04:02.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
