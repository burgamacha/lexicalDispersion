It's a lovely property in a great location. The rooms were quite large by European standards - light, airy and very comfortable. Xavier and the desk staff are very attentive and kind and made excellent restaurant recommendations. We had two adjoining rooms on the street side of the hotel with balconies - the church bells across the street confused us at first (we were napping after we arrived on our transatlantic flight and thought it was a doorbell) but it became a nice way of keeping track of time. And, they don't ring at night:) The only con I could mention was the water pressure - it wasn't great in either shower or to fill the Japanese tub and the temperature control was very touchy. We had a great family holiday overall and would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:00:14.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
