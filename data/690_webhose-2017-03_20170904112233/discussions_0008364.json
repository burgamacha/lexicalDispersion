It's by the metro and there are nice restaurants around the area.\nThe hotel is about a 25-30 min walk from the Eiffel Tower, which my boyfriend and I did once since the weather was nice (not a bad walk at all). On the train it was about 20 min away from major sites. And cabs/ubers were also really cheap to and from the hotel.\nIt's pretty modern/up-to-date but my room was so small. We couldn't unpack because there wasn't any space/drawers, and we had to work around getting our clothes in and out the luggage. The bathroom was a good space, and the room was overall well kept. We were in room 603. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was beautiful and I checked it out each morning and every night while I was there but I think I would have given up the view if it meant more space.\nThe breakfast is ok, nothing great but not terrible. If you get a room without breakfast included I would suggest going out to a restaurant or finding a bakery rather than paying for the breakfast at the hotel. If you do have breakfast included, no worries - the food isn't bad, typical eggs and pastries just don't expect too much.\nI would definitely stay again, maybe in a different room but overall it's a very nice and clean hotel, in a great location.\nRoom Tip: 603 had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower, but beware... it's a very tight space.
