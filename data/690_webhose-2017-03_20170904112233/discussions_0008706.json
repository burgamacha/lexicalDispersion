Everyone we met was extremely friendly and welcoming, asking us if there was any help they could provide. A great credit to themselves and heaven help our hotel industry if Brexit leads to a loss of European staff. Our room featured a massive bed and the bathrooom was absolutely spotless. We were less enamoured with the grey laminate flooring which we felt gave the room a rather cold and drab appearance. No doubt someone, somewhere thought it was a good idea to go with it! Still, we weren't there much and the most important thing was that we had a good night's sleep- which we did. Breakfast was lovely and, again, the staff were most attentive and the food was plentiful. Our target during the day was the V&A which is best reached by cutting through the grounds of Imperial College on the other side of the street but directly opposite the hotel. This removes the need to cut through the crowds on the nearby main road meandering around trying to find the way into the Natural History Museum. Would be quite happy to stay here again if we got another good deal on the room.\nRoom Tip: We had a room at the back of the hotel and experienced no noise disturbance See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:38:48.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
