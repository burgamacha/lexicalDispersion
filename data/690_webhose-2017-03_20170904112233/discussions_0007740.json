My partner and I had a great time exploring the city for her birthday. The hotel was in a great location to everything and the staff were all really helpful and nice. Check in was smooth and quick however didn't accept our English bank card for $50 refundable deposit which was slightly annoying. Hotel was under renovation so builder where around but didn't really notice them. The Bed was really comfy and facilities were adequate, although the building opposite our room was being worked on and even at 3am there were builders banging and hammering which woke us up! It really is a city that doesn't sleep. We would stay here again, it perfect if your just wanting a place to sleep and shower whilst exploring! Oh and too note, Point Break Bar one block down towards Times Square is ana amazing bar & Fresh & Co a deli on 34th street west is amazing for breakfasts", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:26:15.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
