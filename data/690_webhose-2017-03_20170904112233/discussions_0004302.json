Interiors look quite new and modern, with giant paintings on the wall, building an authentic atmosphere for the room. Basic room is quite small but has everything you need. Although we stayed at the 2nd floor, it wasn't noisy as I was scared. Breakfast is at the eur restaurant next to hotel and variety is just enough. It's easy to come from airport by bus (8 euros return) or by train. You can walk around to every sightseeing without need of a metro ride. I would return to this hotel for the next visit to Rome\nRoom Tip: If you are not comfortable with small rooms, ask for a bigger room See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:42:23.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
