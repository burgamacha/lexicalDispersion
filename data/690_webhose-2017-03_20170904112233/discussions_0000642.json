From the greeting at the door to the fabulous rooms and their amenities it was such a pleasure to stay at this little gem. DÃ©cor was fresh and interesting . Common areas were bright and cheery but could be intimate also. Noise canceling shades were very effective although a somewhat quiet street compared to other parts of Paris. The restaurant is unbelievable and sommelier knows his wines very well. Definitely a great property on the right bank for convenient walking to the Opera, shopping, the Seine and multiple restaurants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:57:37.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
