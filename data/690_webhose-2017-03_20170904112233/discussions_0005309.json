We were on the 4th floor and slept well every night with no noise. The bathroom was a good size too and the whole room was clean and well maintained. We had a coffee machine in our room and there are water machines with empty bottles on each floor. There are also complimentary refreshments on the ground floor - tea, coffee, soft drinks, nuts, fresh fruit. We were close to the subway and the 9/11 museum/memorial. Also close to a great pub called O'Hara's which is worth a visit. No complaints whatsoever and would happily stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:35:43.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
