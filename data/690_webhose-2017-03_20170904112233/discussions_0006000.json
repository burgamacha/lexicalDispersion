The gal at the front desk was the most helpful person, showing me my room and pointing out the features. She also gave me some awesome restaurant advice. It's a perfect location if you want to be near all of the theatres. I did pick a cheaper room above the bar which indeed is a bit noisy, but I can't deduct from my review since I was warned. The bed was comfortable so I was able to sleep well. I would not hesitate to stay again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:18:46.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
