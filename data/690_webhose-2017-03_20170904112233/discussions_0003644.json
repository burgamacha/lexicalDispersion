The d√©cor and fittings are very cool and such a nice change from other hotels.\nReceived a lovely welcome, the staff were all very helpful (even with information before I arrived there). Breakfast was excellent.\nThe hotel is really well located - you're away from the mega hustle & bustle, but still so very central. You're less than 10mins walk to the nearest Metro stations, or about 15mins to Bastille. There is also an abundance of restaurants, cafes, bakeries and grocery shops in the area.\nI will definitely re-book this hotel for my next trip to Paris! Thanks for the great service :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:59:23.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
