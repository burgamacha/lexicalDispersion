We were looking for a small romantic hotel. Somewhere that gives the \"London Feel\" and not an industrial place that can be located anywhere. The Ashburn was a perfect choice. A small hotel located a 5 minutes walk from an underground station, a very friendly neighbourhood with lot's of places to eat or hang out. We landed at Heathrow and took the tube to the hotel, so that was very convenient. The room wasn't big but well designed and very comfortable. Breakfast was good. Not a big variety but good quality and it gave us a nice start for the day. The service was excellent and everyone on the staff was happy to help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:13:46.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
