It is clean, quiet, roomy, comfortable and staffed by the most courteous people! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a charming older hotel which is very well-maintained. Close to everything you could possibly need or want in New York. Many thanks to the staff who made us feel welcome!\nTip - wear comfortable shoes to NYC because you will be doing a lot of walking! Or, opt for a yellow cab - they are plentiful and do not cost a lot of money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:11:24.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
