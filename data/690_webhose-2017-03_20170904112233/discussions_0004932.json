Beautiful decor with a comfortable room. Felt very safe in the neighbourhood. Hotel about a 90 second walk from Cadet metro station. There is also a McDonalds, Starbucks, Patisserie, Boulangerie and supermarket all within a couple of minutes walking. We did not use the breakfast service, which was â‚¬15 per person, as it worked out far cheaper using other local options instead. There is a small minibar in the room with space for you to put your own water in the fridge. The only thing I thought was slightly odd was the total lack of any drawers for your stuff in the hotel room. Literally not one drawer. We were only there for two nights and so we managed by storing stuff in our travel bags. However, if you had a longer stay this could be tricky. The bathroom was beautifully clean and spacious. We had a large double shower with a waterfall head. The shower had coloured lighting installed which we really liked. There was also a really powerful hairdryer to use. Weak hairdryers are a pet peeve of mine and this one was a pleasant surprise. The staff were very accommodating. They took care of our bags both when we arrived and after we checked out. They were even happy for us to camp out there for a few hours yesterday whilst we were waiting to leave for the airport, which was very kind. Would not hesitate to go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:10:09.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
