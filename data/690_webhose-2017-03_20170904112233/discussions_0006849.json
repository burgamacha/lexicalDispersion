Items such as scrambled eggs are not served.\nRevolving door in the entrance trapped trash from the wind. Not a big deal but easy to fix and make reception more inviting.\nRoom Tip: Corner room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:49:25.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
