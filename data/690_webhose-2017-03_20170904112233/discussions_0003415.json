The Hotel Beacon is right next door and was perfect. Our room was spacious (bigger than the apartment we had when we lived in the city) with a kitchenette, a separate living area, and the bedroom. We were on the 10th floor and while we didn't have the best view in the hotel, our room had lots of light and still had a decent view of NYC. Check-in was smooth and everyone was pleasant. We had dinner at a lovely little Italian restaurant around the corner. We stopped in at the hotel bar before the concert and met other concert goers. All in all, a great experience.\nIf you were traveling with a family this would be a great set-up. There is a great grocery store across the street, which could be a great savings with the kitchenette. The size of the rooms are unusually large for a city. (We had stayed at a lovely hotel in Brooklyn recently whose rooms dwarfed in comparison to the size of the rooms at The Hotel Beacon).\nWe signed up for a Beacon Rewards program before we left because we will definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:01:33.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
