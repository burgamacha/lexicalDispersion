The staff on the whole are very helpful, and efficient. Ivy who works in the Italian restaurant really went out of her way to look after me, not just at dinner but helped with finding out which metro I should get and everything, it was so sweet of her.\nSome of the staff their English is not too fluent to say it is an international hotel, but my Chinese is none existence so shouldn't complain.\nI ate at the hotel every night in the Grand Caf√© mostly, and the food was really good, and so was the service, he only exception was the service in the bar/Japanese restaurant, and the service was slow, and the servicing staff could have been nicer especially one lady in particular who I felt was rude.\nThe spa facilities are excellent, so relaxing, especially after three days of sightseeing and smog! The hotel is very close to some of the main attractions in Beijing and is attached to the Oriental Plaza, fabulous if you like shopping.\nRoom Tip: If you like English tea, then take your own, tea arrives in a cafetiere, and its quite bitter.
