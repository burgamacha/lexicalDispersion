We are planning to go back to that same hotel with our family and future kids. Excellent customer service and cleanliness. I love the bed and the bathroom. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, they got us champagne as an engagement gift, they even lent us adapters for our outlets. We had a room with the view of the Eiffel Tower. At night is so romantic because the light show is amazing. My fianc√©e was so happy and satisfied. The best thing is that there is a supermarket across the street, many local restaurants. Our favorite was LeBosque. There is also a Metro station right in front of the**** Hotel. And lastly everything is close including the Eiffel Tower only minutes away. Love this Hotel", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:47:37.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
