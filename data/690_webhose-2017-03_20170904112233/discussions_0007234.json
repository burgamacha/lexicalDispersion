The rooms are very small, but the design of the bed with the extending shelves and drawer makes good use of what little space there is. Free coffee and tea provided in the lobby area is great. The hotel is a few mins walk away from shops and restaurants at Spitalfields Market, and maybe a 10 minute walk to Aldgate East or Liverpool Street stations. Not too far from the station, but if you're bringing a lot of luggage, then it may be a bit inconvenient. We stayed at the hub in St James's Park Westminster after for another 2 nights, which is more central in terms of touristy areas, and a lot closer to the underground station, but at a slightly higher cost, you may want to check out the other locations as well to weigh out the cost/convenience/location. The rooms were exactly the same between locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:25:31.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
