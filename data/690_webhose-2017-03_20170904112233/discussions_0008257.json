No car park but you can park in the Multi Storey for the Shopping Centre and it is Â£9.50 for 24hrs which isn't bad for London. Clean and tidy hotel, breakfast was manic as the area where the food was served was very small in comparison to the hotel itself. Great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:23:25.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
