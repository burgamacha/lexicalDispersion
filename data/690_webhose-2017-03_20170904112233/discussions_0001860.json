The rooms are compact but fabulously furnished. bathrooms are great.\nBreakfast is served on the 4th floor and in nice weather can be taken outside.\nThe real asset to this hotel is it's staff. From check in (a lot of great information provided to us first time visitors to Rome) to the breakfast staff, everyone is super friendly and helpful.\nThe lovely Victoria behind the bar deserves a special mention... not only is she very friendly and chatty, she also mixes a mean Espresso martini!\nWe will certainly be back !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:53:37.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
