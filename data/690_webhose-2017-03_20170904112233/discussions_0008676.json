The location of this hotel is excellent! It is within walking distance of most NYC tourist sites and 2 blocks from the metro for those attractions that are not within walking distance. The staff was extremely helpful. The concierge and front desk staff were very friendly and answered many questions for us regarding getting around the city. Some reviews mentioned that the hotel was noisy, which may be on the lower floors. We stayed on the 11th floor and the noise didn't interfere with our sleep! There is a fire station nearby, so we did occasionally hear sirens, but when we made it to the room in the evenings, we were exhausted and slept very soundly. The beds and pillows are comfy, there was a charging station in the room and the bathroom was clean and there was a counter at the lav (last NYC hotel I stayed in had a pedestal sink in the bathroom and counter space was lacking). The only complaint I can think of is that the rooms could use better lighting. If there are more than 1 females attempting to get ready at the same time, makeup lighting is very little outside the bathroom. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:51:40.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
