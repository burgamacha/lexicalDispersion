The hotel and the staff are delightful. Our room was immaculate, well-appointed and beautifully decorated. The staff were so helpful, both prior to our visit when we made email enquiries, and during our stay. Nothing is too much trouble and it is evident that the staff are a great team. They advised us on local restaurants and theatre shows, and we sampled their famous Martinis! The hotel is in an excellent location in Knightsbridge, just a short walk from Harrods. I have no hesitation at all in recommending The Egerton House Hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:40:23.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
