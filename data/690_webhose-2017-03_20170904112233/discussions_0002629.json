This hotel is located at a very good location. Surrounded by all the great restaurants in Soho area, I am totally ok with the fact that they don't have a restaurant in the hotel. You can easily grab any cuisines within walking distance.\nThe room is spacious and clean. Staffs are all friendly and helpful.\nThe hotel is very close to tube stations. Plenty of bus lines go around the area. And shopping areas such as Oxford Street and Regent Street are all within walking distance.\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who visit London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:54:15.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
