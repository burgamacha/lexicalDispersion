The staff have always been consistent from then until now. They will have the warmest greetings when you come, they are also pretty much initiative to help you.

Location wise, it's a 10-15 minute walk from Rockefeller and half an hour to time square. You've got Panda Express round the block and some Duane reade which opens 24/7 on the other end.
