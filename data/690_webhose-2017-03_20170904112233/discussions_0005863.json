It is right by the Dupliex Metro so very easy to get around. You can walk to the Eiffel Tower within 10 minutes with many shops, restaurants and bars on the way.\nThe receptionist ( I didn't get his name) but was lovely, extremely friendly and helpful. He provided me with a map and listed a few restaurants we should go to.\nThe room was very clean and bed very comfy. The rooms are quite small but it's perfect for a small trip to Paris. I am a travel agent and will be recommending this hotel to anyone that enquirers about Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:57:24.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
