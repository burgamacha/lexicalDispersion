The room met our expectations and needs. The beds were very comfortable and the room very clean. The property is new so was very up together. There is no car park at present, but we parked at the recommended station which was about a 20 minute walk - and only Â£3.70 for 2 days!!\nThere was plenty of choice at breakfast and it was all a reasonable price.\nThe staff deserve a mention due to the way that they coped following a power cut in the local area which left the hotel without a lift. The staff team pulled together, offering assistance to anyone that needed help going up or down the stairs - and all with a smile!\nI will certainly consider staying here again on our next family trip to London as the hotel is located a short distance from the tube making it very easy to get into central London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:27:21.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
