The staff replied quickly to emails prior to our arrival and assisted in arranging taxis and other bookings as required.\nThe hotel is a cute boutique hotel with very nicely arranged rooms. The character and design of the room was really charming.\nThe location of the hotel is wonderful. It is close to Termini Station as well as an even closer Metro stop. We walked to all main sights from the hotel and there is plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby.\nThe included breakfast at the restaurant next door was lacking some variety but was reasonable and the coffee was great and made to order.\nAll-in-all we had a wonderful stay at Dharma Hotel and would definitely consider staying again if we visit Rome in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:43:35.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
