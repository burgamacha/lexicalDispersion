Just a short walk from Termini, it's situated in a very ideal area and there was no need to book an expensive taxi ride or shuttle from FCO airport. Getting here was seamless on the train. I was worried about the beds being too hard as some reviews have mentioned by did not find it to be a problem but everyone has their own preference. Be sure to reach out to the reception desk and they will do whatever it takes to resolve it. We had an unpleasant odor coming from the bathroom drains and the staff fought to resolve it. When the issue returned we were able to change rooms. Our small double room had the cutest balcony and it was great to have some fresh air flowing in the room.\nWe utilized the buffet breakfast and although not particularly anything outstanding, it got the job done and was the perfect option to fuel up before our morning tours. We dined in one night for a late night snack and cocktail. The food was good (burger and mozzarella tomato panini (they forgot the basil on my sandwich but no big deal).\nWe also tried the self serve vending machine to get wine. Both times it malfunctioned, but a staff member came to help.\nDespite minor hiccups, I'd gladly come again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:47:37.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
