A warm welcome to start by the lovely gentleman at reception. They give you a handy guide of good places to eat in the area and how to get to the main attractions. This was very useful to us. Our room was lovely and clean, comfy bed. Room was cleaned and made up every day. Great amenities including a dressing gown and slippers. A newly renovated bathroom I believe, lovely bath and rainfall shower. We decided to treat ourselves one day and had breakfast in bed, very good also and arrived on the time we choose. One of the best hotels I've stayed in for hospitality and cleanliness. Also, very soundproof it appears, I slept well. I would stay here again on another visit to Paris.
