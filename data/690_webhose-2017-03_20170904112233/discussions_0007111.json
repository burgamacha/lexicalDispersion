The staff were warm and friendly, they helped with preparing baby food in the middle of the night and made the stay for the family easy and comfortable. The room was just about right with a squeeze to fit the baby cot upstairs and perfect for the toddler downstairs. Am happy to recommend and stay there again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:40:16.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
