There is no lift and a narrow staircase so carrying our heavy bags up the stairs was a bit of a hassle. We had a front room and the first few nights slept with the window open because we needed fresh air and it was a bit noisy as it is on a busy street however when we closed the window it was much quieter and we slept better. Rooms were clean and serviced daily. I would not hesitate to stay here again if I am ever lucky enough to travel to London again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:52:29.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
