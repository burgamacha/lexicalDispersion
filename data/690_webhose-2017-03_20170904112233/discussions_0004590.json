The hotel is located on a quiet side street about five minutes walk from the main train station - great location for getting the train to and from the airport however it is a little out of the center. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, always willing to answer any questions and give great recommendations. There were a variety of options for breakfast, I personally really enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice every morning. The room itself was clean but pretty basic however it did the job for a short city break. Overall we enjoyed our stay here but if you are looking to walk to the main attractions such as the Colosseum it is around a 30 minute walk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:28:07.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
