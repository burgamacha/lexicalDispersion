The rooms are clean with bathroom newer styled modern. Flat screen TV and WIFI in the room. Breakfast downstairs has fresh food a bit better than continental style. if you can get it included best, as not really 15.5 euros worth. the staff is helpful, and always at their post. 24 hour maintained so if you have young adults it is okay to come and go at night. Tour Eiffel blocks away, 2 metro stations, and great restaurants right there, Rue cler too. Only negative was if people shower in middle of night, you can hear all depending where your room is located.\nRoom Tip: choose a room facing the street or opposing other side of hotel.
