But I just had to post about this wonderful historic hotel, right in the heart of everything! I can't say enough about it! We stayed last June for 5 nights, and originally had reserved a private apartment in Paris, which fell through at the last minute. Scrambling to find accommodations for myself, my 15 year-old niece and sister-in-law, I felt fortunate to get a reservation here for two double rooms. The rooms were small but oh so charming. Clean accommodations with modern bathrooms. We were very comfortable. The history of the hotel was fascinating -- I guess it was the residence of the mistress of Francois I, King of France. There was part of an underground passageway or tunnel that had been partially dug out, with plexi-glass over the top, so you can peer in and let your imaginings run wild! Maybe the King visited his mistress via this tunnel?? I wish I had inquired of the staff, all of whom were very friendly and accommodating. Had a bit of trouble operating the air conditioning, but they were happy to assist. The location is in the heart of Paris and walking distance to so many sites, including Notre Dame. There is a very good restaurant right next door and a bar open at night in the alley a short distance away. Yes, it could get a bit noisy at night but this just added to the Latin Quarter ambience and made me feel young and alive again! Next time I think I'll join them! They also seemed to quiet down at a reasonable hour so we were not really disturbed at all. Felt safe walking around in the evening and used Uber several times to get around and felt very comfortable doing so. Also the petite dejeuner was lovely with great coffee. I can't wait to stay here again and plan another trip hopefully next year for my other niece!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:00:01.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
