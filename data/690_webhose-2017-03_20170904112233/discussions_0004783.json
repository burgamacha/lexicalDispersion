We there for six days while we visited all of the sites we could in Paris. The rooms are small, but honestly, we were not there much during the day. That is because we went out to see as many things as we could see. I am short, so the bathtub was a little high for me, but once I located the handrail inside the tub just under the shower door, I held on to that. The rooms are very modern and well cleaned. The beds are very comfortable! There are lots of sidewalk cafes and small shops near.This is within walking distance of the Seine River and Notre Dame. You are also close to bus stops and the Metro system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:53:31.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
