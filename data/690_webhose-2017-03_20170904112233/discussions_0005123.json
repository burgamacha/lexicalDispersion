This place rocks. Clean, spacious bedrooms with workout gear (if you care, I'm a lazy bum but it makes me feel better to know I have a yoga mat if I want it) and an amazing staff that makes sure you're well taken care of. The location is central to subways (ACE) and isn't smack dab in Times Square, thank god. This hotel isn't for any bourgeoise travelers who need a fancy schmancy hotel experience, but if you want a comfortable, clean and cost effective experience, stay here. You can thank me later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:40:38.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
