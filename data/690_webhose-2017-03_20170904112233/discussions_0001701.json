I wanted to stay downtown and was excited that the Beekman had just opened. I cannot say enough about the architectural beauty of this hotel. It truly feels like you are stepping back in time when you visit, but with all of the comforts of a modern hotel. The iron work in the atrium, tiles, and ceilings are all restored. The rooms are small but so comfortable. The bathrooms are especially stunning and the Le Labo bath products are a treat.\nAnd I can't say enough about the staff. The doormen were especially welcoming and helpful, and remembered us every time we came back to the hotel, always asking us what we had done for the day and giving advice and tips. The housekeeping staff was great.\nNew York has so many hotels to choose from, but what really sets the Beekman apart is its beauty, wonderful staff, welcoming \"homey\" feel, and convenient location.\nRoom Tip: for quiet, request room not on the atrium See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:59:55.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
