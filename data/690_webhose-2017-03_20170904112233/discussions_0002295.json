Very friendly staff and very good service throughout. They will always tell you that they've upgraded you but I am not sure how true that is... it's cute though!\nRooms are clean and tidy... and tiny but hey, this is Paris after all!\nAbout the location, it is ideal if you need to get on a train at the St Lazare station (less than 5mn walk). Also close to many restaurants and major department stores (FNAC, Galleries Lafayette, Printemps).\nBreakfast is served in a small room in the basement with a nice selection of pastries, fresh baguette, cereals but no warm dish.\nLast, you can get a fairly cheap and very comfortable shuttle arranged to go to Roissy Airport. Great service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:57:19.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
