I arrive and I feel I have come home. It's absolutely lovely and an especially nice vibe in busy New York. I love staying on the Upper West Side. It's very easy to get anywhere in the city by train or taxi. And being near Central Park is awesome. Tons of restaurants and cafes and great shops on every street. And proximity and ease to get to LaGuardia is a major plus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:19:22.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
