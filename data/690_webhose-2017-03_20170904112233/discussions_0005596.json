It's an experience, not just a hotel. We subsequently stayed in two other top ranked 5-star hotels, but none of them could measure up to the Lanzerac.\nThe refurbished room was eloquently planned to the dime, the spa was amazing and included in the room price. We loved the cellar tour and wine tasting. The restaurant was excellent and the pool bar a relaxing end to our day. We spent our whole first day at the Lanzerac and if we could turn back time, our whole honeymoon would have been spent at the Lanzerac.\nIt's a must!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:09:50.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
