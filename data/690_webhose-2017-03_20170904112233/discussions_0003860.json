Beautifully designed, industrial look. Staff was AMAZING. Everyone is very attentive to the needs of guests. Food was delicious. You can tell the owners are Foodies. Both breakfast and All Day menu was superb. Managed to eat several meals there due to length of time and weather conditions (snow). Every dish was good and portions are perfect. The bed was very comfortable. We had adjoining rooms for kids and both rooms equally comfortable. Great view of the city. It was cold outside and the hotel was clearly built well. No drafts and air flow was comfortable.\nRoom Tip: Request a City view!
