The staff was incredible - so kind, so welcoming, and extremely helpful. They knew my name and greeted me as a friend every time I came back or left for the day, which made me feel at home for the week I stayed there. The rooms are beautiful-- very clean, bright and with beautiful bathrooms. The lobby and restaurant are very nice as well and very clean. Above all, it is the people who work there who made my stay so great. Next time I come back to Paris, I will absolutely stay there and I look forward to getting that opportunity! Thanks for the great experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:00:34.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
