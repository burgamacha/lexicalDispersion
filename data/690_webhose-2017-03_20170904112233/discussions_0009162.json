It is within walking distance of the tube, Kensington Gardens, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Harrod's.\nThe room was cosy and comfortable. It was equipped with a refrigerator, which was nice, however it did not stay powered when the room card was removed from the wall. This rendered it useless.\nThe staff was pleasant, and tried to be helpful, but didn't follow through. Breakfast was included with my room. On the first morning, I asked if they had soya milk. They did not, but the woman I spoke with said they would have some for the rest of my stay. Each of the next two mornings, they did not have any. It wasn't a huge problem, but it did make me wonder if I had had a more pressing issue, how would it have been handled?\nThe hotel is well built. The building across the street was under construction, but the noise was not a disruption at all.\nI would definitely return!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:13:00.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
