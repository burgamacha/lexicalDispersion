We had monument tube station a 2 min walk away and we could walk to and from lovely restaurants, shops and tourist sites within 15 mins. Great when traveling with children, and felt like a safe area. The breakfast was really good as hotel breakfasts go, all you could eat for 10.00 and the children ate for free. The family room was great with a double bed a single bed and 1 camp bed. Room was very clean. Would highly recommend this hotel and its amazing friendly helpful staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:42:18.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
