If your looking for a friendly hotel in a terrific location on 7th avenue and are on a budget you can't go wrong with this hotel. With most hotels in New York the rooms are not massive unless your paying big bucks but the standard rooms have everything you could possibly want n need. Some small part could do with a little touch up but if they turned this hotel all modern im sure it would lose the friendly family feel this hotel gives. I would also highly recommend the park cafe restaurant in the hotel amazing food n service better than your ever get from the big themed bad food restaurants ie Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock etc etc. I'd like say thankyou so much to all involved at hotel for the great stay we had", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:47:33.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
