Needless to say it was a bit of a mood killer for being on holiday. However I was quite impressed with how the hotel dealt with the problems and all staff had great attitude throughout and when they couldn't fix the problem immediately they offered some small token of compensation. I do appreciate the letter from the guest service manager on our last night of stay which added a personal touch and made me feel that they have done the best of their ability to help.\nI gave 4 star because the bathroom in our second room had no exhaust fan (I'd know one if I see one as our first room had one). It had a window however does not help with venting out smell at all... it could a design flaw in certain rooms.\nOverall I'd definitely recommend this hotel to others. I'd probably ask to change the room if there's no fan in the bathroom next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:12:00.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
