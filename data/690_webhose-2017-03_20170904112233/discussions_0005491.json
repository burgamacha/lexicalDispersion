Check in after a long journey was smooth and effortless. Hotel staff seemed genuinely pleased to wecolme us the hotel and were quick to respond when we asked for more toiletries and towels. The room, not the biggest - but this is NYC. Inside, the style of the room was good. Nicely decorated with big comfy bed and decent shower room and toilet area. Also good to experience that the room was well insulated against noise of the city and noise from the corridor. On leaving, staff again we're helpful with checkout and storing our bags. The best thing though is the location. Perfect as a base to explore all this amazing city has to offer. Definitely recommended for a New York City break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:46:56.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
