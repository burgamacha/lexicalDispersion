It's like stepping back in time, spotlessly clean and quite historic. I can only imagine what this hotel was like back in 1902 when it was built.\nLocation was great, walk out of the hotel, turn right, straight onto 5th Ave, look left and see the Flat Iron building, walk right and see the entrance to the Empire State building.\nHotel staff were also great, especially when I had to call a Dr for my mother who was taken ill during the night. Would highly recommend this hotel and would also stay here again.\nRoom Tip: They cater for groups of 3, with 3 single beds See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:06:51.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
