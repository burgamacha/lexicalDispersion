Sanjay and Edgar were fabulous! We had been to Paris previously, but wanted to stay some place where we were close in proximity to everything - without having to walk so far to get places. We found it at Hotel de Buci. Everything is within feet from the front door, a block or two at the very most - pastry shops, wonderful dinner places, including many that are on the must-do lists of Travelocity! The Seine River was only a few blocks away, including Notre Dame; the Metro was also in close proximity. We could not have asked for a better location. We did not want to spend a lot on the room, so opted for the Boudoir Room, which was perfect for two people. While on the small size, it certainly falls in line with European room sizes. We were not spending a great deal of time in the room, so felt that this met every need. It even has a small mini fridge. A full bar in the lobby, including coffee, wines and liquors of every kind is also a nice touch. The hotel is quiet, and while our room did not have much of a view, it did not much matter because we were able to keep the windows wide opened at night for the evening fresh air and not hear a single car roll by or activity in the street. This is by far the best choice of hotel we could have ever made. Thank you again to everyone at Hotel de Buci for making this an unforgettable experience. Thank you also for the fabulous bottle of Champaign and macaroons! What a special surprise and a fabulous way you made us feel so welcomed at your hotel. We'll certainly be back !!!!\nRoom Tip: Super clean, quiet, fabulous hotel staff! Smallest, and least expensive room was on the small size...
