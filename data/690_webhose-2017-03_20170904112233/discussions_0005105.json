It was easy to access from the airport (steps from Vivan metro). Lots of restaurants and cafes for food and drinks, and it was a short metro ride (or 30+ minute walk) to the river, Notre Dame, etc.\nThe hotel staff were very kind, courteous, and friendly. The room was very clean and neat (although quite small...not much room to walk around). Our room on the second floor overlooked the street and was extremely quiet with the door closed, and a bit noisier with the door open. There was some construction going on the front face of the building, but it didn't affect us at all.\nOverall we had a very comfortable stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:29:49.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
