The location is great, with the Hays Galleria shops next door and plenty of decent riverside bars and restaurants nearby. On arrival we were made to feel valued guests and very welcome, The property has a modern feel to it, everything is spotlessly clean and the staff everywhere are incredibly proactively helpful and friendly. Nice Exec lounge with decent F&B offerings, nice Bar. OUr only regret was we only had one night, however already planning to rearrange a future trip to stay here instead of the place we currently have booked. Had a problem with the A/C in the room not working, but staff arrived within minutes of calling and offered a workaround of another room as they couldn't fix it until next day. Was also contacted by duty manager after the stay checking if I was happy. Simply excellent service all around. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:01:25.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
