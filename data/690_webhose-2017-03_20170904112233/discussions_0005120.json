I attended a conference last week and found it to be one of the best place for conferences / meetings in Kampala.\nThe place is huge however they offer electric golf carts to pick & drop participants from their rooms to the conference area, dining areas as well as to the venues where you may be attending an event in the evenings.\nThe rooms are of good standards and well maintained. The services are good.\nOverall the place is really huge and nice for anyone to have meetings & seminars as well as suitable place for individual travelers and families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:28:31.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
