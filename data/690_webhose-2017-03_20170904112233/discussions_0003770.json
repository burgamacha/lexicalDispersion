The location is great as its right next to Termini station where you can get buses or metro or trains, very ideal if you want to explore Rome. Although me personally i dont like public transport so we went round Rome by foot. Colloseum is approx 20 mins away and etc\nUpon arrival we were greeted by Emilio who was our concierge at that time of the day and he explained that we've been upgraded to the best room in the hotel and the very top floor with our own roof terrace balcony. He also gave us tourist map of Rome and circled all the best placed to visit and how right he was! Since we decided to walk to all those places, we've seen so much more than we've expected. When we got in the room, everything was clean and tidy as my expectations would be about a 4 star hotel. Also in the fridge there was complimentary mini bar which came in handy after daily travels! Bathroom was very modernised and shower was quiet spacious... In the morning we went to have breakfast and it was buffet style, there was bacon, some varieties of cheese and a waiter who would offer to make you italian style coffee.\nOverall we left Rome with nothing but big smiles on our faces and overall experience was beyond expectations!\nRoom Tip: room 501 is by far the best room in the hotel, recommend to everyone!
