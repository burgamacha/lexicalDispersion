The location is very close to the Eiffel Tower and public transport system. The food on the room service is very limited and it took them nearly 2 hours to get a cheese platter. The staff are very friendly and helpful, they also spoke English well. The bar is open 24 hours and the front desk is also 24 hours. The rooms arent very big but they are modern with an openening double door window which doesnt really have a balcony. We had a small view of the top of the Eiffel Tower which was nice I guess. The bathroom is small but manageable with a great shower. Has a fridge with a small amount of general drinks. There is a TV which is mostly French based shows but movies sometimes can be changed to English. The bed is really comfy with tables on both sides there is also a espresso pod style coffee machine. There is a grocery store directly across the road which is fun when everything is writtten in French but they had lots of stuff. Just about all places take Visa card too. Hope this helps, happy holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:07:18.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
