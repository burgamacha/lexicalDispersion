I had a very nice single room with a modern, well-stocked bathroom. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent, with a great and varied selection of items. Another nice feature is that there are complementary croissants, blood orange juice, and an espresso machine that the guests may enjoy throughout the day. However, the best aspect of this hotel was it's kind and helpful staff. These people who work at Hotel Raffaello are the nicest hotel staff that I have encountered and did their utmost to make my stay pleasant and I can't thank them enough for all that they did for me. I would definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: I have no suggestions but I did not encounter any street noise during my stay.
