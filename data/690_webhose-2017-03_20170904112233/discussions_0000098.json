We were early, so our bags were minded in a secure room.\nThe hotel is near to everything - Times Square and all the places you would expect to see. We used the Subway most of the time which took a little while to work out, but in the end we used it each day.\nThere was no kettle in the room which perplexed us at first. Just use the microwave to heat up cups of water. No problem.\nThere are fresh food markets nearby, so it's easy to find really good food to prepare for yourself if you want to.\nOne hint about the breakfast. It is buffet style. Get there EARLY! If not, you will have to queue and the floor gets very dirty and messy, but it is magically cleaned up by lunchtime. In the early evening there is happy hour, with half price drinks.\nAll in all a good place to stay.\nWe caught a cab to and from the Airport - my advice would be to do this because the New York cab drivers are very good and know their stuff!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a corner room - they are bigger See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:50:40.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
