I walk in the lobby at 5:30...first I am greeted at all..yes and very kindly...offered a glass of wine at check in..yes..free. Jacklyn checked me in. Her service was impeccable! Room was clean and the bed luscious. And... loved the touch of lavender oil they offer to help you relax. Towel quality was great and shower and bath high end regarding the shower and faucets. Keurig coffer. Service was excellent but restaurant service was slow...really slow but food was decent. Highly recommend it over the local Hiltons on service alone. I will be back!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:42:42.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
