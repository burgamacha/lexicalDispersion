The elevator is small to begin with and as you may have read, one elevator has been down for a while, so now there is ONLY one, even smaller, elevator.\nI actually had no issues with the elevators all weekend though.\nSo on to my review. I like this hotel a lot. The lobby smells great and I am not a fan of scents. The huge saltwater tank is beautiful and very relaxing to watch. And now i get to watch it a lot longer SINCE HE IS STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR. Now, I want one lol. The service is excellent- doormen, friendly maids. The doorman actually moved his car so we could have his on-street spot for the weekend which saved us $100. Rooms clean, decor very nice, beds excellent, especially the crispy ironed linens. Bathroom is small but who cares really. I'm in NYC for the weekend and that is the place i will spend the least amount of time! Location is excellent.\nI chose this place because I got an excellent price for this particular room layout, which seems hard to come by for a good price (less than $400). Two beds in a separate bedroom, and a very spacious living room, with little balcony i may add (no great view though), with a pull-out sofa. The \"kitchenette\" is very elegant actually.\nThe penthouse level bar is nice for a drink. I wasn't happy that after we got comfy on a sofa the hostess asked us to move so she could seat a party of 5 there. There was PLENTY of other places to put them. So, we left. F that. One of members of that party came after us and was mortified, offered to give up the spot and buy us drinks. That was sweet but I didn't want to stay there.\nDespite this and the elevator issue, I would stay here again, believe it or not. All the positives outweighed the negatives and were things that are easily remedied (fix elevator and slap, I mean educate, hostess).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:47:01.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
