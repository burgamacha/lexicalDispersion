Traveling with kids is already difficult, finding a hotel in NYC with separate sleeping and living areas and a kitchenette at an affordable rate made it so much easier. From the moment we pulled up we were greeted with a friendly attitude and it continued every moment of the trip. The location was amazing. First class hotel! Quiet but just a short walk to everything we needed. Booked again for the end of summer this time for 2 nights. Can't wait, see you soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:47:52.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
