Friendly staff, beautiful rooms furnished to a high standard. As our visit to Rome was for a special occasion we upgraded to a room with a hot tub and balcony, which was lovely and we felt priced reasonably Although the view is limited it was nice still nice to sit out there.\nBreakfast is next door with a good choice.\nIt fairly centrally located with a 10 min walk to the Coliseum, 15min to the Trevi Fountain and around 30-40 mins to the Vatican. It's easy to walk to all the sights, the streets are lovely and interesting and you miss so much of the city if you don't walk.. we wouldn't recommend the hop on hop off buses.. it's money you really don't need to spend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:11:15.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
