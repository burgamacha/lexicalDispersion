It is a building rich in ancient and modern history (many key figures of the beat generation stayed there when it was a lot cheaper). Rooms are elegantly decorated and display ancient wooden framing. They equipped with amenities (including well functioning wifi), and the bedding is heavenly comfortable. The manager -Monsieur Henry - goes out of his way to be hospitable (free tea room service after a cold day walking around the city is a nice touch). We go to Paris about once a year, and it was the second time we stayed at the hotel and we will definitely go back. It's an invaluable find!\nRoom Tip: top floor, possibly not facing street (less noise) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:04:39.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
