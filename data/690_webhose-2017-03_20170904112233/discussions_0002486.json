But we are happy with the room arrangements and the breakfast buffet. The airconditioning is working well too, tho you may want to bring your own toothbrushes if you don't like the hassle of having to call housekeeping. There are many outlets at convenient places around the room, just bring the right adaptors. Breakfast was something to look forward to especially the sausages and bacon. Their croissants are heavenly and the pudding just the right sweetness. They have dates and green grapes, which I love! Try the Kusmi Tea; you can brew a pot. We got a room \"with a view\" — the River Seine outside and the Eiffel Tower from a distance. The hotel staff are quite friendly and fluent in English. We are having a very pleasant stay. Some 15-minute walk away from the hotel, there is a huge mall, 4 Temps, which connects underground to Cnit mall. It is worth spending a few hours shopping there, the shops are more down-to-earth that the ones at Galleries La Fayette and Champs Elysees. You'll also love it's proximity to the Metro — Line 1 will take you to the Louvre, Champs Elysees and connect you to the Sacre Coeur at Chales de Gaule port. Taking a taxi is good but for the traffic. Take the Metro or RER, they're fast and frequent. I wish we had more time to enjoy Paris!\nRoom Tip: Ask for one with the view of the River Seine and the Eiffel See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:16:32.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
