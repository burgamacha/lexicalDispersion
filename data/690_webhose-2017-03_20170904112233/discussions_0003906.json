The trade-off for convenience is it’s on a busy street, and we had a lot of street noise in our room. The windows are remarkably effective at shutting out noise when closed. But if you’re used to sleeping with windows open for fresh air, as we are, you may find it difficult to sleep.\nThe Amalfi’s staff was wonderful – friendly, helpful and accommodating. In fact, after our first night, we asked to move from our second floor room to one on a higher floor hoping for less street noise. They suggested a room on the back of the hotel would be quieter, but we wanted to retain our view of the piazza so we chose a room on a higher floor. They moved us the next day, instructing us to simply leave our luggage in the room when we left for the day, and they transferred it to the new room where it was waiting when we returned in the evening. Unfortunately, moving higher didn’t reduce the noise, but the hotel staff accommodated our request without hesitation as soon as they could.\nRoom and bathroom were typical of other European hotel rooms we’ve had, that is, small. But there was enough storage for our clothes and multiple surfaces throughout the room that allowed us to “move in” and set up our stuff for our eight days there.\nBreakfast was good (with a lovely woman attendant making sure everyone had everything they needed, with great affection and attention). Hot food included scrambled eggs and sausages. There were also hardboiled eggs, yogurt, cheeses and cured meats; granola and other cereal; and multiple sweet pastries and plain breads. The selection didn’t vary during our week there, but there was enough variety to begin with.\nI could certainly recommend the Amalfi for its convenience to transportation and sites, staff, rooms and amenities. If you are sensitive to noise or a light sleeper, you might ask for a room at the back of the hotel.\nRoom Tip: Rooms on back of hotel are quieter.
