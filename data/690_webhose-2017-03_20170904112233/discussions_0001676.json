It is a lovely, clean and peaceful retreat. Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The pool is small but perfect for cooling off or relaxing around with a cold beer or milk shake. We stayed in one of the old rooms on our first stay. It was a bit small (for a couple) and dark but clean and comfortable. On our second stay we were given a room above the restaurant, this was light, airy and well furnished. Breakfast and meals are served at Cafe Mamba which is part of the hotel. There is a good range of choices.\nRoom Tip: If possible avoid rooms 301 - 306 they are a bit small for a couple and a bit dark.
