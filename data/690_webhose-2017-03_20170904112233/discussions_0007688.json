We very much enjoyed our stay. My two daughters (ages 9 and 11) and I used this as a home base as we toured around London and beyond. The staff (with the exception of one woman in reception) were exceedingly helpful and friendly. The English breakfast was ample and contained numerous vegetarian options. We had easy access to Heathrow, the Underground, and also did a lot of walking from our hotel to Kensington and Hyde Parks. We tried three different rooms and enjoyed best the Jr. Family Room on the first floor.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room on the ground floor or above. The rooms on the basement level were a little dark.
