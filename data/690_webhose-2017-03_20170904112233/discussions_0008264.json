The Z hotel was truly fabulous. On arrival, we had booked in early and received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a window - which was great. The room was very clean, had a large TV, toiletries and complimentary tea/coffee & water. Very impressed! Staff were very helpful and friendly. Had an issue with the shower temperature in the early hours of the morning and was quickly sorted out with in 2 minutes of reporting it.\nWill be staying again!
