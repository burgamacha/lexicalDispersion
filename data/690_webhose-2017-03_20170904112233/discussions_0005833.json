Got a early check in and late check out and staff was very attentive to all requests. Close to Luxembourg station so very easy to hit up all of Paris via metro. Very easy walk to st Michel, notre dame and many places to eat and drink on rue Danton, near the Sorbonne and rue st Germaine. Room is small but still has all one needs for comfort and a 10/10 bathroom with a powerful shower head. If traveling with a family, you might need to ask about the small number of suites or adjoining rooms that are available. Breakfast is available in the lobby but I chose to eat elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:03:26.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
