The lobby smells like heaven and is very elegantly designed. We upgraded to a junior suite (albeit for a price) and we were quite content with the room (larger than the typical European hotel room but smaller or on par with most US hotel rooms outside of NYC). The room had high ceilings (yay!), was well apportioned and clean. The bathroom was sufficiently large and comfortable. The bed is extremely comfortable, falling asleep was quite easy. I agree with other reviewers who have noted the less-than-clean carpet (we used the room slippers provided by the hotel). I was also happy to have a coffee machine in the room, I used it almost everyday. The pods are replenished daily.\nStaff members were pleasant and helpful. Moez especially went out of his way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable, which we greatly appreciated.\nOur cab drivers and tour guides all remarked on the central location of the hotel. Indeed, most sights and neighborhoods are no more than a 40-minute walk away (usually much less than that).\nAlthough it is a bit pricey, we found this hotel to be totally worth it, given our pleasant experience. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T20:25:55.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
