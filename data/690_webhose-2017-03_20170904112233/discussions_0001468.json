The location is absolutely perfect - a short walk from Notre Dame, the Seine and the St Michel metro/RER station. It's also situated in a lovely area which is great for wandering around, finding different places to eat and drink and soaking up the culture.\nThe staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and welcoming.\nWe booked a queen bed room with Eiffel Tower view and it was very spacious and comfortable. The tea supplied in the room is delicious! There was also a little balcony which we enjoyed thoroughly.\nMy only slightly negative feedback for the hotel manager is that the housekeeping was a bit hit-and-miss. For example, when we arrived, there was still a stack of discarded shopping bags leftover from the previous guest, the housekeeper took away the shower cap I was saving for a second use and didn't give me a new one, and one day we came back to the room at about 3.30pm and the room hadn't yet been serviced, so we had to go down to the bar while they cleaned it. However, these were only minor inconveniences and we still had a fantastic stay at this hotel.\nIf we return to Paris we certainly hope to stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:53:09.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
