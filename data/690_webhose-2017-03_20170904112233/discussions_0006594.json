Excellent service ;-)\nAlso the rooms are not very modern, but they are clean and fresh sheets.\nThe owner also recommended us with several pointers for our stay. So i can only recommend this hotel. If you are not that difficult on a bit outdated hotel, but you want to stay in a clean, and in the middle of everything in Paris, then you should stay here. There is no escalator; so if you are not that good with your legs, better to ask a room on the first floor :-) We were happy, and will return !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:58:27.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
