Location is good just up from Gloucester road tube station, lots of local restaurants/good bus routes, and pubs by the dozen well almost and close to various museums. We had an executive room which was nice, hotel quiet enough, staff efficient, and breakfast good but ensure its in your deal as paying on the day isn't cheap Â£19.95 for a full English. The bar is very small and closes early, and the drinks are expensive but given the hotels location in central London this is to be expected. A plus is free internet. Overall it's a good do, and we enjoyed it.\nRoom Tip: Get breakfast included in your deal See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:41:00.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
