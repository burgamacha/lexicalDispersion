What a mad house!!! We entered on the 41st St. side. Got checked in quickly and into our room. Had a fantastic view of the Empire State building colored green in honor of the day. Slept well on a wonderful bed in spite of hearing some of the city noise. It is New York City in Times Square after all. We were on the 37th floor. The noise was not a problem for us. The location can't be beat and the New York City half marathon race ran right by the front of the hotel. I was able to cheer my husband as he ran by. We were able to walk to wonderful pubs and restaurants in the theater district. The wonderful doormen got us taxis for all the places that were too far to walk. Check out was seamless and done quickly in our room. We would not hesitate to stay here for any future visits in New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:44:10.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
