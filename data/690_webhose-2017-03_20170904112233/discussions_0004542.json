The coffee machine was a real positive along with the selection of different coffees. Bathroom was spacious, compared to the bedroom and the shower was excellent with good water pressure.\nThe location was superb and it was a short walk to chops and plenty of attractions, with a fair selection of different eating options around.\nOverall I would recommend, although this isn't a cheap hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:30:45.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
