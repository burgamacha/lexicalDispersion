The staff at Hotel Relais were most helpful in accommodating us, even after it was discovered that we had made a few errors in our original booking. Thankfully, this was in November and not the height of summer.\nAs other reviewers have said, the hotel is in a great location, near a grocery, restaurants, metro stations and bus stops - a very nice base for seeing the city. The rooms were well laid out, with three of us on one room (with an extra bed) having no difficulties. Well maintained all around. Bathroom with double sink and shower/tub. Toilet separate. Slippers and robes were provided.\nBreakfast was quite good with plenty of seating. Wifi was good (available in room, not just lobby). There are also computer stations in the lobby seating area.\nThe hotel stored our bags while our rooms were readied which allowed us to make the most of our first day. Upon leaving, the staff arranged for transport to the airport. Very helpful and friendly staff. I'd stay here again when visiting Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:50:39.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
