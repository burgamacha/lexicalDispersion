Service is impeccable and they are truly happy to help you with anything you need. There were nightly gifts on our bed which was a wonderful touch welcoming us back from a long day being tourists. And as mentioned many times in posts the nightly Plunder the Pantry was a highlight of our day. Relaxing by the fire in a comfy chair reviewing our day with snacks and beverage of choice. Buckingham palace is right across the street and we were delighted one morning to see the horse and carriages come out for a little walk around. Also there's a pub across the street where we met locals who loved to chat and a little diner style eatery where we ate most mornings before heading to our next tourist destination. Victoria Station is 2 blocks away from Hotel 41 if you need the tube. The concierge helped us navigate until we became tube experts. The room was beautiful with everything you need to be comfortable and have a good nights sleep. Sometimes too comfortable where we slept the morning away. Dont miss out on Hotel 41!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:39:00.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
