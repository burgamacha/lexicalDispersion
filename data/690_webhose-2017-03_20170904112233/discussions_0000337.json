The service we experienced at The Goring is head and shoulders above any other hotel we've experienced. Always helpful, always caring, never cloying, we felt part of a great tradition of excellence. We have both said we can never stay anywhere other than The Goring when in London. It's very well located, the rooms are elegantly appointed, very comfortable and clean as a whistle. But it's the warmth that every staff member treats you with that puts this property head and shoulders above the rest. Highly, highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:59:38.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
