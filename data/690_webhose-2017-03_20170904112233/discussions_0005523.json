There are 2 different Metro lines within a couple of hundred yards. You can also walk to the Louvre and other landmarks in about 10 min. We had 2 rooms and both of them were to hot (about 90 deg). We turned down the heat all the way and they were still a little toasty so we opened the windows and that did the trick. Beds and pillows where acceptable and everything was clean. All the staff where very friendly and helpful including the cleaning staff. Also there was enough shopping to satisfy my wife and daughter within 200 yards of the hotel. All in all we were very satisfied with this hotel and would book here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:13:19.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
