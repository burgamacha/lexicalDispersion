I needed to find a place that is located near the Gare du Nord which is the north station because it offers the direct trains to the CDG international airport. This hotel was perfect bercause of its location and value. It is only about 300m from the main entrance of the station to the hotel. So it took only a few minute to walk there with luggage. Also, there was many subway or public transportation options near by.\nThe biggest surprise was the hotel seems to be newly renovated, the lobby, breakfast area and the rooms were very new or up kept well. The room I stayed in even had a Nespresso machine, two slices of chocolate, a bottled water, two bath robes and two pair of slippers.\nThe service was great because they were very polite, professional, efficient for checking in and out (which you don't see everywhere), and spoke fluent English.\nI think the value was very high because of the quality you get was much higher than other hotels offered near by.\nHowever, since I only stayed for one night, you can always check others for their review. I hope this was useful and hope your stay was an enjoyable as mine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:11:23.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
