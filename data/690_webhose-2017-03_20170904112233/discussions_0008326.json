Amazing gym with incredible facilities, massive pool and tennis and basketball courts. While I am normally on business, they also have an Adventure Zone for the kids. Huge plus for families.\nThe rooms are modern, well-appointed and the staff are incredibly attentive.\nI travel a ton, and so I am so impressed how they all seem to recognize frequent travelers from the Shangri la Golden Circle program. It is unreal how they do it.\nEvery time I arrive they have always made little adjustments based upon either a specific preference I expressed or even something the maid observed and fed into the system.\nCentro is a great bar always with real energy and great music.\nThe Horizon Club and the team working there are amazing. Highly recommend a stay at a club level room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:57:47.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
