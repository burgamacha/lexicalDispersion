Absolutely fantastic!! We were able to take a train from Heathrow to right near the Ibis and walk across the street. The room was small but that was expected as it is an Ibis. Made it a little difficult to have access to both suitcases but this was soon forgotten when we got into the bed. Really comfortable beds for a hotel so sleep was peaceful. We had to be organised in the morning as there is not a lot of room to get around each other as you are getting ready but again, this was soon forgotten, as the breakfast downstairs was really good. I am not a huge breaky person so the continental breakfast had enough variety to have me satisfied. My husband went for the full breakfast and he was able to fill up which kept us going for most of the day. A surprising variety on offer which was also of a high quality.\nAcross the road was a Salisbury supermarket which has a huge assortment of ready made dinner items available, so if we were exhausted after a day of exploring London, we just popped in for some takeaway and brought it up to our room.\nI could not recommend this hotel more highly.\nOur only gripes were that the room did not have a mini fridge and that there was no laundrette available. I did find a laundry to wash our clothing a 10 to 15 minute walk away. There are dry cleaning facilities available at the hotel but at a couple of pounds for underwear or one top each, it is too expensive for my liking.\nIf I was to come to London again, this would definitely be somewhere I come back to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:32:57.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
