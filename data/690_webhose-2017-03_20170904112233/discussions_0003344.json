Great location as a base to explore Paris. 10 min walk from Le Gare du Nord. The room was well presented, layout worked well but we didn't have much luggage. You may struggle here with larger cases. Towel and sheet changes during our stay and we were only in there 3 nights. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. I would definitely come back to this hotel. It was lovely, cosy and warm but with large windows you can open if it gets a little too warm. We really liked it here. Great value comfy & cosy hotel.\nDon't let the exterior fool you, they're having some building work done I think.\nTIP; if you stay here Holybelly is just down the street and does THE best breakfast to set you up for the day of exploring!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:49:12.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
