Chose hotel due to close proximity to Gare du Nord (Eurostar train station in Paris); Hotel Aida Marais is two Metro stops away. The Jacques Bonsergent Metro stop is one block away. The larger (more subway lines serving) République Metro stop is nearby as well in the Place de la République with many options for dining and shopping.\nService was impeccable at check-in. I had some problems with my reservation (my fault, not theirs). Olga worked tirelessly to help me fix the issues and let us check-in early so we could start touring the city without our luggage. All other hotel staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.\nThe property is clean and neat. Everything is compact, as can be expected of downtown city hotels, but well appointed. We had two rooms, one facing the front of the property (view from our window shown), the other on the rear of the property (view was of the backs of adjacent buildings, typical of what you'd expect - nothing glamorous). The rooms are small, but had great beds, terrific shower, hair dryer, and central heating and air conditioning.\nOur room rate included breakfast, which was ample and well served in the amazingly quaint and comfy lower level of the hotel.\nHotel Aida Marais was perfect for us with close proximity to Gare du Nord, Metro stops, affordable rate, breakfast and an authentic Parisian experience.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:59:16.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
