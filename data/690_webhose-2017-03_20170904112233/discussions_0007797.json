This was the perfect base for our stay. It is a couple of minutes walk to the London Eye and Westminster Bridge. The closest tube station is Waterloo, however, we used Westminster Bridge as it was about the same distance and we enjoyed the walk over the bridge and walking past Big Bed and the Houses of Parliament. We arrived at the hotel very early, approx 9 am, and went straight to the hotel and left our bags there in a secure room which let us head off to begin sightseeing. Check in was quick and easy and there never were too many people queuing. The room was spotless and the beds were very comfortable and as a bonus we had a super view of The Shard building in the Financial District. The room was equipped with air conditioning but I don't think it was working, we didn't complain about this as we spent so little time in the room. We will definitely be returning to London and to the Premier Inn, Waterloo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:58:22.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
