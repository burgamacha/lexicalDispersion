My room this time was larger, and overlooked a courtyard. I thought it was charming.\nI slept very well here too.\nThere is something lovely about this hotel...the location, the layout of the rooms, the overall ambience, I can't specify what. The food tastes great here too!\nIt's in a fantastic location too, so close to the centre of Ancient Rome.
