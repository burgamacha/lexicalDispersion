It was laid out very nicely and the grounds are kept very neat. They give you a map of the property so you can see what there is and where it is. I received a complimentary glass of wine upon check in. My room was located on the 2nd floor and was very quiet. It was pretty large and had a working fireplace, I did not use it while there, a ceiling fan which I did use. I ate both the complimentary breakfast they provided one morning and enjoyed the to go breakfast they provided the day I had to leave before the breakfast was served. I also ate dinner on the property and it was great (I had steak). I went for a quick dip in the small plunge pool located behind my room, it was freezing cold, but very close to my room. I did not purchase anything from the gift shop but they had nice things for sale.\nRoom Tip: I stayed on the second floor and found it very quiet See more room tips See all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:36:47.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
