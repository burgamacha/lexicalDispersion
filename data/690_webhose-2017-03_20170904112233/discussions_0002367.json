It's a beautiful historic hotel, with a midtown location that makes it convenient to the theatre district. We received great service from a very professional staff, and really enjoyed our stylish room and extremely comfy bed. I would also like to mention their Library just off the lobby--a coffee and tea room with books and newspapers of their guests.
