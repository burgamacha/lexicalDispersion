It's small and cozy, and everyone in the hotel is nice - from the front desk and concierge to the housekeeping. It has some \"old world charm\" feel to it, and they give you free coffee and newspapers in the small library. This time we got there so late that I guess they were out of regular rooms, so we got upgraded to a remarkably large suite: bigger than my 1-bedroom apartment when I lived in NY! The elevators can be a little slow but nothing that ever bothered me. I've never had any trouble with noise from other rooms. It's a great location for proximity to Broadway shows. We like to walk so we even walked to Lincoln Center, which took about 20-25 minutes. It's not fancy (except for my suite!) but it's my go-to place when I'm traveling to NY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:11:48.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
