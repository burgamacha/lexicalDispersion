If you're looking for a simple but clean & central hotel then this is the place to go to.\nYou are only a 20 min leisurely stroll from the Arc de Triomphe and Des Champs Eleysess, with a choice of 2 bus stops both only 2 mins from the hotel if you don't fancy the walk which only costs €2!\nThe staff are ever so friendly and offered us advise on the best ways to get to and from all the sites. We never experienced breakfast in the hotel as there were plenty of lovely little cafes offering breakfast nearby (Would recommend the breakfast/brunch cafe at the top of the street opposite the Arc De Triomphe!) however we did use the bar area for a drink one night and it was very pleasant.\nThe metro is also only a short distance away from the hotel however we chose to walk from place to place the majority of the time, only using the bus to get to the Eiffel Tower area which was around 10 mins.\nYou're also within easy access to Disneyland as you can get the train directly from the closest station and it only takes around 40 mins.\nThe only thing we weren't too happy about was when we were leaving, we asked the receptionist to phone us a taxi to the hotel for the airport and they failed to tell us there was an additional cost added in for them calling for us! If we had known this we would've picked one up or called ourselves.\nOther than that we had no complaints and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We would definitely return to stay here if we were to return to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:24:16.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
