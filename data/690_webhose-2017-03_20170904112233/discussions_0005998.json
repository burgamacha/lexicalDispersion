The Towers are gorgeous as is the hotel. We were greeted with champagne upon check in. The staff was so courteous. Papa our bellman was the best! The room for NYC standards is a great size. Comfy pillows and bed. A lot of space to get comfortable. Milton brown toiletries were a big surprise. While no coffee pot in room all you have to do is walk downstairs to this French cafe attached to the restaurant and your coffee is ready for pick up. Proximity to shopping can't be beat. Ease of leaving your car at valet was a breeze. This is my new favorite hotel in NYC. Fresco restaurant by Scotto is right around the corner. Hotel had a car that can take guests a short ride away but this must be done through the hotel in advance. There are great NY deli's all around so if you want a great NY bagel walk two blocks to the deli on Madison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:21:58.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
