Its an oddly set out building, with one set of lifts only accessible by walking through the restaurant - must be very distracting for diners? The rooms are all modern and quiet, despite the airport on one side, and DLR on another. Oh and nice toiletries in the bathroom, Crabtree and Evelyn!\nThe first time I ate in the bar, extremely average, had to send my steak baguette back as it was still part frozen - was told I had to have it well done in order to guarantee it was hot Second time went to the Fox, very near by, Much cheaper, not high dining but reasonable pub food, I even went back for breakfast the next morning as it was so reasonable.\nThere are a few free car parking spaces, but the paid for parking is actually free from 5.30pm till 9,30am - worth knowing if you're staying in local hotels where they charge Â£15 or more per night.\nDefinitely worth staying, warm cookie on arrival and a small well equipped gym - on my own most of the time I was in it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:15:34.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
