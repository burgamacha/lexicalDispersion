I expected an isolated and economy destination and couldn't have been more wrong! Just steps from the Rector St subway station, this is a great spot with easy access to the rest of the city and even LIRR and PATH trains. My room was a nice surprise too- not at all cramped and very functional- everything you need, nothing you don't (well, I didn't need the safe but it was tucked in the closet and could be handy for some). My room was clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. There was very little noise from other guests- just once I heard the people in the room next to mine leaving. From my 40th floor room I could see the Hudson River and lights in NJ at night. My window opened to let fresh air in and climate control worked well too. The guest laundry is coin operated and very clean, exercise room has more than one treadmill, there are three swiftly moving elevators and a restaurant on premises serves 3 meals daily. Staff were friendly and helpful. The elevators require your room key to select any floor but ground, a nice safety feature. Trinity Church is right down the block, as is the NY Stock Exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:29:27.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
