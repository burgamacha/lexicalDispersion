It was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. We decided to share as we intended to spend as much time roaming the city as possible. We only dined one morning, the breakfast buffet was lovely with a great selection of food. It was quite pricey hence our decision to find local cafe's. Drinks were reasonably prices for New York. The staff were incredibly friendly and suggested restaurants and bars off the beaten track. All in all, this little boutique hotel hit the spot, value for money.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:32:59.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
