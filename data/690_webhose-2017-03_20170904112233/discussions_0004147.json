There are plenty of common areas to sit and relax and our room was spacious and well appointed. There is plenty of choice for breakfast in the morning, both Chinese and western.\nThe location in the Hutong district allows you to explore the area which has not been developed with modern buildings, it feels like a real part of the old city. Despite initial reservations the area is very safe day and night and 20 minutes walk from a good selection of restaurants.\nThe Hutong is a fascinating area and can be explored on foot from the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:16:03.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
