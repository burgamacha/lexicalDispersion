Hotel claimed to not have my reservation upon arrival. I prepaid for early checkin and one night stay. In addition, my driver delivered my luggage to the hotel and confirmed my checkin. The front desk claimed to have no rooms then they said I wasnt clear about my arrival so they gave my room away. So I asked them what hotel guest pays for early checkin, has their luggage delivered, confirms their arrival and you don't expect their arrival. I got no response to this statement of fact.\nThe front desk person then rambled and said they didn't have my luggage. I had to demand the luggage four times and then they brought it. This whole experience was awful. I don't usually stay at this hotel in Paris and will never bother with it or Hyatt again. They were rude and kept repeating lies to explain why they would not honor a confirmed reservation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:40:17.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
