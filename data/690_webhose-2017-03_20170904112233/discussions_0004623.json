Off the main St Germain boulevard so it was not noisy. Only a couple of minutes away from Odeon Metro with Mabillion and St Germaine de Pres Metro a little further. Famous patisseries and boulangeries (Pierre Herme, Eric Kayser, Poilane), restaurants and shopping (similar to Champs Elysees and Rue St Honore, but more boutiques and CityPharma) within walking distance. Bus 86 easily brings you to the Le Marais/Bastille area across the Seine. Deluxe Room was comfortable for 4 adults (large room on ground floor). Christophe at the reception was very helpful and accommodating, helping us make reservations. Will definitely recommend and stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:44:26.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
