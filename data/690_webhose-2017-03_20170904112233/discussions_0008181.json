This was our first stay here; we wanted to explore a different area. Located on the pentonville road in vibrant Islington in north east London. Easily accessible by bus and tube but a nice 1.5 mile walk into central London. The hotel is clean and pleasant enough. The staff were reasonably welcoming at check in. We had booked an executive room. I emailed the hotel in advance to ask them for a nice quiet room with a view as it was our 28th anniversary . We are Hilton gold. We got a standard executive room which was quiet but with no view. No welcome letter or recognition of being gold or of our anniversary which was disappointing. The executive lounge was ok . Pretty rough red and white wine and one lager beer 6 to 8 and some canap√©s. The bags of crisps were welcome.\nSlept well , showers ok , just about hot enough. Preordered items not in room and had to be asked for. Telephone repaired promptly. Dressing gown and slippers had to be asked for but arrived promptly.\nBreakfast was good in the main area, we tried the executive lounge but they seem to have run out of everything so gave up.\nIt was in summary fine , we just did not feel particularly welcomed or cared about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:32:23.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
