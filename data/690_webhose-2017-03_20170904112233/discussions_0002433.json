Next at the front desk we met Mena, one word to describe him -- Fabulous! He took great care of us and even recommended a different room to upgrade to and we are so thrilled to have taken his suggestion. We order in for dinner and we met Melissa -- seriously? Is this place wonderful? The people fantastic? YES YES YES, Melissa the second night even brought us a card and goodies to eat (just on her own) because we would be running the the NYC Half marathon, it left us speechless. We haven't even begun to tell you about our accommodations -- our room was great, so comfortable and that we didn't want to even go out, we just enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt. We can't wait to come back. But to everyone who helped us, Regina was attentive, DeVon was our superman with a super smile, Denise had a great smile and warmth, Mena we already told you he was fabulous and Melissa is above and beyond...thank you!!!\nRoom Tip: We loved our room 2112 See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:20:35.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
