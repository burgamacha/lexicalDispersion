Despite lateness, we managed to get an excellent deal via a price saving site.\nIt's extremely well located, very central and next to a metro station - even within a stroll of some of the main sights and pleasant areas.\nThe rooms are basic and not large, but I rate 4 stars as it was clean, friendly and served its purpose. Ultimately, we just wanted a safe, centrally located and clean room to sleep in and this more than provides that.\nWe were in an inwards facing room (there's a central courtyard), so we can't comment on the noise which probably would not have bothered us even if present. Ultimately the aim was to be in the city, not the countryside, and the location is excellent as mentioned.\nThe lift was broken for our visit, and this meant 6 flights of stairs up a very narrow spiral staircase. No problem for us as we are young and mobile, but I can imagine this might have posed a problem for less mobile travellers. No doubt that issue is fixed now.\nRecommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:50:19.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
