I HAVE to say, when you're greeted with such physical beauty on the door and at reception, you want to hate them and assume a vacuous space behind such aesthetics, however, the reality was something else, completely delightful, helpful, professional, welcoming and frankly all round excellence. That's the bonus of this hotel, the beauty isn't skin deep it goes right through every aspect of the experience. A stunning afternoon tea, a gorgeous garden room, a delicious evening meal plus cocktails and a little birthday cake on the house delivered to our room. Thank you extremely beautiful people for the equally beautiful stay!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:26:38.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
