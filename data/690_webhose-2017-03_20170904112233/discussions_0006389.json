We stayed in the deluxe double and it was great. I've stayed in many NYC hotels and this one was definitely one of the largest eliminating my usual NYC claustrophobia. The room was also very clean and I did appreciate the modern touches and indulgent toiletries in the bathroom.\nI would've preferred a deeper bathtub but considering really can't complain too much.\nBut above else- what takes this from four stars to five is the amazing staff- I mean top notch customer service. They provided prosecco for me and my 3 friends when we checked in and they accommodated any question/comment we posed to the front desk. Stellar.\nProbably goes without saying, but yes, of course, I would stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:11:05.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
