Staff were informative and welcoming on all occasions that we dealt with them - checkin, daily on way in/out of hotel and checkout. Breakfast buffet was delicious and a nice perk if included - I'm not sure I would pay 16 Euros per person but if possible, find a room package with the breakfast included. Jr. Suite was well appointed and comfortable with ample storage space, small mini-bar, safe and coffee maker along with 2 flat screen TV's. The only programming available was in French but a USB stick was able to be plugged into the TV with pre-loaded movies from home. We were very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the Latin Quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:37:49.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
