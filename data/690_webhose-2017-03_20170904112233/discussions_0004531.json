Its location is just perfect, everything you can think of is within a short walking distance, plus it situated in the exciting Soho. The rooms are cozy, pleasant, clean comfortable and well maintained. But what tops it all is the hotel staff!! Starting with magnificent Alberto as well as the rest of the team made the whole difference to our vacation. They were always there for us, attentive, thoughtful, eager to assist and please, proactive and resourceful. This is what service is all about. I definitely will return to the Nadler on my next trip to town, and I highly recommend this experience to everyone I know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:12:11.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
