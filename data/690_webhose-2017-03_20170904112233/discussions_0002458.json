I´m used to high level 5* hotels, and must confess that the Rosewood is among the best ones where I ever stayed, what was really good, because after a very bad day, where I spent lots of hours at the airport waiting to leave on a flight which was finally cancelled, the Rosewood meant for me a great place to rest, relax and recover my energy for the next day.\nGorgeous room, big, spacious, spotless clean, well equipped, great room service, great bed and very good sleep quality, good located, a very good luxury hotel.\nI´m based in London, but berfore moving, I stayed several times at the Rosewood in London, which is great, but the one in Beijing is even better. Special mention to the staff and to the fact that one of the guys at the reception/front desk was a relocated staff from their London property....what means a perfect english speaker, what sometimes is hard to find in China. This is a very well thought detail which makes communication much easier. Well done to the hotel\nAs can be seen due to location considerations, the China World Summit Wing has been my preferred option in Beijing, but after having stayed at the Rosewood, I might change my view and start staying here in the future.\nAll in all, a fantastic experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:59:28.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
