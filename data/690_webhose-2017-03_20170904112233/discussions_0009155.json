It was approximately 8-10 minutes walk from Tower Hill underground station but very easy to find. The family room was huge and all the beds were very comfortable. Premier Inn's sleep guarantee lived up to its name - it was quiet all night!\nThe breakfast was large - mine wasn't hugely hot and the veggie sausages that had to be ordered were not the best I've ever had - but there was plenty of choice from both the cooked and buffet menu and the Costa coffee was great! I'd definitely recommend this for a family looking for a warm, comfortable and safe stay at a good price and in a convenient location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:04:37.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
