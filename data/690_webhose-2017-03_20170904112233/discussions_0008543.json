It was a comfortable, and quiet room with view to a park. The room was very clean (the same for the bathroom) with new furniture and flat tv with big variety of channels. Breakfast was more than ok and all the staff very polite. Also there was free luggage keeping in a secure room. Next time we visit London we will definitely stay at Phoenix Hotel as it is very central and so close to Metro and bus station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:00:06.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
