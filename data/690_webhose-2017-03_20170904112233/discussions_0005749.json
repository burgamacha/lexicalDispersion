I looked up a few places online that are near my office to make tomorrow's commute as easy as possible. Most had pretty good reviews, but I saw Staybridge online and it had nice reviews and I saw that it had a full kitchenette in every suite. I figured, if I can't stay in my own apartment, I might as well stay in something that's similar to an apartment. I called an Uber and was dropped off just 7 minutes away from my place. I was greeted by two lovely ladies, Miriam and Melissa, who made my check-in process as easy as 1-2-3. They asked me what brought me in so late, and I shared my situation with them. They showed true concern and compassion and were kind enough to give me a mini bottle of Prosecco and some snacks to make me feel better. A job well-done on their part. I'm happy I chose this hotel out of the hundreds that are in this area! Thank you very much, Staybridge, Miriam and Melissa. I look forward to the complimentary breakfast that comes along with my reservation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:46:11.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
