It is in a very quiet location with a small shop directly across the street. It is about 15 minutes walk from the London Bridge station. The room was clean and the front desk and restaurant staff were very nice and helpful. It is the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of the action while not actually being in the middle of the action. We highly recommend and would stay there again in a heartbeat!\nRoom Tip: Room 308 has a perfect view of the Shard, the tallest building in Europe.
