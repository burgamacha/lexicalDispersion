The staff were very welcoming and put a box of macaroons in my room to wish me happy birthday. We chose this hotel as we had been told this was a nice area to stay in . I have to agree at night it is not at all scary and it's not busy .the Eiffel Tower is literally 3 mins away and if you want a room with a view of the tower it will cost you a bit more but definitely worth it . I loved laying in bed watching the tower twinkle at night .\nThe room itself is small but that was to be expected, my only moan is there is no dressing table so standing up in bathroom mirror to do make up ect . The tea and coffee machine is a nightmare. They have an nespresso machine which is a pain to use a plain old kettle would have been better. The hotel is on par with premier inn only premier inn rooms are slightly bigger . But very clean so no complaints there.\nBreakfast is vast plenty to choose from . Everything from continental pastries to cheese , cold meats , fresh fruit ,cereal , yogurts or pancakes ,eggs ,bacon and sausages. What more could you want.\nWe really enjoyed our stay my only wish would be the barman was more chatty , after a night out you go to the bar for a night cap and each time we found the barman would do anything but engage in conversation with people. Shame really because we would have felt more welcome and stayed longer and spent more money in the bar perhaps a younger man is needed, just a suggestion.\nAs for the location it is perfect you have metro just around the corner and a. Try the rer train down to notra damn we found this train better than the metro and if your out late most cabs know this hotel so easy to explain where to go .\nIf using trains get a travel card for 3 days ect that cover your whole stay avalible from most ticket offices , it means you can use bus train , metro as much as you like instead of keep buying individual tickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:44:30.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
