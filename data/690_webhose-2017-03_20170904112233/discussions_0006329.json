It's in a great location, within walking distance to Times Square, Grand Central Station, etc. I hadn't been to New York in 15 years and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The room itself was super clean, the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and we both immediately made ourselves at home there!\nThe best part though, was checking in with Dave! We arrived super early at 7 AM, and we knew check-in was at 4 PM. We just stopped by to drop off our bags and begin our day. Dave told us all about the candy hour and wine and cheese hour later in the afternoon, and invited us to head up to the lounge where breakfast was starting. He stopped by about 5 minutes later with the best news of the day - he was actually able to get us into a room at 7 AM and had already arranged to have our bags brought up there! We were able to grab a quick nap before seeing New York for St. Patty's Day weekend! I don't think we could have enjoyed our trip as much as we did if Dave hadn't been able to work his magic!\nEveryone at the hotel was incredibly friendly and helpful, the wine and cheese hour is great and I definitely recommend stopping by, and the hotel and rooms are beautiful, modern, clean, comfy, and stocked with just about all you need! Thanks for a great trip!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:06:17.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
