When we needed a rest there were plenty of TV channels to choose from. Only complaint I would have regarding the hotel was the heating was always on. I opened the window slightly so the room stayed a nice temperature but it didn't help with the noise from outside.\nOther than this the staff were very pleasant and the hotel is a 3 minute walk from times Square. Considering we were hardly in the room this was perfect for us. If we were to come back we would use this hotel again. It gave us what we needed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:07:22.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
