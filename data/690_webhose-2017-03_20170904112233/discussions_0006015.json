It was a really beautiful room, in fact a suite really - bedroom,small lounge with sofa and tv and lovely bathroom. Also balcony facing the sea. We ate in the restaurant both nights and the food was wonderful. The staff were all so helpful. Enjoyed the pool too. Definitely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.\nRoom Tip: We asked for sea view which was on the first floor. Probably better than ground floor in my opinion See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:50:13.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
