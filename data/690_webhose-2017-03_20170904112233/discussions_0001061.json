We had a fantastic stay. The staff all over the hotel do not leave a stone unturned. On our arrival we were taken to our room by Florian (guest relations manager), we walked in and we're delighted to find the hotel had supplied a bottle of champagne and a cake, which was a really nice start to our stay. Anne on reception is fantastic. What she doesn't know about the shops, restaurants, tours etc in Paris isn't worth knowing. She gives really good advice and excellent directions to wherever you need. The gym and spa are really good and Camelia restaurant is nice. We had the tasting menu. The outside cocktail bar is really nice to start your night out, or if you want to stay in the hotel and relax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:08:37.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
