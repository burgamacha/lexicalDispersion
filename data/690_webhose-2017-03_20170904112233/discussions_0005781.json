Small rooms (as always in Paris) but well-kept and clean. Not noisy as it tends to happen in Paris. Location is optimal as it is close both to the business and tourist districts. The Staff was exceptional; the gentleman at the reception looked for a breakfast venue where they had gluten free even though I didn't ask any help. Price is super reasonable for the area. I did not have breakfast so I can't relate on that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:42:12.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
