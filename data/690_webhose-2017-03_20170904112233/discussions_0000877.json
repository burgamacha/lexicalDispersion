The rooms were nice, but beds were extremely hard! One of the foldaway beds in our 2 rooms was broken, but this was rectified quickly upon notifying housekeeping. It was difficult to communicate with reception staff as they spoke very little English, but a number of the restaurant staff spoke excellent English. The buffet breakfast was very nice, with a lot of variety.
