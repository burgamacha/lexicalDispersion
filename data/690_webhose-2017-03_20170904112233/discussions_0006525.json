Staying right by the Eiffel tower in this hotel has some obvious advantages, like you cant get lost just look for the giant tower, easy access to the hop-on hop off bus stops right in front of the tower, Bir-hakeim subway stop is 1 block away, The \"Le Bus Direct\" which takes you back to either ORY or CDG airport is 18 euro and 1 block away next to the Pullman (don't waste the money on a taxi back to the airport its 55 euro) , nice views of the tower , and close to the river.\nI would recommend this hotel for these reasons above.\nSome quick comments on the hotel.\n1. The staff at the front desk was very nice and spoke english very well. They can help you with tickets to the Disney, subway advice, buses etc. We did not use the hotel to book any of these items i felt like i found better offers on the Disney website and directly with the bus services.\n2. Get the breakfast included. Its a steal for the money (I think 19 euro per day). Theres a good variety and its a super quick way to start the day with a full stomach. Breakfast starts at 630AM, So if u have a real early flight in the morning you will need other options.\n3. Transportation is everywhere around the hotel. Taxis, subways and buses all within a stones throw.\nI have one complaint i think the hotel should address in a serious manner and thats checkin time. Its posted on the hotel website as 1400 daily. People who come to your hotel have travelled most likely all day to get there. They want to check in not sit and wait after 2pm like we had to until 220ish. Seems like a 1st world problem, but can sour the 1st impression.\nTo end on a positive:\nDefinitely want to thank Bruno at the concierge, he was super nice and funny.\nSincerely\nNB\nRoom Tip: Doesn't really matter See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:37:24.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
