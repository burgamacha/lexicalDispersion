This Classics Hotel was great. Parking underground, easy access with the car and the metro stop Mairie d'Issy was just around the corner. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. But the best was how easy it was to get into the heart of the city. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The room was very nice and the special \"happy time\" was a pleasant surprise. I have no complaints whatsoever and look forward to another visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:38:35.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
