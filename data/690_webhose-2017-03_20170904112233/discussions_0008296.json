Hotel is first class in style and comfort, if maybe lacking public space and extensive leisure facilities. Staff were noticeably impressive - not mechanical as I've experienced in many similar style hotels in London - always helpful and willing to assist. The reception foyer is small and leads straight into the bar area and through to Jamie's Restaurant at the rear. Bedroom had all I would expect in a top Hilton and provided me with a really great night's sleep. A room here is as expensive as you'd expect but taken as a whole I'd definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:02:37.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
