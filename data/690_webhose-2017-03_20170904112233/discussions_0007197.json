It is diagonally across the bus terminal if you are taking a bus shuttle to the Woodsbury premium outlet. It is very close to Time Square, H&M, Shake Shack and the Broadway theatres.\nThe rooms are quite spacious and came with complimentary Starbucks coffee packs. Wifi was strong too - remember to sign up for your free SPG account to get free wifi.\nAs I stayed during St Patrick's day there was some merry making and music at the Irish pubs downstairs but it didn't bother me. We had dinner at the Foundry and the food quality was good.\nIt was a good stay and I hope to be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:38:58.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
