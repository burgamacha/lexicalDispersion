Check in was fast, efficient. Room was a typical Westin. Although I did have a great view of a roof (339) I was not there for sight seeing. Very good toiletries, Tea tree everything. The lounge though,,,was fantastic. Food was a little pricey, but good. Bartender took the time to know my name. If I could make one suggestion? The little creamers for the coffee (x2) was not sufficient, but the front desk was very helpful in locating a few more. I would stay here again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:36:47.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
