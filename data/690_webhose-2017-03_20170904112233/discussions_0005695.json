The location is actually prime; one block away from the Freedom Tower and 9/11 Memorial Museum, and one block away from the subway station (Rector Street) which will take you right into the heart of the action. From the hotel, I found it very easy to access Times Square, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. I was a little apprehensive about staying in FiDi, but it worked out great.\nCheck-in was very cheerful. I read a lot of complains about \"waiting 15 minutes for the elevator\" but have no idea what people are complaining about. It is a 50-story building with high-speed elevators. With almost 500 rooms, it can be busy, but at most you are waiting two minutes.\nMy room was a King View room on the corner of the 46th floor. Overlooking the Hudson and 9/11 memorial, the view was stunning. I would recommend spending a couple extra dollars and upgrading to a room with a view. There are also some people complaining about the rooms being small, which I find odd. The rooms are actually quite large for NYC. They were well-designed, with new furnishings, a comfortable mattress and fantastic shower.\nWifi was very reliable and easy to sign on. All staff I encountered were friendly and happy to help. Room service was also pretty good.\nI can admittedly be a bit of a hotel snob, and the Holiday Inn FiDi really hit everything well. When returning to Manhattan, I will be staying here again. Thank you for a great stay!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:23:23.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
