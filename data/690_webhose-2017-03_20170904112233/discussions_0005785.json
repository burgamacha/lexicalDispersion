We had a superior room which was very small. But on the plus side the bathroom was large with a window opening over the back but let lots of light in. There was a little noise from the road though we were on the 4th floor. Room was in the middle of being refurbished. Shame they had not finished. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Though we never partook there was wine and cold meats laid in for guests. And the coffee machine in the lobby is a nice bonus. Could do with a little more in the rooms though. On the hole I would recommend. Thanks for the nice stay", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:38:24.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
