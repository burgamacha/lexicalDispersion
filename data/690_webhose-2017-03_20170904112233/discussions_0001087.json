Check in was fast and easy. The 1st room we were given was on the 2nd floor facing the park, the ceilings were about 15ft high and it had tall beautiful french doors leading out to a small Juliet balcony. The only problem is we couldn't see much over the trees because we were too low. We requested another room (since we were paying for the view) and they accommodated us by moving us to a room on the top floor facing the park, Eiffel tower, and Louvre.\nThis hotel was very nice and we were also able to walk to many attractions, dining, and shopping from it.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with an Eiffel tower view See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:17:47.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
