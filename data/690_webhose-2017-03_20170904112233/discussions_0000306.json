It is superbly clean from top to bottom. The mini bar is stocked daily which is free of charge. The breakfast is excellent and entertained every morning with different delights inc homemade cakes and bread.\nIt is well located being 10 mins walk to the fountains. The tour bus is just up the road which you can hop on and off.\nI would say this hotel is more of a 5* than a 4. We only booked it after reading the comments on here and it certainly lived up to its reviews\nThank you for making our break so special", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:24:42.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
