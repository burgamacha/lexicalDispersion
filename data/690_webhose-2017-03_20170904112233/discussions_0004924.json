The staff at front desk are very helpful, check in & check out were very smooth, they have a nice facility to keep your luggage safe on check out. The room service was super quick considering the size of the hotel. The rooftop bar is worth visiting at night, super relaxing with nice view. The location is perfect, main time square is just 200meters away, central park is at just 15minutes walking distance.\nI would love to stay here for all my future business & family visits at NYC.\nPlease keep up the high standards of Hyatt\nRoom Tip: Ask for a higher floor for a good view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:16:11.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
