I wouldn't recommend for families, but as a solo traveller or as a couple I would highly recommend, large glass windows mean bright rooms, room was spotlessly clean, housekeepers are a real credit to this hotel! Bed was comfy, Tv was large, bathroom was en-suite shower, found the sink being in the main room a little odd but quirky nonetheless. All staff encountered were lovely and helpful. Brilliant room and very good location, would definitely consider staying again. For the price we paid no other hotel could compare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:00:34.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
