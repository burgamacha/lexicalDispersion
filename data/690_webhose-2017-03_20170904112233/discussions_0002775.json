The rooms are very large (enormous in NY standards), specially the Skyline Suites I usually stay. Great value for the money. Nice views, kitchen, living room, comfortable beds and very clean. The staff is also very helpful (special mentions to Juber at the door and Betsy at the front desk). I will most certainly return once again. Did I mention location? Love it.\nRoom Tip: I like the Skyline Suites.
