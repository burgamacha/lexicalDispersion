From the moment we arrived until our departure, we were treated like homeowners returning to our Manhattan apartment - they went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:31:29.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
