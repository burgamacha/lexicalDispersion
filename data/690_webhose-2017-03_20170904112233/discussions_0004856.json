Tiny room, theater district. And I'm a New Yorker, so there's no magic to me about the location. This place is flat out great. The room is designed so that every space, every item, is useful. And well-designed. And fun. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and the full wall window makes the whole room feel expansive. The desk/sink unit has everything you need, designed in a super efficient way. Fabulous shower, smart closets. They have an ironing room on the 2nd floor, so that every room doesn't need space for an ironing board. Safe is built into the floor of the closet--so space efficient. Great rooftop bar, really friendly staff. Free coffee in the morning. We are sold on this place. Will recommend to all out-of-town visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:12:15.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
