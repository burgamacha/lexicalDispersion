Although we only live a little over an hour away, this was our first overnight stay in NYC. I came across a special on the Internet for a discounted room, which was $158 including taxes. We were pleasantly greeted and told that we had been upgraded to a king suite! Such a nice surprise. The rooms were gorgeous. We had a huge bedroom with king size bed and a sitting room, 2 flat screen tvs ,small bar with mini fridge, mini bar and microwave. The prices in the mini bar were very reasonable. The bathroom had a soaking tub and lovely vintage looking fixtures. Everything was spotless. Our room looked out over the street. Noisy at times, but expected in NYC. Location was about 5 blocks to Times Sq. Subway was 1/2 block up street and restaurants were everywhere. Parking garage was right next door and was discounted for hotel guests. It cost us less than $40 to park for 24 hours, a very good price for that location. Breakfast was served at the Black Tap, the small restaurant next door with access from the lobby, noted for its huge and crazy milkshakes and designer bugers. The front desk can get you a reservation within 2 hours if you are staying at the hotel. A must do, when you see the huge lines going on for hours out the door with people we waiting to get in . Continental breakfast was included with our stay and had yogurt with toppings, fruit and about 10 different breakfast pastry, bagels, muffins etc., coffee, tea and juice. We had a wonderful stay and told everyone we know about The Blakely. We will definitely stay again. A top of the line NY experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:10:41.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
