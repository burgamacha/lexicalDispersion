It was so easy just walking from the station into the hotel and we were met with a warm welcome.\nEveryone at the Hotel was friendly, charming and couldn't do enough for us. We had a very spacious comfortable room.\nBreakfast in our room was on time, hot and very enjoyable and the evening meal was tasty.\nWe would definitely return to this hotel and highly recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:07:38.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
