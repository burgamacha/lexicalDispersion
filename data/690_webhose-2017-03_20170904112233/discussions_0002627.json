Sinai hospital. We found this on a list of nearby hotels. The property appears to have been built as condominiums, but is currently used as a hotel. Rooms appear to all be studio, one bedroom, or two bedroom apartments with complete kitchen. We booked a studio, but got a one bedroom with full kitchen, full size TV in living room and bedroom. Could stand some updating, but was complete and comfortable. We had intended one night only, but due to the Blizzard of 2017, we had to extend. Staff was was very accommodating, and although we couldn't keep the one bedroom we were in, they moved us to a two bedroom corner unit on a higher floor.\nWe have another trip due later in the month and will definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:12:59.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
