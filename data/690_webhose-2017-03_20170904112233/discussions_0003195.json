Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful.\nThe hotel is located next to the Gare St. Lazare, and just a few minutes walk from the Palais Garnier. We walked there to pick up a bus tour.\nThe rooms were on the small side, but that's to be expected in Paris. The bathrooms were rather large and luxurious, with heated floors and an incredible shower. Maybe the best shower I've ever used in a hotel.\nThe bar is an exceptionally beautiful room, and a great place to meet people.\nAs Diamond Hhonors members, we had access to the executive lounge for breakfast and early evening snacks/drinks. The breakfast was adequate for our needs, and the apps in the evening were good. My teenagers enjoyed the big jars of various candies.\nAll in all, a great stay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:19.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
