The hotel is on an old picturesque street and you can walk anywhere from here in central Rome. Spanish Steps metro station is 5 minutes away. There are also taxis on the square available at any time of the day. Piazza del Popolo is 10 minutes away. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The stuff was very pleasant and ready to help. They let me use their computer to buy a ticket to Vatican museum as I was not able to do it from my room. Very nice breakfast with fresh made cappuccino was available every day. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:20:36.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
