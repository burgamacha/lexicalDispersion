The staff were so friendly and our room was immaculate. The bed was extremely comfortable with lovely pillows. The bathroom was lovely with a great shower and luxury toiletries. There was a large mirror that was ideal for applying makeup and plenty of lighting. The Blind Spot downstairs was brilliant with delicious cocktails in a speakeasy style bar. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was quite expensive but the restaurant looked lovely from the outside. I'd definitely return to this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:24:06.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
