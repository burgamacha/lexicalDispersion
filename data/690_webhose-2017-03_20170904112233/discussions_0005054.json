The daily breakfast offerings hit the spot: baked goods, cheeses and meats, yogurt and fruits, eggs two ways, sausage or bacon, cereals, milk, 3 juice offerings, tea, coffee or milk. The rooms have a bathroom with two sinks and enough room for two to start preparing for the day. The bed was firm and comfortable. The rooms are only small if you plan to stay inside all day. The staff was helpful. The location is quiet and the Rue Cler is 200 yards away.
