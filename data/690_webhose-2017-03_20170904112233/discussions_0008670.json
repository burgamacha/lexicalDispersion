Its also a short walk from times square as well. The lobby is grand and always full of people. The rooms were rather average but it felt clean and it was fine with us as we weren't spending that much time there anyways. We found a deal online through a third party website that basically halved the price of a night here so it was worth it for what we payed. Paying the full price seemed a bit expensive. The rooms could use some work but overall plus the one we got was rather noisy which is common in hotels with older buildings but overall it was fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:39:27.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
