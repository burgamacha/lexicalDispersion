It is located closed to Opera on a charming backstreet with plentiful of restaurants and cafes in the surroundings. Rooms are modern and reasonably sized (I would suspect though that they vary in size), wifi is quick and without fuzz, very large modern LED TV. The breakfast buffet is small but well appointed, although the breakfast restaurant is on the lower level, lacking windows. There are plenty of breakfast options should you just walk out the door. All in all a very nice stay, happy to come back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:40:53.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
