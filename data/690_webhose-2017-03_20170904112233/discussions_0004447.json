First time visiting Paris and we would go back and stay here without a doubt. After spending hours searching the internet I came across this wonderful hotel. Perfect location- 5 mins from the Eiffel Tower which we could see from our room. Also close to metro and central for the perfect Paris trip. Room is small but modern and had everything plus me we needed. Wifi, iPads on loan and mini bar which was free and topped up daily. No noise from the road and beds we comity, rooms cleaned daily. The hotel staff were lovely, and we were made to feel very welcome, helped us with any questions we had and sorted out Disney tickets too. Didn't try the breakfast as we wanted to find little cafes, but it did look okay. If you stay here you wouldn't be disappointed as it was perfect for us over valentines.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:43:33.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
