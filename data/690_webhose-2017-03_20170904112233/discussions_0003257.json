Booked this hotel for three reasons .. 1) it's right by Olympia (2 mins walk). 2) it looked quirky and interesting and 3) it was only Â£70 a night.\nI was amazed at how awesome the location is. Two mins walk to the metro. 5 mins walk to Galleries Lafayette. 10 mins walk to the needle at the bottom of Champs Elysee. And about 15 mins walk to the Louvre. It's brilliant.\nHotel was spotlessly clean. Room was number 43. By the lift (no noise at all). It looked out into the street which was a great view at night. Room was beautiful, really lovely and spotlessly clean.\nReception staff I couldn't fault no matter what time of day or night it was. All polite.\nReception itself was lovely.\nWould 1 % visit this hotel again.\nWe didn't have breakfast here as went to little patisserie around the corner.\nDefinitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:41:17.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
