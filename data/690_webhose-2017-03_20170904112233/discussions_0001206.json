The HIE is about 4 blocks from Times Square, so it's not noisy or bright. The 34th Street/Herald Square subway stop is about a block and a half away, which took us everywhere we wanted to go (as long as you don't mind changing lines). Breakfast was typical, well stocked but nothing exciting. It got pretty busy around 8-9 am. The main downfall is the size of the room. With 2 beds, there was little extra room. Beds were a bit too firm. Bathroom has a sliding door to save room. It is near bars and restaurants and was very safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:42:22.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
