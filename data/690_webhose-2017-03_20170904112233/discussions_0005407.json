After a while it was mildly annoying and I was worried it would attach to me which wasn't ideal with a day of meeting ahead of me (it didn't).\nAside from that, its a great hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:21:36.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
