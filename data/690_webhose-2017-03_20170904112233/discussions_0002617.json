The location was ideal near the Barberini Metro station and just down the street from several bus stop routes, which eliminated the long walking distances to our daily destinations. The hotel was clean and safe, and had an elevator which saved my 83 year old mother from having to climb the stairs to her 3rd floor room. Daily breakfast was adequate, and the tiny bar offered morning cappuccino and evening aperitif. There are several restaurants nearby and the Trevi Fountain is a 5 minute walk away. We would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:07:25.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
