Rooms are large and clean for NYC and it is literally close to everything. Just around the corner is the empire state building and just a few minutes walk to times square. Breakfast is included and they have a very nice selection of hot and cold food. Kids loved it. Staff was very accommodating too. Will definitely come back here. Great place if you only have a few days to see the city. Very reasonable, especially for a family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:48:31.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
