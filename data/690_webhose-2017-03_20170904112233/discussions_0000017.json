We had a total of three rooms. This is a clean and well maintained hotel. Rooms are spacious and the beds are really comfortable. (Hampton Inn are my favorite beds). Parking and breakfast are included as part of your stay and breakfast has a good variety of hot and cold items. Reception staff (Theresa) was very friendly and professional and made check in/out very easy. Close to airport with a shuttle service. One thing to be aware of, this hotel is not located in a highly concentrated area of restaurants within short walking distance so youâ€™ll want to do some research on dining in the immediate area if you plan to eat by the hotel. Note, the Embassy Suites (next door) does have a restaurant so an easy place to get to. Overall, a very pleasant stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:06:02.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
