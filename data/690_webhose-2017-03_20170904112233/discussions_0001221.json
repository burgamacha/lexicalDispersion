During that time period, NYC was hit by Stella and many of the hotel staff was asked to stay on to accommodate guests. We received phenomenal service! A special shout out to David that went above and beyond meeting our needs (i.e., faxing information to my accountant, making dinner reservations for us, and setting up transportation to the airport). In addition he was always friendly even when the hotel was extremely busy due to weather issues. He always addressed me by my name.\nIn addition, my 14 year old son was on first name basis with Carlos who was incredibly helpful and friendly. Our room was cleaned every day and looked so inviting every evening when returning after our adventures.\nGreat customer service!!!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:42:19.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
