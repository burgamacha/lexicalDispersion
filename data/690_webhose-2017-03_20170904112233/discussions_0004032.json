It is in very close proximity to Place de Madelaine and there you can access two subway lines. It is also just a close walk to Le Louvre and La Fayette gallerias - perfect location.\nWe lived in a superior room and they were spacy enough, clean with a nice bathroom. Would definetly recommend this hotel for other travelers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:58:42.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
