Rooms were clean and the bed was good. Breakfast was great with plenty of goodies. Location is great as was the price. We were less than a block from the Spanish Steps. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel has been around since 1923. They were able to book us a car to take us to the airport cheaper and nicer than a taxi\nRoom Tip: Rooms with an outside view are good See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:20:22.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
