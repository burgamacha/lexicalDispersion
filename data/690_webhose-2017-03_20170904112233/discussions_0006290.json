The lobby, Resturant, bar, pool and garden are very well maintained. The views are great. I've stayed there twice and the staff are just fantastic. The food at the Resturant is excellent and there is often a buffet and the regular menu.\nThe rooms are very modern, appear to be recently remodeled and are exceptionally clean.\nThe hotel is very convenient to the airport and several restaurants and shops are nearby.\nThe drive to Kampala is treacherous. Official vehicles often will close part or all of the road. The traffic in Kampala is very heavy. After dealing with traffic to and from Kampala the Protea Entebbe was a very nice place to unwind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:50:37.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
