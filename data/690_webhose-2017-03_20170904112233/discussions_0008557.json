It was a lovely clean hotel in a good location, many attractions were within walking distance. The hotel staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.\nThe rooms were comfortable, our only complaint was that the pillows were all so very hard, and the hotel did not have any softer ones so we didn't sleep terribly well.\nWe had rooms on the same level as the hotel reception, it sounded like someone in the room above dragged furniture around the room every night. Apart from these little gripes the hotel was lovely and did what we wanted it too, breakfast was also included with our booking.\nYou have to remember that this is a city hotel, the city never sleeps and there is noise all night.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:04:47.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
