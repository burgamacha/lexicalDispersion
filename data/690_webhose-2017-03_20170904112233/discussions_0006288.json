However, I am surprised by all the raving stories about the service. I live in Africa and originate from Amsterdam, so I am used to slow (and in the case of Amsterdam: crap) service, but the service in the Serena Kampala is nothing to write home about either. The staff is super friendly but very, very slow (check-in took almost an hour because they couldn't find our reservation), a lot of miscommunications (the front desk sent us to the reservation office when we asked them to make a restaurant booking) , the concierge is clueless about his role (taxi? better to walk to the entrance and hail a moto). The food in the hotel is average at best and the breakfast buffet looks like it has been attacked by a herd of children by the time it is 9.30am.\nYou may wonder: why do you like to come here? Well, that is because the hotel really does have a relaxing influence when visiting a hectic city. The garden is beautiful (with very loud mating frogs noises), and it is a simple joy to relax in the bar area outside in the evening. The spa, gym and pool area are also excellent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:20:17.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
