The family party booked this hotel so we joined them.\nI think it's a tad expensive for what it provides but hey, that's New York all over.\nAs others have said the 'facilities fee' is $35 and compulsory, though we were lucky that the wedding party did negotiate a discount.\nIf you can afford the substantial premium for a park view room do go for it. The views of the park (especially after Storm Stella!) are spectacular.\nRooms are big and cleanish, but mostly very tired and in need of refurbs. Even the 44th floor suite we saw had the same standard of decoration. We first got a city view room on floor 9 which had a view of a wall and was next to noisy air con units. They moved us without fuss to floor 22 still city facing, but a better view and quieter.\nThe 5:00-7:00 'free' buffet was ok, there was tap beer, wines, water and soft drinks. Average food and some fruit. Nowhere near $35 per night though. Wifi worked ok and yes, international calls really are included.\nThe point of the hotel is the location. All the main subway lines are within a few minutes walk, and of course Central Park is across the street.\nWe didn't pay ($70!) for breakfast but there's an ok restaurant next door and a great food hall 50 metres away so that's an easy choice.\nStaff were perfunctory rather than pleasant, but everything we asked for they did or we got so no complaints.\nWe'd consider staying there again but would look around for alternatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:16:00.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
