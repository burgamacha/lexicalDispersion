My room had a great view of the city and was very easy to commute to the nearest subway. Room was clean, minimal, and modern. The breakfast buffet had coffee, juice, and breakfast options! Very happy with staying here, with great customer service, and a warm feel in a busy neighborhood.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with city view.
