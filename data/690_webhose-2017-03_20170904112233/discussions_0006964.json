It was on a side street and nice and quiet during our stay. It's within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, has some shops and cafes nearby in case last minute provisions are needed. It's also very easy to access by any train/underground that goes to Victoria, and also had very convenient buses from other parts of the City. They were happy to store our luggage when we arrived before the room was ready, but while we were there, a room opened up and we were able to take a welcome break after our long overnight flight. There's a lot of construction going on nearby including upgrades to Victoria Station, so I'm sure this will soon become an even more prime location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:08:25.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
