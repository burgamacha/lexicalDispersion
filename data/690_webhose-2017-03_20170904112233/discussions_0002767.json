It is in an excellent location - a few blocks from Times Square and right across from the discount Broadway show tickets. The subway stations are close, 5th avenue is within walking distance, Central Park is about a 20 minute walk. The rooms are a very nice size, with separate living room, small refrigerator, microwave, 2 tvs and a large size bathroom. I traveled with a close friend and there was plenty of room for us. There would be plenty for 4 people easily in these rooms. The beds were very comfortable. There wasn't much of a view (office building - very close) from our room, but we weren't in the room much anyway, so it really didn't matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:34:45.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
