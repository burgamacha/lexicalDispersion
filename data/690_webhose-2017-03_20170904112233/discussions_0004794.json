I have stayed at a couple chains before but this was my first venture into a boutique hotel stay and loved every minute of it. I must start off by saying that this was by far the most QUIET hotel I have ever stayed at in NYC! I lived in NYC for years and was shocked at how I did not her one siren/taxi/tonk during my stay! The rooms were also very spacious for an NYC hotel! Added bonus - everyone was beyond friendly and they gave you a ticket for a free glass of champagne or cocktail upon arrival! I am already planning to stay here for my next visit in May! I stayed here with 2 girlfriends in the queen suite and they even raved about how nice it was and I did a great job picking the hotel - extra win!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:14:38.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
