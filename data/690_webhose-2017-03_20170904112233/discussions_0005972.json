When it comes to hotels, mine involves a quick glance at the shower in any of the rooms. If it’s a dingy bathtub with a nylon curtain, it’s immediately ruled out as an outdated hotel that hasn’t seen a renovation in decades, with all the issues that entails. If it’s is a modern waterfall head with a glass screen door, the hotel is worth further inspection. In the case of the EVEN at W35th St., the shower was indeed indicative of the hotel’s modern and upbeat design, on top of perfect location for moving around midtown – less than a 5 minute walk from Penn station. Add to that powerful air conditioning and heating, endless supply of hot water, a gazillion channels on a huge flat-screen tv, free high speed wi-fi, large comfortable bed, well-equipped gym and friendly service - and there’s not much to complain about.\nHowever, two issues put a dent in the overall positive picture: (1) the room I was in had very limited storage space. Luckily, I was in town for only two nights and traveling light, but if it were more, it would’ve been a problem. (ii) the hotel’s 25 floors are serviced by only 2 elevators, which makes for long waits even under the best of circumstances. Unfortunately, in one of the mornings one of the elevators was out of order for a few hours, which is the equivalent of having half the NY subway system go down during rush hour. To their credit, the staff was very apologetic, called for immediate service and offered a generous discount as compensation for the discomfort.\nRoom Tip: keep to the lower floors in case of an elevator problem See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:39:55.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
