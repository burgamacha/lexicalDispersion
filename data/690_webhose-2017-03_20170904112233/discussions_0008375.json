As it is just off the main Rd, it is quiet at night. You can hardly hear any traffic noise at all.\nThe place is very modern and nicely decorated throughout. It is very clean and the hotel employees are kind, polite and helpful.\nThe room we stayed in, 103, was very comfy and spacious. The bathroom was very modern and again well appointed. It was also very clean. The only thing my wife did not like was that there was no actual kettle in the room. There was a coffee making machine, which made excellent coffee as you would expect. Unfortunately, she only drinks tea and the water did not get to actual boiling point in order to make a good cuppa. I dare say if we had asked they may have provided a kettle, but only staying 3 nights, we didn't bother.\nAll in all though, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. We will definitely be staying here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:21:41.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
