However a couldn't have been more happier,in fact I'm over the moon by the location,the rooms,the service and the staff\nLocation - your situated pretty much right outside the 9/11 memorial,world trade centre and 9/11 museum. You are a 20min subway ride from Times Square but once you get used to the subway routes extra your laughing,a mean $32 dollars for unlimited weeks travel is the best thing ever and it even takes you JFK (if your departing from there)\nRooms- pretty much what you need when your going to New York,we had a queen room then upgraded (for free a may add) to a suite with balcony which was amazing. Toilet room and shower facility's were perfect. As your not in the room that much your not wanting to spend a ton of money just to sleep and that's it. All rooms have cable tv,coffee machine and chilled water for your needs\nServices - on the 20th floor there was a nice roof top bar with a view of the memorial pools and the 1 world trade centre. Bar staff are friending and all ways having a laugh. Free juice and snacks available from down stair in the lobby along with computers for your perusal.\nThere are two massive shopping centres next to the hotel as well which a didn't know about until the 2nd last day.\nOverall this hotel is out the way from Times Square etc but the restaurants are a lot cheaper and it's good to get away from all the hustle and bustle to recharge.\nOn my return a will be staying here again with my family.\nAnd a big thanks to Mary and the rest of the staff for such friendly loving experience\nA hope to see you next February", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:31:25.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
