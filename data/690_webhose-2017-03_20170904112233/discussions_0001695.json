The staff is first-rate - attended to everything I asked for - and the hotel is simply exquisite. The decor is authentic Victorian with actual antiques everywhere. The food was delicious - I had the fresh-baked brioche toast with homemade cheese and marmalade topped with the thinnest slices of tomato - delicious - and the coffee was excellent as well! The evening before we had quite a party in the bar - everyone at our firm attended - and the most tasty Baked Alaska I have ever eaten. I am very much looking forward to a return trip in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:57:27.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
