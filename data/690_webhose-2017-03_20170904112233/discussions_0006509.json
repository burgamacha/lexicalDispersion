Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff. Cozy, industrial chic. Very fair rate. Very warm atmosphere in the lobby. Always seem to be people city and relaxing there by the big windows and nice cafe. Great location as well. Only thing I would improve is to add a flex light on the second side of the king bed. The valet parking is a terrific deal - just be aware it is a little difficult on arrival if you don't find a spot on street and plan for a little wait when you leave.\nAmazing find - will direct all my friends there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:23:02.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
