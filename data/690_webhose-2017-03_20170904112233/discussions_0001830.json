During our 3 nights stay we much appreciated the spot on service and hospitality of all staff including the excellent housekeeping, the front desk staff as well as the servers in the lobby bar and both restaurant in the Beekman Hotel where we had dinner. A special thank you goes to the very friendly and charmfull concierge team who are true professionals of their trade. Our room was very beautifully decorated and pretty large.
