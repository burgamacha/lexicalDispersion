It is spotlessly clean and neat. The small rooms are really small, not even room for a chair, but for a single person for 2 nights it was fine. The complimentary breakfast was very good. There is a restaurant, bar and coffee bar in the hotel and the items I had were very nice. The staff was professional and classy and very nice. It was my first time to NYC and they were very helpful and in their words \"welcomed me to town\". My room was really quiet. Downstairs the coffee bar and regular bar seem to be a gathering spot for locals as well and the living room like atmosphere with a warm fireplace were full of activity. Dogs were welcome as well at least downstairs. It is a great location if you can walk... 40 minutes to Times Square going north and 40 minutes to the World trade going south. Great restaurants all around the area. Airlink Shuttle (Green) from Newark airport was awful.\nRoom Tip: For 2 folks, get bigger room, the airport shuttle the hotel booked for me to airport was very good...
