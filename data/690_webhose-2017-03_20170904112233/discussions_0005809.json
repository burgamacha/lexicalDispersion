I saw one review that the location was bad, but it all depends. We work in the garment industry, and the hotel is conveniently located; not far from the Javits Center, and there are some nice small restaurants on 9th Ave. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is pet-friendly and didn't charge us a pet \"fee\" which was great. The room was clean, well-equipped and updated. The included breakfast was one of the better I've seen in a reasonably-priced hotel, and they have a deal for a parking discount at a garage 3 blocks away. Prices in NYC can vary wildly depending on what's going on in town, but at the price we paid it was an excellent deal. We'd definitely stay there again.\nRoom Tip: Rooms not on the street side are very quiet; which is very unusual in NYC.
