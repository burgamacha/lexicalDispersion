Good service\n2. Smart contemporary decor throughout\n3. Excellent rooms with good bathroom\n4. Good in-room facilities\n5. Tasty food in restaurant\n6. Swift room service (forgot to bring my Ice though!)\nCon's:\n1. Hi-Tech in-room control feature did not control A/C in my room. Despite having such advanced technology on hand I was unable to cool my room! (Nice idea if it works)\n2. Expensive Bar food. Not great value for money.\nOverall - happy during my stay. Hotel is great. Trendy, arty types will really love it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:18.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
