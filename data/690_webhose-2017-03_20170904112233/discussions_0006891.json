We flew over from Ireland for st. Patrick's day. Got an upgraded room because it was our honey moon to a fantastic room with an excellent view. Hotel staff were so friendly and helpful especially John who worked at the guest relations desk one of the nicest men I have ever met. He sorted us out with all we needed even got us a taxi when we were leaving and personally carried our bags out for us. Would Definitely recommend this hotel for a visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:43:20.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
