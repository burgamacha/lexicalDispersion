Never had to wait at check-in and the reception has always been friendly. Plus points - clean & comfy beds, quiet accommodation, clean bathrooms with good water pressure and fluffy towels. Breakfast is usual Premier Inn and the staff are friendly.\nGreat connections by rail and I love Westfield shopping centre right on the doorstep.\nOnly \"downsides\" are that it's not cheap and not all of floors have a great view.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a view, some have a stunning view of London.
