In looking for a larger room, and driving into Paris from the south, this hotel fit the bill. The hotel is attached to a mall.. so very convenient location for shopping and restaurants. Parking deck attached to the mall. Metro is across the street for easy access to all of the main attractions. We had two rooms, one had a kind sized bed with a living area and pull out sofa and the other had two twins/ living area with pull out sofa. The rooms are modern and clean. Small kitchenette and fridge was great to store drinks and snacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:32:49.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
