The room was nicely furnished, spacious, and had a balcony. We enjoyed having breakfast each morning, although it would have been nice to have some variation as the buffet was the same every day. The location is fine - at the end of the street there are two bus lines which take you to the Vatican in 15 minutes. We tended to walk from there to see the sights of Rome.\nWe would happily stay here again. The only improvement I would like to see is in the restaurant - we went on the night we arrived and the staff were a bit miserable, there was no atmosphere, and the menu is a bit expensive. After that we tended to eat in the City centre before returning to the hotel, but it wasn't a problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:18:01.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
