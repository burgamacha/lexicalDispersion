In past trips we have found the people of Paris to be a bit standoffish, but this was definitely not the case on this trip. My husband and I were travelling with our college aged son, and were given an upgraded executive room with plenty of room for a bed for him to be brought in. This room was very large by European standards. We did not find the room worn at all - everything was in perfect condition and was quite luxurious and lovely. We were also given access to the Club Lounge, where we had excellent service, particularly by Ignazio, Ernesto and Miyumi (I may be spelling her name incorrectly). Also wonderful was Louise at the concierge desk, who recommended wonderful restaurants that fit our criteria perfectly. She handled all of the reservations without fuss. The location of the hotel is excellent, and although expensive, was well priced considering its location and the prices of other luxury hotels in the area. Our room was on the third floor facing Rue Scribe, and we did not hear any noise at night. I would happily stay at this hotel again on a return trip.\nRoom Tip: Room on Rue Scribe - quiet at night.
