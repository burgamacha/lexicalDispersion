Small boutique style with super Marriott service. By Paris standards this room was huge. King bed in one area and a double memory foam sofa bed in the living area. Bathroom thoughtfully arranged for a family. Separate shower, toilet areas plus a tub and sink. Robes, slippers...the works. Coffee and tea makers in the room. If the hotel restaurant is still under reno when you arrive here is a tip concerning the breakfast menu: the Continental Breakfast is the best value. It includes coffee and many, many other items....the menu is a little hard to understand. But we finally got it right!\nThe area is very lovely and safe for walking. Close to the Louvre, Tuileries, Rue de Rivoli and fab shopping. The concierge team is simply wonderful and the desk crew on top of everything. They made a fuss about the birthday and our grand daughter was just thrilled.\nBetween this hotel and The Marriott on the Champs Elysees, I think I like this property better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:14:28.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
