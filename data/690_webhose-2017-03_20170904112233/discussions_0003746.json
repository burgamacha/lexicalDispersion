However when I asked for an upgrade to an executive room and get access to the lounge as a gold member, the staff, who appeared to be quite junior, explained it would be for a fee. later on after we got settled in our room, I ran into a manager and asked her. She was able to find us an upgrade for our next night without a problem.\nBreakfast was great. room decor was modern and lovely. location was convenient. However both my husband and myself couldn't stop sneezing once we step into the room - i suspect the room was either dusty or some other pollutant that made us non-stop sneezing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:15:36.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
