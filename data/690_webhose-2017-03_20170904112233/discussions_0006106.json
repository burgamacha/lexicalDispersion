We stayed at the 7th Arrondissement at the Hotel de L' Empereur over looking Les Invalides & Musee de Le Armee. It was a great hotel, with a wonderful warm hostess. There was a Laverie (Laundrette) at the top of our street for those who like to do their own laundry & close by was a cafe & small neighbourhood restaurant. When we travel I always like to know where the closet Laundry is. The hotel had a quaint 2 person lift which took us up to our room. The hotel was perfect & within easy walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, where Napoleon is buried & the Army Museum is domiciled. We also walked to the Musee Rodin & Musee de Orsay (which we both loved), but unfortunately the Decorative Arts part of the Museum was undergoing renovation & would not be completed until 2018. From our hotel, we could view Invalides. A good pair of walking shoes is required as well as a sun hat when one goes out walking. The hotel serves breakfast with fantastic freshly squeezed orange juice or one can go to the many cafes near the metro station for a great breakfast. We found the staff in all the eating establishments to be very friendly & accommodating. We ate Sea Bass near the Opera de Paris, one evening, which was delicious. There weren't many people about but the setting was magical. Obviously with the terrorism events which were happening in Paris at the time, we did see more Police about moving homeless people along.\nWe highly recommend this hotel & the closeness of all the sites we wanted to visit. The Metro was just down the street & Hop on, Hop off buses were every where.\nThis was our 2nd visit to Paris & honestly one never tires of this beautiful City.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:36.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
