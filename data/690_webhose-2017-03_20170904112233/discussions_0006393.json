I was expecting the worst and had been dreading the overnight stay for a while but was pleasantly surprised. thank god..!\nThe room was refurbished to a decent (budget hotel) standard.. It was clean, inviting and modern. There could be small improvements /maintenance to the bathroom door and inside the bathroom. I do recommend rubber slippers to use in there as its more like a wet room and I feel better with some slippers on.\nThe staff were excellent - very friendly and helpful. A credit to the hotel.\nPerfect location and 5min walk to stratford station, westfield shopping centre etc.\nwould I stay here again.. yes..!\nRoom Tip: 305 was a good room.
