Its position is pretty good: just few steps from Westminster underground station or Pimlico as well.\nWe have been really satisfied by the breakfast buffet. An outstanding availability of everything you can desire for your breakfast: full typical british breakfast, or a continental one. A really good way to start your day, surrounded by the kind and gentle hotel's crew.\nRooms are wide enough to stay in a comfortable way, the daily cleaning service works pretty well. Very appreciated the solution of the iMac on the desk, which works also as TV (with international satellitar TV canals), but when needed a desktop PC can be very useful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:03:43.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
