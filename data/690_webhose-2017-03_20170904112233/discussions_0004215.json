The hotel is beyond charming and comfortable--it is a home away from home, We booked far enough in advance that we were able to request a specific room that had given us such happiness before (#5). The staff is unrelentingly gracious and welcoming. You will see them frequently throughout the day and you will be welcomed with great warmth. The room itself is spacious and absolutely comfortable, the bath is amazing with a large tub and a great shower. Housekeeping is perfect. There is a very nice breakfast buffet as well. On top of all that, the hotel is excellently situated on the Left Bank--near transport in all directions, but also within walking distance of museums (Louvre, d'Orsay, Cluny) and great restaurants. We cannot wait to return!\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing the courtyard are quiet.
