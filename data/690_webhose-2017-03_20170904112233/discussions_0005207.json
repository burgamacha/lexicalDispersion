Staff was wonderful and helpful. Beds were plush and soft and very comfortable. This hotel was in the center of everything Times Square. Our room was located on the 32 floor, and with Black-out curtains on every room, you could sleep peacefully and quietly anytime of the day. This hotels staff was wonderful. Elevators were lightning fast, there were 6 of them, breakfast was pricey but was great, over 10 other restaurants within 1/2 block if you want anything else. ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS HOTEL...
