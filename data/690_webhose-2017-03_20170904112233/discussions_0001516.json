And the room is very spacious, and there is the transparent glass panel for the bathroom, which will be a big bonus and delight for honeymoon couples.\nI took the opportunity to enjoy a glass of Bordeaux wine on the first day of my check-in. And on the second night, I chose to eat at the hotel restaurant to try their food. I had lamb meat with parsnip. Wow, the parsnip was prepared in a creamy sauce, and I simply love the taste and the texture. Thumbs up to the Chef. Before my main course, I was also offered some swordfish puree and I liked the taste of it too.\nThe room is very nice, and my bed is very comfortable for the two nights there. At the hotel, there is a concierge and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.\nThere is a spa and also a fitness centre here, but I didn't get to use them. The metro station is within minutes of walking from the hotel. Just outside of the hotel, there are a number of restaurants ranging from French, Italian, Korean hotpot, as well as the fast food chain of MACDonalds, Burger King and KFC. It is a short drive from here into the city centre with the attractions of the iconic landmark of the Eiffel Towerï¼Œ Notre Dame Cathedral, Arc De Triomphe which was built by the order of Napoleon and many others.\nI would really recommend all others to stay here.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:15:12.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
