Despite of its name, the hotel located in quite peaceful part of the Termini, about distance of 10 minutes walking from the station. The location is great and if you are ready to walk a little, you could just visit all main attractions by foot.\nSmooth Hotel Termini has 24/7 reception, which was one reason we chose this hotel. Staff in hotel was very kind and helpful. If you had something on your mind, you could just ask.\nThe room itself was nice, neat and modern with a little balcony and it was cleaned daily. Some extra chairs or table would have been nice, now we just kept our belongings inside our bags on the floor. Room was very quiet and peaceful and there was a flat screen TV with couple of international channels. WiFi was working great and the Internet was fast enough for Netflix.\nThe breakfast was great, nothing really special but anyway worth to pay for! My wife loved those tiny pannacottas.\nWe would definitely stay again in Smooth Hotel Termini!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:39:09.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
