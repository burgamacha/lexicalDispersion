The rooms are what you'd expect in NYC..just big enough for 2 people to comfortably maneuver around. I usually travel by myself but once had my husband with me. The other hotels I've stayed in would have been uncomfortable for 2.\nRooms are clean and if you face away from watts street, they're quiet. If you do face watts, I hope you invest in some ear plugs because the entrance to the Holland tunnel is noisy, no matter what floor you're on.\nThe staff are friendly and the Otis spunkmeyer cookies at the front are a nice touch. The free breakfast is standard - no real complaints.\nLocation and price can't be beat if you're spending time in TriBeCa/soho area. A nice 10 min walk to the east village for some good eats too. The 1 train is just around the corner and the CE is nearby if you need to go uptown.\nOnly downside to this hotel, aside from being right on watts st, is the slooowww elevator. Give yourself an extra 5 min in the morning if you're coming from a high floor.\nDefinitely recommend if you're here on business.\nRoom Tip: High floor facing uptown is preferred See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:18:32.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
