We had a double queen room on the 15th floor.\nThe hotel is beautiful. The rooms are a good size, for Manhattan. Very tastefully decorated and with everything we needed for a great stay.\nI can't say enough about the friendly and super fast customer service at this hotel. Every staff member we came in contact with was wonderful. Requests for extra items were delivered super fast!\nThe street is away from the \"hub bub\" of Times Square, but the subway lines on 28th street make everything close by. The street is quiet with the beautiful sites of the flower district.\nI highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:40:53.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
