We had a street view room which is absolutely no problem as you cannot hear any outside noise whilst the windows are closed!!\nWe had a couple of drinks in the discrete cocktail bar, there was good choice on the drinks menu with prices very comparative for the area of London that the hotel is situated in. However, I did feel that the service in the bar wasn't as high as I would have expected it to be.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all throughout our two night stay due to prior bookings at other venues.\nOn the Saturday evening before we left for dinner, we were disappointed with not being able to use the bar for a drink due to a prior room booking. We were advised that we could go into another room where we would be served. To us, this looked simply like a meeting room and lacked any type of atmosphere etc.\nOverall, a very enjoyable stay for our anniversary!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:21:26.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
