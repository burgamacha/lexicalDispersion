My daughter's stuffed animal was lost in the room or linen, and they were so helpful in trying to retrieve it. They even went the extra step and purchased and sent her one from Paris to LA after we returned home!!!\nThey were also so helpful when we needed to find a doctor.\nRoom service was delicious.\nEverything was beautiful here, but the personalities of the staff at the front desk and the valets/bellman were wonderful!!!\nWhen the people who work at a hotel are so friendly and kind and happy, it really makes a difference in the energy of the place.\nWe l ved it.\nMy kids didnt want to leave the room some times. The room service was THAT good for them.\nhahahahah!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:48:31.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
