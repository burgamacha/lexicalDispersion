If you love shopping and charm, this is the hotel for you. The breakfast was a typical Italian buffet, heavy on the sweets, but good cafe Americano. The bed was very hard, but all of our beds were that way in Italy. Our room was a bit odd because it was a triple when we asked for a double. The bed was upstairs, but the bathroom was downstairs with an extra bed, desk, and chair. The bath was huge and had a good shower. The staff were helpful with reservations, taxis and directions.
