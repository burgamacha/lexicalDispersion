The price was right. The location is 6 blocks from restaurant row and 6 blocks to the garden. The rooms are very small as is the hotel. Our room had some problems even though it was newly renovated ( A/C wasn't working, bathroom faucet tough to turn on). The maintenance person was extremely friendly and fixed the A/C. The rooms were very clean. But more importantly, the staff at this hotel was better than I've ever seen in all of my travels in the country, something you don't always see especially in NYC. The hotel manager was always present and friendly. The bar tender, Anthony was great and super friendly too. The only person that we ran in to that wasn't good was the waiter in the restaurant. He messed up my order, wouldn't write it down at first, and never came back to check on us. The hotel restaurant puts out a wonderful breakfast for a very reasonable price.\nRoom Tip: I had to call to request that two double beds were guaranteed.
