We can not speak highly enough about this hotel. The staff were absolutely wonderful! Helping us navigate the city, restaurant recommendations and any other tips and hints. Every morning we were greeted by the hotel reception and the chef at breakfast for our breakfast orders. Breakfast was absolutely delicious and in a nice cosy room. Our room was clean and very charismatic. We had a little terrace off our room and were able to sleep with the windows open. The room was also very spacious, enough for us to do a little workout in each morning (you need to after so much pizza and pasta!). I would 100% come back to this hotel, I wouldn't even think twice about going elsewhere. You will not be disappointed with this hotel, I guarantee!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:32:36.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
