All are easily within walking distance from here.\nThe interior of the hotel is beautiful; from the 1930s in the Art Deco style and really well preserved from that time. Rooms at the front of the hotel have a great view of the Empire State and Chrysler Building. The sunrise has to be seen.\nThe food on site is good; there's a diner serving American classics that's open 24/7 and a bar on site.\nOnly issue is the bathroom was a little cramped but for the age of the hotel was in a nice condition; nothing was broken and the shower is reasonably powerful.\nI've stayed here twice now and would certainly stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:43:26.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
