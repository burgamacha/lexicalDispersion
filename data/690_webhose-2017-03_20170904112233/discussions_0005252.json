The room looked quite simply adorable, and even though it was up against the main street there was no noise! The only minor objection with the room was that the bathroom could have done with some minor maintenance. The location is about as perfect as anything can be in any city in the world, and we wish we'd used the expertise of the staff earlier - the second we asked about a 'good place to eat', the extremely helpful man at the front desk started looking at places (we wanted something with 'at least' a recommendation in the Michelen guide) and found one that fit our special desires, getting us a table the same afternoon - and the restaurant was just 200 meters up the road! The breakfast was also good and typical to what you'd expect in France. Unfortunately we slept too well to experience it most days..!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:27:59.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
