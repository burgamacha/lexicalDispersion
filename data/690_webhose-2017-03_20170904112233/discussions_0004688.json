Breakfasts had a nice selection of hot foods as well as the 'regular' foods usually served at most places.\nService was friendly and helpful, particularly Syndia and Aneka for the breakfast meals and Brad in the lobby.\nThe hotel is located directly across from the Port Authority which has both a positive and a negative side. The positive is that you get to meet a wonderful people traveling to and from a variety of countries, The negative is that the area is a bit 'seedy' (being somewhat dark at night) with many transient folks all around.\nOur room was always well cleaned.\nWe felt that one of the best things was that you couldn't hear noise from next door. They spent the money to put great insulation between the rooms. We loved that.\nAlso, they have three elevators, so more folks could be accommodated at one time.\nHowever, be prepared to definitely wait for your room until 4 pm.\nRoom Tip: Higher flloors have better views. Request to be away from the elevators. See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:44:53.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
