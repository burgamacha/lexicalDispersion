The staff were always helpful (which we find at all the Premier Inns that we use) and welcoming. There were some very minor issues with our room which did not detract from our stay at all. We had booked 3 rooms and each was different in size - one was very large (we guessed it is usually used as a family room) and that was great because it meant we could use that one as the meeting place for us all. We walked to Bank, a slow meander, in about 20 minutes (and, by chance, saw the new Mary Poppins being filmed - which was exciting!). Aldgate East is a short walk away too. The only problem was getting taxis and that is due to the fringe City location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:26:43.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
