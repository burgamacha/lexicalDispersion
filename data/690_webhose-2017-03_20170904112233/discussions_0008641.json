The room was tidy, the aircon/heat worked well, the shower was warm, and the window view totally made up for the small room. The location is great for exploring both Manhattan and Brooklyn as several subway lines as close by. The neighbourhood itself is also full of hip restaurants, bars, cafes, shops, galleries and museums. We definitely recommend this!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:38:44.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
