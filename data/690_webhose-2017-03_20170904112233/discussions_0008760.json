I've stayed here before many years ago and decided to stay again for the location for our visit. It's right near Paddington station ( tube and mainline trains) and good bus service too\nWe were arriving on a very early flight (04:55am) so I booked the hotel from the night before so we could get in straight away and not have to wait until check in time. Even though we booked months in advance, we were limited with the choice so had to book a family room.\nWe arrived at the hotel just after 6am and the staff were very friendly and we got into our room straight away. We were in the basement area but there was plenty of light and the room was very spacious. Right near the breakfast room and laundry but not noisy. I would request this room again as I liked the location and the size\nThe room had everything you could want. Lovely big bathroom with a bath ( bonus for me I love a bath) all toiletries replaced daily. Plenty of hot water. Fridge and tea/coffee making facilities\nBreakfast was included and was continental and Full English. You could feast on as much as you liked. Staff in the breakfast room were excellent. Especially Adrianne ( I think that was her name) she helped me with the laundry as some inconsiderate guest had used the machine and dryer to do their laundry and then left it there so no one else could use it. I stood there for 20mins waiting for them to come back. Adrianne came to my rescue and took the clothes out and put them in a bag so I could use the machine ( thank you) it's not the hotels fault but maybe a sign in the laundry room to remind guests to be vigilant of the time their washing takes to do and come back to remove it so other guests can use the machine. It's great having that facility but people are rude in not thinking of others\nApart from that which wasn't anything to do with the hotel, we had a wonderful time and I will be back with my husband in October. Really lovely stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:50:58.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
