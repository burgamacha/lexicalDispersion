Too little time! The hotel staff is so great. Very accommodating to all requests. Definitely do the executive club if possible. Lounge access is totally worth it. I must've had about three cappuccinos a day and the breakfast is great. The location is perfect. A short way to central and close to many restaurants and shops. Angel station is literally around the corner. Don't worry if you forgot to pack adapters the hotel staff will lend you some! It's like they think of everything. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:34:35.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
