You have several transport options close by. In about 20 minutes metro ride you are in the centre; but you can relax away from the tourist areas an feel more like a local in the hotel surroundings.\nThe room is on the small side of things but more than perfect for a few days. It has on-suite facilities, tv, safe, phone. It was a surprise the fact that the hotel lends you free of charge a smart mobile phone with unlimited local and international phone calls and internet access at not extra cost at all.\nThe breakfast was actually quiet nice with a variety of things available. Well worth having it included on your hotel fare.\nThe staff was very polite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:27:20.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
