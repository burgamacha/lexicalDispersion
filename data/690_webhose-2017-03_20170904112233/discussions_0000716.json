From the moment of arrival the team could not do enough for us and we knew we were going to have a fabulous stay! Jacques was particularly welcoming and showed us to our beautiful room which we could not fault! Add to that brilliant service in the bar (my husband definitely enjoyed the famous egerton martini!) and returning from dinner to find our room adorned with rose petals and candles and I don't think the stay could have been any more special!! Thanks to all the team for making our weekend :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:42:01.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
