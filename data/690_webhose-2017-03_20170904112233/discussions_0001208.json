You can catch the train from Rome airport on the non stop train into central Rome, Termini station, fare 15 Euros, service very efficient, you can either buy tickets from a kiosk or from the machine which is very easy to use.\nHotel reception staff gave us a map and circled the main sites and how long to walk or go by train. Restaurants are everywhere, stayed for 4 nights and ate at different places all very good. Bowl of pasta varies from 5 - 9 Euros, if you are on a budget very cheap to eat out.\nBreakfast at the hotel was very good. Coffee was served at the table and a good variety of food on offer, cooked breakfast was very nice.\nRooms were small but had everything needed. The only negative was the road was very busy and you could hear a lot during the night, but it's a city and we took in the atmosphere of this.\nWould definitely stay here again.\nRoom Tip: Avoid rooms on the road, if traffic noise bothers you at night.
