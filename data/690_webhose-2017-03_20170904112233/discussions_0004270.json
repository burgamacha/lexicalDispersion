Professional, friendly, clean, quiet and affordable by NYC standards. From check in to check out I was handled graciously by the staff including Faye, Ashley and Netanya.\nIt is a smaller property, but with a luxury feel. Boutique done right! You have to be an avid traveler to understand the simple enjoyment of a helpful, friendly staff. It makes everything better when they want the best for you. These guys did.\nBe warned, to the novice traveler, a queen room may be compact. But the fine bedding and sparkling clean bath is all you really need when you're in the city that never sleeps. It's perfect for the solo traveler or a couple who really likes each other. The FREE wifi in your room is a great perk. Also, the location is great if your plans include broadway shows. I walked to 3 of them!!! In the freezing cold!! It's that ez!\nThey treated me like a guest...that's all I ask for. I will be back!\nRoom Tip: In NYC, the higher you can go, the less noise.
