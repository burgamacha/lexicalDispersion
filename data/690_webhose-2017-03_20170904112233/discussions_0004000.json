Staff is friendly, rooms are quite basic, with a noisy air conditioning.\nIt covers the loud outside sound that is not filtered by the windows.\nThe bathroom is small, with basic faucets, the water is from the roof tank: you'd rather not drink it.\nThe restaurant offers African and Indian food. It is a bit more expensive than in some other nice places around also because the prices on the menu don't include the VAT.\nI appreciate a lot the thorough cleaning of outside furnitures that otherwise are quickly covered with dust.\nThe hotel has also a fitness room with rather old gear and a sauna that I had not tried.\nThird time I stay at this hotel that is not a bad choice. The other better rated ones in this area are far more expensive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:19:11.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
