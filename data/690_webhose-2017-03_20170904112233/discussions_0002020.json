Nice sized rooms. Since we don't tend to use hotel services, a friendly, comfortable 3 star hotel is perfect for us. What stands our in my mind is how all the staff are kind and easy to work with. Sometimes you see what people are really like when there is a problem. There was a problem with a drain in our first room. Carlos worked on it and encouraged us to let him know if there was anything more he ccould do. We ended up changing rooms at the hotel's suggestion. No hassle. By the way, a blizzard warning kept us in NY for an extra day and the hotel proved to be helpful once again. These people want you to be happy. Also good service from David at the front desk. If they can help, they will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:03:52.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
