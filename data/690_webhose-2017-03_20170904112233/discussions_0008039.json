The rooms are nice, the bed has the best mattress I have experienced. I have statues in 3 different rooms now and all have been a positive experience. It is quiet, modern, and comfy.\nThe breakfast is not the best I have had, the scrambled eggs are not recommended but overall it has what you need to have a good start of the day. It is a typical Novotel breakfast..\nThe staff is very friendly and always smiling.\nI haven't tried the spa area yet but hope to do so the next time I stay there.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:50:44.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
