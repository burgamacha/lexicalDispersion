I wanted top see if it was a one trick pony or the real deal. As it turns out, it is the is everything I had hoped it would be.\nThe location is great. Tucked away on a quite street but with everything in walking distance. Shopping, dining and attractions are all there.\nThe room (I was kindly upgraded to the junior suite) was amazing.

Modern yet cozy. A double door for absolute silence. Perfectly appointed with great lighting controls and fantastic bathroom. The robes and in room coffee maker didn't hurt either.\nThe staff was once again awesome. Super helpful but casual enough that you felt at home asking any question. You can tell that they put a lot of work and into the place and take pride in what they do.\nBreakfast was great and worth the money although my breakfast was included. I wanted to try a breakfast place down the street and it was ver good (see Bread & Roses). But the hotels breakfast was much better and less expensive. The young lady who prepares everything is super sweet and greets you with a smile that makes you happy to start your day.\nSo the verdict is obvious. You are in Paris.
