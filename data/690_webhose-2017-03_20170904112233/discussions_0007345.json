Offered a glass of wine and nibbles and informed about the history of the place. Our room was beautifully decorated Plasma tv tea and coffee making facilities and we were left a small bottle of red wine everyday.\nOur bed was super comfortable, fresh sheets and towels everyday. The room was always spotless on our return each evening.\nBreakfast was amazing. Barbara and her team made us feel so welcome and there was a great choice of food and all beautifully presented\nStaff were always on hand to help and inform. So genuinely friendly\nSo impressed with this wonderful hotel. Fantastic location beside the historic centre right beside the Forum and only a short walk to the Colosseum . What a find! We will definitely stay when we return to Rome", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:30:36.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
