This hotel isn't fancy, it's a standard, solid Sheraton hotel. But it's super clean, comfortable bed, around the corner from a Whole Foods, cool coffee shops, 10 minute walk to the Highline, etc. I would stay here again for sure for work or fun. The pub attached is cool too - stopped in for a beer & soup and the staff is super friendly, good beer selection. They also give you free bottled water, which is great because I kept forgetting to buy it while out. I ordered room service and my food came pretty quickly and was good. Overall a great stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:22:55.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
