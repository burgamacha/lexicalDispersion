The hotel was conveniently located to subway lines that enabled quick travel to Columbia, NYU, Barnard and other colleges. We compliment the hotel management on presenting clean, luxurious and spacious accommodation along with a very entertaining evening bar and sumptuous breakfast selection in the morning -- both European and American choices. The clientele is primarily French and western European and it was pleasurable to meet other people in a comfortable setting. The room rates are not inexpensive and the $33/person charge for breakfast seems rather exorbitant. But the Novotel proved to be an excellent choice, conveniently located to Times Square, theatrical shows, high-end shopping and Central Park. Our choice of the Novotel was also influenced by our desire to travel with our Boston terrier -- pets are welcome at no extra charge, a feature that one would never expect at an American-operated hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:10:24.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
