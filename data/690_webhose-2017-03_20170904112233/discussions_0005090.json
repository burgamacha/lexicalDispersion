The hotel is conveniently located nearby many of Paris' top sightseeing spots, transportation and many wonderful restaurants. I had breakfast downstairs several mornings and the service was always friendly and superb. My room was a bit dark, but that is about the only complaint I had. However, the real reason I felt compelled to write a review of this hotel is because of Ludovic and the kind hotel staff. I foolishly checked out of my room and left 3 shirts sitting on the closet shelf. I didn't realize this until I arrived at my next hotel in a different country and was trying to figure out why I was missing some shirts. I contacted the hotel via email and Ludovic took my shirts to the post office and mailed them to my home. I will DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again the next time I am in Paris. Thank you very much Ludovic!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:50:30.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
