The room was beautiful. We especially appreciated the kitchenette. There were two markets easily walk-able, which made morning tea and breakfast easier for us. However, if you prefer there is a cafe attached to the hotel and several spots within two blocks to grab food. If there hadn't been a blizzard two days earlier the balcony for morning tea would have been great. The staff answered all questions we had and were lovely (Miguel was particularly great). We loved the location and found we could walk almost everywhere. The subway is right up the street.\nIf you are noise sensitive (which I'm not), bring ear plugs. This hotel is generally quiet but you're still in the heart of the City. Our mattress was a tiny bit firm but it's better than too soft. We'll look forward to another stay in the future.\nRoom Tip: Ask for an upper floor room with a balcony.
