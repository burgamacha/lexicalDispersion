Efficient check especially liked the online function which meant the room key was ready when i arrived (look for the dedicated person on the front desk if there is a queue at all). Good atmosphere in the bar area, arrived too late for food. Breakfast was excellent and well organised and good coffee. Speedy check another good point. I used the business area during the morning which was a quiet area for meetings with a good tea/coffee service. An excellent Novotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:55:22.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
