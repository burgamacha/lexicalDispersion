Charming welcome by reception staff followed by a large room which had everything we needed. We heard no noise from other rooms and well rested the following morning we enjoyed our complimentary breakfast. The eating area was spotless and the food topped up regularly with plenty of choice. The hotel shuttle was a godsend as well bringing us from the airport and then back in the morning so we could pick up our rental car. We would certainly use this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:04:28.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
