When we found this one at a very reasonable price we were thrilled. Additionally, it is only a few mins walk from tube stations and a stroll away from Portobello Market, Notting Hill, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.\nThe room was spacious and clean with very comfortable beds. The bathroom had a good shower but was a tad on the small side for getting dry, however this is because the room itself had plenty of space.\nThere were tea and coffee facilities, a fridge, a safe and basic toiletries included. Unfortunately our milk cartons were off but reception rectified this immediately.\nThe reception staff were efficient and helpful but could do to be a little warmer.\nOverall a good hotel in a cracking location. We will be back.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:07:43.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
