We started with the No4 ranking on TripAdvisor. The room is super clean and tastefully decorated, service is flawless and the bed is really comfortable. It is conveniently located in Knightsbridge and the staff offer great advice for tourists. I love their romantic turndown service in the evening and you simply must try Esley's famous Martini. I love the breakfast taken in the room, all was cooked to perfection. Do ask for their fresh kale juice and beetroot juice. I'd be happily spend the rest of my trip here If I wasn't moving to The Milestone Hotel and Hotel 41 after. In all, a wonderful experience.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:37:56.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
