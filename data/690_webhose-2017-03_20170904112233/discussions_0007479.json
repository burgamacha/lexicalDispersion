We booked a 2/2 suite looking over Central Park for my 40th birthday. Champagne upon arrival, early check-in at 10:30! Always greeted by name throughout the week, including surprise balloons and more champagne in the room on my acutal birth day. Additional coordinated Events throughout the week we done easily with the concierge staff, room service, and Pete, an amazing man from guest relations. Al, who ran bell station was always charming and didn't hesitate to welcome our own guests who decided to share a limo ride back to the airport. He immediately stowed their bags while they joib us for a light lunch in the lounge prior to departure. We requested a later checkout at 12:15 with ease. I've stayed at 7 different Ritz-Carlton properties over the past few years, but this was my first at this particular location. 10 out of 10. My expectations were not only met, but thoroughly exceeded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:33:13.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
