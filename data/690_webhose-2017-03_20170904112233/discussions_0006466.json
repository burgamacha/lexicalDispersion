Left luggage facility. Easy to get to by bus or tube -Aldgate East nearest but easy walk from Aldgate. Fairly new so rooms in very good condition, no opening windows in rooms, very clean in all areas. Didn't use any resteraunts but looked nice choices. Also some vending machines in lobby for drinks, snacks, ice cream! and travel essentials. Couple of small supermarkets nearby and a few eating places but not really busy. As a solo traveller felt safe walking there at night. Walking distance to Spitalfields market and the Tower of London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:31:00.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
