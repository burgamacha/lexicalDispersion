Every staff member was AMAZING!!! Communicating with the staff here is super easy, & their response time is incredibly fast!!! The breakfast was great & their spa area is great!! My friend & chose the Artemide Hotel Special massage (i'm not sure of the exact name but it's their own massage) & it was PHENOMENAL!! The women that gave us our massages had very soft, yet very strong hands! Just a heads up though: every part of your body will very likely be exposed during this massage (i didn't mind that at all). it is such a thorough massage! my friend never had a full body massage before, but i have, & i don't think that any other full body massage will ever top that one! the Hotel is close to everythingg, & the staff is soo helpful when it comes to anything! they're always willing to help you in any way they can (they even call taxi services directly for us), & they're very fast at it! room service was great, & i loved that when our room would get restocked, the maid would organize our personal stuff a little, but not so much where you would worry about where your stuff went. the only downside was that we were never really sure when our room would be getting cleaned or how long it would take, but it really wasn't too much of a big deal. we would definitely go back!!!! & we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to everyone visiting rome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:27:31.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
