The check in process was very easy, I was given 2 keys for my room. Unfortunately, they only had one room with 2 double beds and it was a handicap room so there was no bath tub in the bathroom, which was fine, but just not what I signed up for. The checkout process is also very easy, with a single click. The room itself was very clean, tidy and spacious. The mattress was a little too soft and the beds were really small, but I guess the description said double beds and thats what we got. The conference rooms, staff and service was really good, completely satisfied with all their arrangements and hospitality. Its a great location for having company conferences. The Atrium area is very nicely decorated with ample charging points and good wifi. Food was very good too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:22:11.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
