It's an older building, but everything is updated but it has an old vaudeville feel to it. We stayed in room 703, it's a deluxe suite with two queen beds and a pullout sofa bed, which was in a separate living room area of our suite. The room was VERY BIG...HUGE for NYC standards! the bathroom was updated and big too. The only issue is that the thermostat was locked. We couldn't lower the temp which kept going up. The hotels maintenance guy came up and tried to reset it, but it still didn't work. He ended up shutting it off (taking a breaker out of the thermostat) since the room was almost at 80 degrees, we opened the window (it only opens slightly) since it was 25 degrees outside, we ended up going out to dinner and a show and when we came back the room had cooled off nicely. The price is great, considering its NYC and around the block from the Empire State Building.\nFYI - they have valet parking: $45 for sedans, $55 for SUV's for a 24-hr period. The elevator is very slow in the hotel, we went faster to go up 80 floors in the Empire State Building than it took to go up 7 floors here.\nIf you are thinking about staying in NYC, I'd definitely consider this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:27:57.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
