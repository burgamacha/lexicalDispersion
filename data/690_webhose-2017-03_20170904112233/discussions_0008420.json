Staff was very nice and helpfull all the time and everywhere. This hotel is very well maintained, absolutely clean and spotless. Breakfast is very good and had lots of options. Location is great, Holborn tube station isn't far away and there is bus stops almost at the hotel door.\nWe had our room facing to the street at the first floor. The traffic noise was quite loud at the afternoons, lots of police vehicles / ambulances with their sirens on. Afternoon naps were therefore impossible, but at night it was better.\nPersonally I hate feather pillows, and of course this hotel had them. I should have taken my own pillow with me...\nRoom Tip: If possible, don't choose first floor facing to the street See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:05:21.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
