Our room was great!.\nWe had a direct view of the Arc de Triomphe and a panoramic view of Paris. It was priceless.\nThe room was clean and spacious with modern amenities, TV, mini bar, free internet.\nWe ordered in room the food was cold and did not taste great, the hotel made up for it but I will be hesitant to recommend the food.\nOverall a great stay and will definitely be back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:53:45.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
