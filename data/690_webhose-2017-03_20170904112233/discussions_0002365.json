We stayed for nearly a week in Paris at the Champerret.\nLocation: conveniently located about .9 miles from Arc De Triomphe. You can catch all modes of tour buses from this location. We use the Big Bus each time, but the other companies are there as well. Taxis pass on Villiers Avenue throughout the day and evening. There is a McDonalds a block away, a small grocery store a couple blocks, and many cafes. Although there is a lot to offer in the neighborhood, the location itself is quiet and cozy.\nCleanliness: very clean. No complaints.\nStaff: very nice and friendly. Helpful. Our tv was not working and they moved us quickly with no hassles.\nRooms: small-ish. The shower in our room was really small. The rooms are really clean and well designed except for the small shower, but the shower does not make it a bad place.\nI highly-recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:31:31.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
