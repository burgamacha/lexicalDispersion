It is very conveniently located in the central downtown and close to most restaurants, Metro, shopping, fashion stores and tourist sites. Right by the Church of Madeleine if you need a landmark. We were on 1st floor and yes it is noisy if you open the windows, but it helps to get some air in the room as we found the room rather dry/hot. Hotel d√©cor is quaint and artsy. Breakfast is a lovely selection of pastries and stuff-continental style for 20 Euro + add on as you order. But you can just as easily buy pastries and fruits and have a fab breakfast for less.\nFor myself, I have back problems and the soft beds did not help my back but with lots of stretching and walking it was manageable. I would recommend the hotel and if you have back problems inquire about firm mattress.\nRoom Tip: We stayed in room 104 -it was spacious. We were upgraded to 7th floor -but the room was a tad snug.
