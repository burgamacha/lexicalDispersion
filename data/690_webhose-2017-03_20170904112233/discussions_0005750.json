The lobby was busy when we arrived. When it was my turn to check in I was greeted by Merrick with a smile and a welcome to Marriott. He explained breakfast location and time. Internet password. Just a great experience. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was typical, eggs, sausage, fruit, waffles. The coffee was good and worth a second cup. I booked direct on line and the price was $17.00 better than I found on travel sites. I will stay there again\nRoom Tip: Our room faced 39th. not much of a view but quiet little traffic compared to facing 6th Ave See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:50:26.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
