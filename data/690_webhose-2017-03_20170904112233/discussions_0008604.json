Five minutes away from Waterloo Station with good mainline and underground transport links, five minutes from tourist attractions such as the London Eye and London Aquarium with the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben a ten minute walk away as well. we were visiting the Old Vic Theatre which again is less than ten minutes away. Also close to the Old Vic are some very good restaurants- we ate at Olivelli's which was good value and great food- but if eating pre theatre you must book ahead. The hotel itself is safe and secure- bed and room were great, and considering the busy road outside- you just would not know it was there! Breakfast was not great, particularly the fried portion of it and I would suggest that you step outside for breakfast- All Bar One is close by and just across the road near the London Eye- they serve a variety of breakfasts and appear good value. However the overall stay was very good and I think that Premier Inn offer very good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:14:04.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
