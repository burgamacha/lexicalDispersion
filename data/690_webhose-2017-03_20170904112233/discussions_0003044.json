But the theater is there and since we go to lots of theater we stay in that area sometimes. If you are looking for a good option in Times Square, this is a winner. I would call this a \"boutique\" hotel but it is not a small version of a boutique hotel-- it has lots of great facilities. Rooms are very nice and very well appointed. Restaurant at lobby level offers three meals daily and the food and service there is really good. Rooftop bar is amazing (54th floor) with spectacular views of Times Square and the city. Very nice fitness center on 4th floor. Highly attentive staff. As one of the newer Hyatt properties in the city, this one is beautiful and clean. Big plus are the great views from guest rooms. You are in Times Square, you have great views of it but you are so high above that you don't hear all the noise. Try to get a high floor-- great hotel choice in this part of town.\nRoom Tip: High floor-- will have great views and no noise.
