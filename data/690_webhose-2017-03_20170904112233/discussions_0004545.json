Not to everyones taste but we loved it. Mirror on the roof, electric toilet. Our room was small but comfortable and had no view but for the price we paid it didn't matter. Still really good value. The location is excellent right next to le arc and there is bus stop a minutes walk away where you can get on the sightseeing bus and see all of the sights of Paris.\nIt was my 30th birthday trip and the hotel arranged fizz and macaroons for our room which was a lovely touch. I would stay again for sure.\nRoom Tip: pay extra for a view See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:38:32.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
