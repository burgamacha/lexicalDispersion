If you are on a budget it's an option but there are more central options at similar prices if you book ahead.\nOn the positive side it's everything you need from a good budget overnight stay. Everything looks new and clean, staff were welcoming, rooms are quite and comfortable, breakfast was more than adequate.\nI can't give it 5 stars because the location is where it is, but it's a good option if you are on business at the shows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:47:09.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
