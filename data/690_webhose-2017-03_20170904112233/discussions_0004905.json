Beautiful hotel and we found a great deal on voyagepriv√©. The breakfast buffet was great and came with everything you could imagine.\nThe room was stunning - a large bed and the room's balcony had a fantastic view of the Arc de Triumphe.\nStaff were accommodating and friendly.\nGreat location within walking distance of most. Also, the hotel is outside a small metro entrance which connects to most lines.\nEasy to get back to airports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:58:50.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
