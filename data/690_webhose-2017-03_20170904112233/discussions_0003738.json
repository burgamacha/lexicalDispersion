Comfortable, yes, luxurious even, but often lacking in character. Enter this Paris Hliton, a beautiful and lovingly restored 150-year old building, oozing charm and atmosphere.\nRooms (we chose the cheapest) are not large, but well-appointed and luminous. We were given the choice between a room overlooking the street or one at the back, and enjoyed waking up to the bustle of Paris after a peaceful night's sleep. Bathrooms are lovely, with good tolietries and heated floor.\nBreakfast was excellent, with lots of fresh fruit Bircher muesli, but also three sorts of pancakes. Service was swift and very friendly. Let me add that the location is very central; next to a (metro) station and you will understand that I can't wait to go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:15:47.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
