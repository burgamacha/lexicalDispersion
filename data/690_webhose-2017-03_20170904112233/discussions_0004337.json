The bathroom is wonderful, large, and well lit. The staff were friendly. This location is great! From CDG, just take the train to Port Royal and then walk towards Raspail- about 7-8 minutes. The hotel is just across the street! This neighborhood is wonderful, 10 minutes walk to great shopping like Zara. Restaurants, bistros, and even Starbucks just minutes away. I will come here again!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a family room, wonderful and spacious.
