My now fiancee said Yes!! We were welcomed so warmly on our arrival and the kindness continued throughout. We spent an evening around Piccadilly and had the choice of so many lovely restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The strawberries and champagne on returning to the room were hugely appreciated as too was the choice of breakfast!\nI really couldn't have asked for a better few days! Thank you so much again to all staff , they were all so kind and obviously 'briefed' for our arrival and my plan! Special mention to Patricia, Roberta and Kayleigh for making our break an ever-memorable one!\nIt is safe to say that my fiancee fell in love with the hotel and Mayfair itself and has already asked when we will be returning!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:02:51.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
