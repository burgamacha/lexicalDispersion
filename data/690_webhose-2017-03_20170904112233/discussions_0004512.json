Perfect starting point for exploring Manhattan. Near to plenty of shops, restaurants, bars and all the sightseeing locations. This also means, it is loud at night. The hotel furniture is quite luxurious. We felt comfortable.\nService/Rooms: The staff is great. Do not hesitate to ask them for advice on restaurants or everything else. The will help you with pleasure and they have good hints. They try to match with every expectation.\nThe room is clean, spacious and meets all the requirements you could have.The bed is comfortable and we sleep well. Only the windows are poorly insulated so you hear all the noiz from the streets and if it's cold outside, you need the heating which is loud too. This doesn't bother us as much as it may others.\nFood (Dinner): We strongly recommend a visit in the Nios Restaurant. It was fabulous! Between 5pm and 6pm there is free wine for all guests. That is really nice even if it's always the same wine.\nWe didn't had Breakfast in the Hotel, so we cannot say anything about that. Prices on the List in our room, were not too high and matches with the normal prices in NYC.\nPrice/Performace ratio: The price for our stay was fair and we absolutely recommend this hotel for a city trip on which you are looking also for a nice stay near the heart of New York City.\nRoom Tip: Try to get a room on the upper floors. Maybe they are not so loud See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:07:24.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
