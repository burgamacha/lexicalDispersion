And luggage was brought to our rooms as well.\nCheck in was easy and quick as well as check out.\nElevators are tight and I mean extremely small. The smallest I have come across for a 5 star hotel.\nRooms are comfortable and decorated nicely but are a little small for the price you pay. Bathrooms are good size but showers are in tubs and I hate that. Felt like I had to climb a mountain to get in and out of tub.\nService is 5 star and that's why I have rated them high.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:53:09.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
