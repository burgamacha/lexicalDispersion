There is also a bus stop right in front of the hotel, as well as a stop for \"Hop-On, Hop-Off Tour\" buses. Transportation is a breeze from this hotel. As for the hotel itself - the staff is pleasant and helpful, and the rooms are clean and well maintained. Bed is very comfortable and the room is spacious enough. There is a restaurant as well as a cocktail lounge on the premises. The room service food is very tasty and well presented. A short distance (1 minute walk) from the hotel there are several food options: The Victoria, Pret A Manger, The Shakespeare among others. The stay at this hotel is pleasant and enjoyable. Few words of advice: - Don't count on TV entertainment in this hotel. They have only about 5-6 working channels - no cable or movie channels - just news and British game channel of sorts. - Internet is an Open network with no security - so connect at your own risk. - If you have an airport transfer/car service or cab - you have to be quick getting picked up or dropped off, as the hotel doesn't have a private road or pull in area. You will be picked up and dropped off in front of the hotel at a bus lane. So if a bus is coming you better hurry up. Overall, this is a very nice hotel with good, clean accommodations and friendly staff. Definitively recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:55:01.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
