However I agreed immediately as I was told by the Front Office Manager a sick child needed the room.\nThey moved me to the Soho Hotel and I guess that's fine. Front Office Manager at Charlotte Street who had called me and asked me to move hotels assured he would follow up with me by email with offer of preferential room rate for a later stay.. never happened.. no email.. disappointing. I felt to me like I was bailing them out.. and once I agreed to move they felt the issue was resolved..ah well.. one lives and learns.\nAs for SH itself.. Perfect location, good bar etc. Only consistent downside for me is the restaurant where I have yet to have a great experience. The food and service not at the standard of the rest of the hotel. Breakfast in particular has been really unremarkable for me.\nBut don't mistake this for complaint.. really great hotel and always a pleasure to stay there.
