My only dissatisfaction is that the hotel did not provide any assistance when a passport was stolen from my room. I had left it, against my better judgement, under a pile of books on a table to flatten it after it had become bent during travel. When I returned to the room several hours later, the books were still in place, but the passport was gone! It demonstrates to me that someone was looking through my belongings to see if there was anything of value hiding. The hotel staff comforted my on \"losing\" my passport, but took no action to identify or discipline people who had been in the room during that day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:54.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
