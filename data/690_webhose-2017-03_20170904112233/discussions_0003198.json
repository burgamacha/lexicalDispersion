My room had a balcony.\n- A great breakfast, lots of choices and freshly squeezed orange juice.\n- A quiet corner with Apple computers to do some work or to read the mails.\n- A free water bottle in the room and more for sale for only 0.5 euro.\n- Friendly and helpful staff at the reception, for the cleaning of the room and in the breakfast room.\n- Excellently situated at 10 minutes walk from the Termini station and at 5 minutes walk from the metro entrance. Plenty of historical and touristical sites in the neighborhood. E.g. The Santa Maria Maggiore is at 5 minutes walk and worth the visit.\nIf I go back to Rome, this will be my hotel again !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:47:20.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
