When entering the foyer, our initial impression wasn't the best. The foyer is old, and a little messy. The staff where very friendly and helpful. It appears to be a family run business. We where taken up to our rooms and where very pleased to see the quality of the rooms which appear to be recently renovated. Very clean, polished floorboards throughout. He bathroom is very small, but does the job. The room heating is very good. Located near the metro underground which makes getting around the city easy. Probably the best value hotel we stayed at in Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:10:23.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
