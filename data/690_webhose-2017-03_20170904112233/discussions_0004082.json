They told me i was going to have an early check in and i didnt..but that was ok. We were able to check n at 2, as opposed to 3 which was better. the room was great..small, but thats nyc for you. the bathroom is lovely and the products are amazing the shower was good but you kind of needed a phd to turn it on. It was very loud. however, once we closed the window, it was as if we were in the burbs. it was soo quiet that we almost overslept. the bed was comfy. great hotel if you need one in midtown west.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:28:25.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
