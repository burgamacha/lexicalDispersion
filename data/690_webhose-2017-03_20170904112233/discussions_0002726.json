The views were stunning, from the Hudson River on one side to central park on the other, at night the lights looked fab. Clean room, very comfortable beds, great kitchenette area, however, we didn't use this. Expected a few more toiletries, perhaps shower cap etc., slightly disappointed there was only shampoo and body wash. Breakfast selection was very adequate and set us up for the day, very nice comfortable area. Bellboys and reception staff were extremely helpful, would I stay here again?
