In the heart of Covent Garden and Leicester Square you are near to all the best places in London.\nThe Asia d Cuba restaurant has excellent food with a nice vibe.\nThe rooms are very nice, modern, simple and I like that you can change the lighting colour to suit your mood! Wifi is very good and easy to join.\nI think the bar maybe lacks a bit of atmosphere but I prefer something with a view than just a room!\nBut over all I would highly recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:26:47.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
