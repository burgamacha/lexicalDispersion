It is a great hotel with great facilities. And the location is excellent. The hotel is right next to the London Eye, across the bridge from Big Ben and the UK House of Commons and Westminster Abbey. The hotel is also within a reasonable walking distance of Covent Garden and some of the London Theaters (25 minutes, a little over a mile). The Westminster subway/underground station is across the bridge and the Waterloo train station is a 10 minute walk.\nRoom Tip: If possible, upgrade to the River Thames view. It is around $40 GBP per night, but is worth it.
