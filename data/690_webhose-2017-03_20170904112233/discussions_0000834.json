We asked, and got an upgrade to a high floor room overlooking the bay, which was really nice. So overall the setting of hotel was nice. The bar/restaurant worked well for a couple of adhoc meals, one while we were waiting for the room to get ready. However, the room was not a bargain, and they really need to change the Happy Hours. The snacks are a joke and the drinks lame. I don't understand why they still do this. The Happy Hour should be at Motel 6. Either upgrade it to match the hotel price or drop it an lower the room price. Also there is nothing else around other than office buildings. One restaurant, Kincaids, looks good but we didn't eat there\nRoom Tip: Try for a room overlooking the bay See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:44:03.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
