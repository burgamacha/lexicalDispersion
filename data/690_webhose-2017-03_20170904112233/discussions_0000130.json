BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY. COOL LOCATION. LOVED THIS HOTEL!\nthis architecturally stunning and renovated to perfection property is staffed by the most welcoming, helpful, professional and friendly staff I have ever encountered. from the front door to 4 amazing concierges to cleaning staff and everyone in between. I was a midtown gal yet I cant wait to return to the beekman. the rooms are charming, comfortable, well appointed and and full of cool yet functional period pieces like the bar. the bathroom is great- a perfect and comfortable combo of retro and modern. and many perks that are often overlooked are found at the beekman like slippers, turn down service and chocolate. don't be surprised if you get a note from your housekeeper wishing you a pleasant night and letting you know staff is available if you need anything. and did I mention the courtesy lexus that can drop you off in the neighborhood? not to be missed is the most stunning atrium bar area that is one of a kind cool and comfy and you can even eat there. and I don't want to forget a highlight of my trip...AUGUSTINE IS PERFECTION. breakfast, brunch and dinner- fantastic menu, impeccable service, cool room and once again, wonderful staff. ENJOY, ENJOY!\nRoom Tip: i like windows and light so see if you can get a corner room.
