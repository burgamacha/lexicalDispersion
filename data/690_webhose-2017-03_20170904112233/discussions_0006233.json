Wonderful choice.\n- Location in Wangfujing is spot on for first-time visitors to Beijing, as it is a strategic base from which to explore the iconic city sites. It is also within 10 minutes of walking to many good restaurants and shopping malls. The Dengshikou metro station is hardly 350 m away\n- Reception was efficient. The lobby was comfortable to lounge in anyway. Security was maintained without glaringly being obvious. No chance of an errant chap ending up in the elevator to the guest rooms.\n- Concierge was tip top even when busy with a line of guests. Never failed to offer a brolly when it was drizzling lightly. Most helpful with directions\n- We were provided a club room by our company, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Very spacious well laid-out premise with privacy walls separating the bath and walk-in wardrobe from the bedroom proper, located in the uppermost two floors near the executive club lounge.\n- The lounge stood out; service was anticipatory and precise. Layout and design were pleasing with wide views of the city. We are grateful to the Thai manageress who ensured that our stay was enjoyable.\n- Room service was prompt and the responding staff, energetic. My late-night dining at unearthly hours was handled without any hint of graveyard-shift lethargy. Food was superb\nI would certainly come back to the Hilton Wangfujing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:39:43.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
