We did the whole tourist thing for 2 days and at the end of the night we had a lovely sleep. Can be noisey but only due to rude people who slam doors and batter about on stairs. Staff lovely, rooms quaint and clean with clean towels daily. Breakfast worth the money and they have cheese and wine tasting every night between 7pm and 9pm.\nA wee diamond in the centre of Paris. If we ever come back will definately stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:53:09.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
