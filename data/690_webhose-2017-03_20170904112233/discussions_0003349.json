Room got ready in few minutes and we were allocated a street view in top floor room.\nRoom is specious for a couple, neat and clean. This hotel is located in 10 minutes walking distance to metro station. That saves us lots of time and help us to visit most of the places in Paris in our two nights stay.\nAll team members are very friendly and always ensure we are happy with everything. They also suggest us where to go and what to do around.\nI would highly recommend to stay in this beautiful hotel in Paris and experience the true hospitality with their talented team members", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:56:47.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
