The Even was a pleasant surprise from checkin to checkout. Our room, though small, was clean and felt spacious. The bed may be the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom had a great walk-in shower. The staff could not have been more accomodating. Our two complaints were so tiny, I only mention them so TripAdvisor will know this review was not written by a bot. One: no hook in the bathroom: where to hang one's whatever? Two: the lighting was very uneven, either too much or too little. I have already enthusiastically recommended this hotel to anyone who would listen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:41:21.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
