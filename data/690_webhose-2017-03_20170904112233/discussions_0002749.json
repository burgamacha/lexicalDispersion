Why dont you also charge for hot water? On a positive note, the WI-FI coverage is super, even in the spa.\nMINIBAR WITH SENSORS\nThe minibar has automatic sensors that make you pay if you remove items for more than 30 sek. Totally a thing most three-star hotels wouldnt install.\nPAPER\nNewspaper delivered to the door every morning is super nice.\nICE\nAutomatically refill of icecubes in the room every day is a nice feature.\nELEVATOR SECURITY\nI noticed that the elevator wants a doorkey in order to stop at your exact floor. It is NOT enough that one person in the elevator has a key. A nice security-feature!\nNOT DIRECT VIEW\nWe paid extra for Central Park View. We got the view but please note that the Trump building stands between you and the park (see picture) This is conviently NOT shown in the hotel-pictures.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:01:17.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
