We have had the opportunity to travel the world and we have tried several different hotels in New York City. By far the Mandarin has the most luxurious rooms with the best views of Central Park and the city skyline. We booked through AMEX FHR and were treated very well! The staff was great and the spa was the best I've ever been to in all my travels and the restaurant Asiate was just delicious and had the most amazing views. We are extremely happy with our choice in NYC and we will definitely be back. We absolutely loved our stay.\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:05:11.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
