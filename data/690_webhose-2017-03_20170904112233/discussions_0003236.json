The location is great as it is a comfortable distance for walking to Times Square and the theaters. It is also right near the subway and bus terminal for more remote destinations. Our room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.But the best thing of all was the staff. We had wonderful interactions with everyone; and they all are willing to go the extra mile for their guests. I would recommend this hotel highly for anyone looking to travel to New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:44:40.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
