Less than a 5 minute walk away from the convention and in a nice residential area.\nHandy for food and local shops and easy to find.\nCheck in was quick and hassle free.\nWe were in room 12 which is on the ground floor at the front. It was a decent size for both of us and was clean. I think the whole place could do with some modernisation but on the whole no problems at all.\nWill look to use again if we return next year!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:43:54.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
