We opted for this hotel because it seemed modern and comfy, with good reviews, and a nice price. Still upon arrival we were pleasently impressed with the reception area, it looked fancier than we expected. The receptionist was extremely efficient and professional. All the staff did a great job during our stay, I would say they appear motivated and happy with their jobs and that is great for us guests as well. Breakfast was very good, a lot of sweets if you're into it! The room was great as well, tasteful decoration and brand new. The only downside was that we could clearly hear everything that happened in the other rooms - pretty nasty. Would stay again. Good location (only used the bus once, to reach the Vatican), and Rome is fenomenal!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:44:11.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
