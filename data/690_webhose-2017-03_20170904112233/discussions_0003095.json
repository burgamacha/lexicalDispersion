We chose a corner room facing Times Square and it was like a front row seat to all the lights and sounds of everything you expect from New York. Fabulous ! It did cost extra for selecting the room but it was worth every cent. Our sons got a regular room which unfortunately faced the back of the hotel with all the air conditioning units. They weren't impressed! The hotel was faultless. Very clean, everyone was pleasant and helpful, and the breakfasts were the best we have ever had. So much choice and the breakfast room faces Times Square. You really had to pinch yourself, Magical ! The hotel was in a great location, within easy reach of most of the sights. We wouldn't hesitate to book here again if we are lucky enough to go back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:59:17.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
