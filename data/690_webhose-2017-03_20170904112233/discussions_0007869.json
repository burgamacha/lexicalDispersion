The staff prepared our room earlier as we arrived before normal booking in times. All staff have assisted us with every enquiry in a very helpful manner. Out breakfast buffet has been so lovely every morning. The staff especially Gyurhitsa has welcomed us each morning with a very friendly and helpful manner. The food variety is one of the best we have seen.
