Hotel rooms were a little bit small for what I am used to, but smaller spaces is the standard in Europe. Breakfast included and even a cellphone with data so you can carry around and stay connected in Paris. The biggest highlight was their front desk associates, Morgane, Marie Salome and Amaya. They were AMAZING. They were extremely helpful and gentle, always trying to make my experience in Paris better by helping with recommendations, making reservations in local restaurants and giving advice for every single question I had about Paris. If I had to go to Paris again, I will definitely stay here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:22:38.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
