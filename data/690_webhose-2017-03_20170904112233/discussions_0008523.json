The rooms have everything you could need and if you need anything that's not there (iron) ring house keeping and within minutes it appears. Location is great with South Kensington underground literally 2 minutes walk away.\nHowever, certain staff really need to brush up on customer service. It amazes me why you would go into this industry if up you didn't enjoy it. The service in the drawing room was exceptionally slow and certainly didn't come with a smile, you were served almost begrudgingly. That said not all staff were like that, we ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and the service was excellent as was reception staff/concierge. The breakfast was exceptional.\nIt might be just my thing but I love to visit hotels/restaurants and be greeted with a smile and someone who actually looks like they love their job, for me it makes a difference.\nI'd definitely stay here again and I would recommend it but don't expect too much from The Drawing Room service wise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:27:45.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
