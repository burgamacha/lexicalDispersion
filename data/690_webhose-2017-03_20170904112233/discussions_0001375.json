The breakfast room is on the top floor with brilliant views, but the breakfast was quite basic, only continental on offer and no facility to toast the bread. The room was very comfortable and warm, even though we were overlooking the road it was very quiet due to the shutters on the windows, there was no traffic sound. Bathroom was o.k. needed a new bath and grouting for the tiles. The safe in the room didn't work but they very kindly allowed us to use a safe in the office, the reception staff were brilliant and very helpful", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:58:14.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
