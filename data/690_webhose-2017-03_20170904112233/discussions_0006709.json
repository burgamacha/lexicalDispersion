Very professional and friendly staff. The housekeeping was really great and came in every day to make up the bed and clean up way more than I expected.\nThe rooms are small and when they say double bed, be aware they mean 2 twin beds pushed together. However, their rooms are still larger than most Paris hotels. I loved the decor! It was also kinda cool to see the sliding doors to the bathroom (which had an amazing tub btw).\nLoved that they had fresh OJ and Grapefruit juice every morning, an espresso maker and fresh croissants. It felt like what it would be like to live in Paris--except with excellent service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:17:39.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
