The rooms were well appointed and clean. Staff were friendly, helpful and polite. This hotel is all about its location. The wife loved the fact that if she fell out of the entrance she landed in the Gucci shop! The roof top terrace is an island of peace, glorious in the sunshine.\nCons\nNot many to be honest. It's quite a compact hotel, blink and you will miss the entrance. We only stayed a couple of days. The rooms are a touch too small, I like big airy rooms with views.\nI would definitely stay again, simply can't be beaten for its location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:19:43.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
