We loved the hotel! The staff is outstanding - everyone from the doorman, concierge, reception people, waitstaff... scored an A+ for superb service and lovely, friendly demeanors. We felt so welcomed each time we returned to the hotel and we were greeted by at least 4 people : )\nOur room was large, I think it was an executive double, and the bathroom was really first class, spacious and well appointed. We had the buffet breakfast at the hotel each morning which was good, but... perhaps some smoked fish would be nice?\nThe location of the hotel absolutely can't be beat - we couldn't have chosen better!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:02:12.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
