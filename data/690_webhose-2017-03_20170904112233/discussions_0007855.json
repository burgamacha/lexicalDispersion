Great location, great service, very spacious and modern room which we appreciated at the end of long days of sightseeing in Paris. Fantastic space for a family of 3. Only negative was that we could hear a lot of street noise at night, but this is not uncommon for anywhere you stay in central Paris. Would happily stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:38:48.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
