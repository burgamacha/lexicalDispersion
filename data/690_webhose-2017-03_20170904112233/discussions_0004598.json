Rooms are also quite big for Parisian standard, functional and well curated.\nEven if is above the underground ( which by the way makes the location central and strategical) the noises and vibes didn't bother me or disturb my sleep.\nGreat discover, i will surely come back!\nRoom Tip: get upper floor and if possible rooms facing the narrow street behind main entrance!
