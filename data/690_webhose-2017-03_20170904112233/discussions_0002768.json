Only stayed one night but the rooms served its purpose very well. Yes the rooms are smaller, between the bed, small desk, and side tables theres not much space in the room, but hey its midtown. There was a little hallway into the room that makes it seem quite a bit bigger than your typical NYC room, and the bathroom was very nice- none of that shower/tub nonsense, it had a lovely stand up tiled shower. And of course- LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Everything cliche in NYC is walkable, but the hotel is off on a quiet side street, so you can barely hear the city at night. Best of both worlds.\nAbove all, the staff were so kind and courteous. They made sure check in was a breeze and made friendly conversation any time we were waiting in the lobby. Overall a great experience.\nRoom Tip: Ask for room at the front of hotel- they have the best view!
