This was my third time to London and The Ampersand was our favorite hotel and we will definitely stay there again. We had a one bedroom with a separate living room that had a little kitchenette and small balcony. Breakfast, tea time, the pastries were all so good. The location is GREAT and only a two minute walk to the tube station. There was even a ping pong table that we were able to use in the evenings. All of the staff members were very friendly and accommodating. I would not hesitate recommending this hotel for a stay in London.\nRoom Tip: Loved the one bedroom suite with the balcony and kitchenette.
