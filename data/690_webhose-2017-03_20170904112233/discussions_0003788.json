This little hotel was in a good location for Montmartre and a metro ride/walk away from all the main attractions. We really liked how bright, airy and cheerful it was - the staff were all fantastic. Breakfast was ok - could've been better - and the cleanliness of the bathroom wasn't the best, but for a weekend it was great! All in all I'd stay at Astoria hotels again if I came to Paris for a short break - it wasn't expensive and I felt it reflected good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:16:33.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
