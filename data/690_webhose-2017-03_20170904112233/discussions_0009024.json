No room to swing a cat but cosy, well equipped, TV with digital channels and great bathroom. All going very well until breakfast. Tiny room compared to amount of guests, hardly any choice for example no bacon, sausages etc.. Wife had beans and egg and it was cold. Still gave 4 stars as the check in was so good and room so comfy. There is a cafe across the road so all good in the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:27:07.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
