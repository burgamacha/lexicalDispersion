Location, staff, decor... EVERYTHING was perfect from the moment of checkin to checkout. I took my boyfriend to NY for his bday, this was the best location for walking the streets. We had a high floor corner king and it was SPECTACULAR!!! the view was incredible! I wish we could have stayed longer. Will definitely come back again!! Thank you Rivington Staff you were awesome!!! Special props to the guy who checked us in, i think his name was Kenny, he was sooo nice and such a pleasure to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:15:34.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
