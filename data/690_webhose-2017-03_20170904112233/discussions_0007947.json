We booked 15 minutes before we checked in and the hotel was great! Check-in was a breeze, and the room was ready VERY early (10AM).\nThe room was very interesting - like 1970's hipster meets modern art. It's hard to describe, but we really enjoyed it. The hidden bar was great too. Have fun trying to find it in the lobby!\nThe service was decent, though we only really interacted with the staff at check-in, but they were friendly, welcoming and answered some of our questions. The Hotel is in a great location, beside the National Portrait Gallery and a few theaters. It's also very close to one of our favorite restaurants, Dishoom.\nThe bed was comfy, the bathroom was a decent size, the showerhead was good, and the bed had USB ports right next to the headboard, which was welcome as well. For the price paid, we definitely enjoyed our stay! It was certainly a unique hotel. I'm on the fence as to whether we would return; the rooms were a bit on the small side, and almost claustrophobicly so We almost struggled to find room for our 3 bags.. But I would certainly consider it because everything else was great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:26:21.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
