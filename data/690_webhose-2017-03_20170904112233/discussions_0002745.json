Location is great, right on Union Square, the building is a beautiful old NYC style beauty which has been done up in a modern but, appropriate for the style, way. The room I had was about level 7 and had fantastic views of the square, was huge with double height ceilings and a comfortable bed, was clean and well appointed. Service was excellent and the bar and restaurant on the ground floor were a great place to hang out, meet friends, grab a bar meal and have a tap beer. Overall one of the best hotels I have stayed in and cant fault it in any way\nRoom Tip: Any room facing Union Square See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:39:06.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
