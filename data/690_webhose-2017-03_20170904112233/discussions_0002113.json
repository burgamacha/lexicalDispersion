Everything inside is like brand new, absolutely clean and taken care of. Nice modern decoration.\nIt is well located, yet in a calm street with few to nothing traffic noise. Double windows climalit anyway to keep the noises out.\nSituated near to RER and Metros station. Walking distance to Opera, Louvre, Rivoli etc.\nThe bed was excellent, with 3 huge pillows, super comfy mattress and everything in perfect conditions. So was the ground, bathroom 100% clean, no mould, as if it has been built 2 days ago.\nRooms have air con, heat, free wifi, kettle with teas and coffees, mini bar to store beverages. Breakfast is ok, nothing crazy.\nStaff is very polite and friendly, reception opened 24h.\nI recommend it 100%, it's hard to be disappointed by such a nice hotel in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:43:27.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
