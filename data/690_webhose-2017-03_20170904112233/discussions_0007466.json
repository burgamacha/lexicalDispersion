Decent continental breakfast but if you stay more than three days it can get a little boring eating the same thing every morning. You can find a lot of restaurants and supermarkets nearby and the hotel is very close to Bayswater and Queensway subway stations. Even though it is a very quiet neighborhood you can hear some cars passing by early in the morning, so if you need absolute quite you should ask for a room that is not facing the street.\nOverall it was a nice stay and i will definitely book again.\nRoom Tip: Choose higher rooms and preferably not facing the street.
