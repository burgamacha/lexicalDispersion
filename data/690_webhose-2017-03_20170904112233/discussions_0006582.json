The hotel has many good points and some minuses as well. First the downside. Rooms are very small. As in really really small. My room needed a fresh coat of paint as there were skid marks across some of the walls. The bathroom, glass, shower door had a large crack in it. The mattress was way too soft. I think the interior decor of the common areas and the rooms themselves need to be updated. The common areas are particularly dark.\nOn the plus side, the location is ideal for shopping, eating, Central Park, and the Lincoln Center. The staff was friendly and well trained. The concierge was most helpful in giving us advice on how to get around. While small, the rooms were clean and the cleaning staff was friendly and helpful. A real plus is the hard wood floors. We chose a package that included a continental breakfast, which was not a bad value considering New York prices. In fact, the restaurant in the hotel, Serafina, was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever eaten, but the quantity of food was impressive for the price paid, and the service was good.\nAll in all this hotel is more like a 3.5, than a 4. It was not well appointed enough to be on that scale. However, it's selling points are its convenience, staff and overall good value. If you are looking for a weekend in NYC and need access to the upper west side, you should consider this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:16:00.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
