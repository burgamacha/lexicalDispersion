It's just a short walk to the park, 5th ave, times square, museums, transit, etc. The staff are also so helpful and kind from the front desk to the concierge to the bellman. I was not a fan of the shower (with no door) and did not care for the soap line either from the smell to the texture. The coffee maker was not easy to operate either... especially at 5am when you are groggy. We had a small issue with the door in our room and they took care of it in a split second. All in all, it was a pleasant stay and we also enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:24:06.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
