Booked a classic double but on arrival we were pleased to be informed we had been upgraded to a superior room. The room was really comfortable, modern and clean. We had breakfast included in our package which was very enjoyable. The hotel's location was great, down a pretty, quiet street 2 mins from the main tourist area. We walked to all major sites as we prefer walking to using the metro. The metro stop however was very nearby as was the RER station we used to get to the airport (about a 5 min walk). All the staff we helpful and polite. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again if visiting Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:20:59.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
