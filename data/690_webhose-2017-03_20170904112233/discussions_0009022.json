Its bang in the centre of Soho and is the most dramatic hotel I have ever stayed in. The artworks and installations are an assault on the senses. From the incredible clock by the lift designed by 'We are Human1982' of Stockholm to the quirky posters. pictures and paraphernalia all over the place, you are in for a visual treat. The rooms are exquisite. The food delicious. The staff outstanding. All with prics to match. But hey... this is more of an experience, rather than a hotel stay. Give it a go... and time how long that clock mesmerizes you.\nRoom Tip: I don't think they do 'bad' rooms.
