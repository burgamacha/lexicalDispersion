Every night there were cookies waiting after a long day of sightseeing and even a bottle of wine. The staff was friendly and helpful, they taught us how to use the subway and mapped everything out for us very clearly. Also, there is a great restaurant and bar, very intimate setting with a gorgeous fireplace, would highly recommend. We were very pleased with everything and would most definitely recommend it to others!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:47:27.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
