The location is perfect, walking distance to Central Park and Times Square and with great tube links at the end of the street. Our room was spotless and cleaned every day, we had expected it to be small as most hotel rooms in New York are but the space was very well laid out. Loved the decor and feel of the hotel too. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly enough. Only downside was that there could sometimes be a bit of a wait for the lift and the taxes on check out. We would highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate staying here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:55:57.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
