The location on 42nd St. was perfect for our needs. We found it to have a stylish lobby (Note: you take an elevator to the 21st floor) with a comfortable bar/lounge area and an adjacent restaurant serving excellent breakfasts (only meal we ate). The staff were friendly and efficient. Our room was on the 41st St. side and offered a great view toward downtown. Very clean and comfortable. We ran into a problem checking in due to a special need request. The Director of Housekeeping, Mr. Shannon, was notified and took immediate steps to solve our problem. Well done David! Easy walking to many theaters, restaurants (from Five Guys to Tony's Di Napoli our favorite Italian place) and shops. A great value in a Times Square location. They offer all the necessary services for business and pleasure. Recommended.\nRoom Tip: Rooms facing 41st St. have the best view. Higher the better.
