It was fantastic, the overall experience was superb and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. We asked for directions and the best way to get to various prominent landmarks and the staff were only too happy to help and support.\nThe breakfast was great with plenty of food on offer. We had one evening meal in the hotel which was excellent cuisine. With lots a cocktails to choose from too !\nDefinitely recommend stopping here. Central location to walk or get the metro to anywhere in the city. We choose to walk as you see the amazing architecture all around you. Thank you !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:19:23.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
