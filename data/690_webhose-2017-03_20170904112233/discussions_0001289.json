Our room was of decent size, well-equipped with a safe & iron, clean, comfortable and had a great shower. The staff are friendly and helpful, although we asked the concierge for some different advice (restaurant recommendations, arranging an airport transfer & getting tickets to local events) and were basically directed towards the internet to sort for ourselves. Location is the big winner here - for the very reasonable price we paid for a 5 night stay, the hotel is a fantastic base for exploring Manhattan. Would recommend - good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:09:47.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
