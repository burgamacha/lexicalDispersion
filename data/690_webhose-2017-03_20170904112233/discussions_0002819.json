Especially located in crowed place and compare with huge group/ chain hotels such as Hilton, Marriott, Millennium and Sheraton such great competitor, I think Room mate Grace hotel is going above average in this area.\nI used to live in 45th street couple years so that I can say this place is tremendous beautiful and quite in side and out side, Irish pub and significant grocery stores around.\nTo buy waters, fruits, HOT foods/ buffet style but not really buffet 24/7. It is very charming!!!\nSecond, my wife and me, we stayed in EXECUTIVE room, such HUGE space, in NEW YORK CITY, we would say it is huge but not really big for out of NYC people.\nHowever, we have Nespresso machine with FREE capsules every day.\nStaff and any facilities are unquestionable so that no need to mentioned, you just come and you will know everything.\nI am not sure if the price is fair enough but I think it is very acceptable for me.\nRoom Tip: Unforgettable hotel in NYC See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:57:53.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
