We stayed there in the summer of 2016 and brought back many great memories of our excellent experience. The food is so good we almost never went anywhere else, concierge recommended the perfect Italian bistro when we finally did leave the property. Everyone from the bellman, to the maid, to the room, to the front desk staff and room service was better than we could expect. The location is central to many sites in central London as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:27:07.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
