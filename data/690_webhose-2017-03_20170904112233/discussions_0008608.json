We had booked through Virgin Atlantic the flights and hotel. When booking the hotel we researched it a lot and noticed quite a lot of bad reviews, I have no idea why!!! The hotel was brilliant! I had been to NYC before and the previous hotel I had stayed in was more expensive and so small. I was so surprised walking into the room, it was huge even though it was called a 'cozy room'. The hotel was old school NYC and really presented beautifully. The staff were lovely I really could not fault the hotel at all. It was in a brilliant location, only 2 blocks away from Times Square. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone, it's amazing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:27:43.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
