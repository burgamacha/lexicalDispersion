I was hesitant about booking a room with an Eiffel Tower view because I was worried I'd get there and hardly be able to see it but I wasn't disappointed. Our room was on the third floor and you couldn't see that much of the Eiffel Tower but it still made it feel really special. You could see it from the bed and at night seeing it lit up and the light going round was amazing.\nThe room was lovely, well decorated, a great size and nice and clean (and the rain shower is amazing!)\nThe staff at the front desk were all really friendly and helpful.\nWe didn't have breakfast at the hotel or use any facilities other than in our room so I can't comment on that but I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:56:11.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
