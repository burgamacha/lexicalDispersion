What a great choice.From the moment the taxi door was open by a smiling welcome face to our final greeting from Steve, the doorman, we felt very special and valued. Nothing was too much trouble.\nWe stayed in the very beautifully comfortable Kensington Palace suite with a lovely view over the gardens. We loved the thoughtful treats and excellent toiletries.\nThe breakfast was just amazing. Such a wonderful choice and very delicious too. Try the healthier options the combinations are so good. We ate in the restaurant and again it was excellent- especially the Wagu beef. Oh I forgot to mention the stunning cocktail bar with the best cocktails served by really fun barmen.\nI could go on about the perfect location,excellent service,beautiful building and interior etc but really you have to try this for yourself.\n'The Milestone' Thank you for giving us a very special memory to treasure xx", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:11:31.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
