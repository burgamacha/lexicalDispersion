On a special occasion, we went to the Bristol (one of the few that does not require a booking) and were absolutely delighted by the decor, the service and the delicious food. The \"Thé complet\" menu includes a hot beverage and a \"mountain\" of savory and sweet sandwiches, scones and pastries. I am a big fan of scones and they were served with excellent orange marmalade. We had a wonderful time out of the hustle and bustle of Rue Saint-Honoré. I highly recommend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:47:47.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
