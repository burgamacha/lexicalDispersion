We stayed for 3 nights. Staff were helpful, and accommodating. 2 minute walk to Saint Placide Metro and 3 minute walk to Rennes. There is a mini bar in each room with a selection of drinks and snacks. Popular high street shops surround the hotel, as well as a number of restaurants. We didn't eat in the hotel, as we were on the go from early morning, and just ate on the move. There are lovely local bakeries to grab a croissant on route to Metro. Rooms were air conditions and had ipod docks, tv, safe and hairdryer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:50:34.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
