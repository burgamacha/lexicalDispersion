The staff was both friendly and accommodating, especially Jason and Elvina The rooms were spacious with nice city views. They have a lobby bar, good drinks, nice bartender.\nThe on.y downside was the Prime restaurant, which is not owned by the hotel. When we arrived, the hostess was extremely rude and snippy. After we were seated, we waited over an hour to be served. However, they were serving people who arrived after us. When we finally got our meals, I could not eat mine as I had requested my steak well done and was served a piece of meat that was nearly raw. .I was not charged for it, but had a piece of bread and a few slices of potato for dinner, after travelling all day.\nWe would all go back to the Bentley as we enjoyed our stay. We would not eat at the Prime.\nRoom Tip: Request a room with a view of the Queensboro bridge.
