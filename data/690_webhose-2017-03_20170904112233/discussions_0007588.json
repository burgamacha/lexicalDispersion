The hotel is beautiful with a very rich history that is worth exploring. Everyone I came in contact with was extremely knowledgeable and willing to share. The art is also worth taking the time to learn about. The concierge provided a book on the hotel, the restoration, and the decoartion. It was a nice addition to the staff input. The room was spacious (especially for New York) with luxurious appointments. I truly do not have a bad thing to say about my stay.\nA special thank you to Joe in security who made sure the earrings I forgot in the room were returned to me quickly via fedex. Another show of great customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:53:46.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
