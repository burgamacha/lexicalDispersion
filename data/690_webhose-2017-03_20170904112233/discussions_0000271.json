The beach bar has stunning views over the lake plus it's just 10 minutes walk to a convenient shopping mall with a nice cafe and several places where you could exchange currency.\nEvening menu extensive with a range of cuisine, perfect for when you've had enough goat curry to last you a while.\nAll in all, fab, would definitely stay again.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T23:19:37.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
