The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and we were upgraded to a bigger room when we arrived which we were delighted with. The Room was large with a big comfy bed and the bathroom was perfect for a messy couple - plenty of room for all our bits and pieces! The decor was stylish and modern but we were most impressed with the breakfast which was included in the hotel price - we weren't expecting much but the restaurant at the side of the hotel was lovely and provided a wide range of hot and cold breakfast foods which were delicious and set us up for a day of walking about the city ! Can't recommend enough, would definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:26:48.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
