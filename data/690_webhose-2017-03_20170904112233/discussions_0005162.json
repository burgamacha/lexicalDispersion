Nice staff. We didn't have breakfast in and it would be a lovely touch if there was an opportunity to make a drink in the room. You can only get tea/coffee after 11 in the lounge. Metro stations either 1 minute or 5 minute walk depending which line you need. You can feel the metro in the hotel so the higher your room the better. Green space of old amphitheatre behind hotel. For the price, near Notre dame, on 6 nations match weekend , was good.\nRoom Tip: Higher you are less you will feel the metro See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:57:29.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
