Double beds were also available. The room isn't very big but it's OK and much better than other rooms in NY. The beds are comfortable with good linen The kitchen is very well equipped. You have much more than you actually need. There's a big fridge, a cooker and a microwave. The hotel serves breakfast- that is definitely something not usual in NY and for us, a great PLUS! Not only does it save you money but also time. I've read in some reviews that the breakfast served is not varied- well, it is not so. You can get hot drinks, juice, muffins, bagels, pudding, ham, cheese, sausages, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, whole fruit, diced fruit, yoghurt, cereal... well, that's much more than what I usually have at home! There's also a coffee bar with free coffee, tea and hot chocolate you can get any time of the day.\nThe staff of the hotel are really helpful and kind. We arrived three hours ahead of our arrival time and the room was ready for us. Again, not something you would find that easily. The concierge service was also helpful. Do use it! We were there during the past blizzard and many places were closed. The conceirge kindly checked which museums were open and got us tickets for some of them. It's always good to skip the ticket lines! He also checked on the availability for some Broadway shows.In this case we didn't get them through him as we could get them for a more convenient price in the official website of the show. The location is very good- that doesn't mean the surroundings are particularly pretty. By 'very good' I mean it's only four blocks away from Times Square, half a block from the subway and only a block away from the main entrance of Port Authority Terminal and from the 8th Ave where you can find a cab at any time of the day. A I said before, the area is not the most attractive in the city. However, it is safe. We would arrive late at night and never had a single problem, The only two negative points I would like to point out are that it only has three elevators for a 30-story high building and it can be quite difficult to get one in the mornings and that the AC in our room was rather noisy. Anyhow, after walking for 12 hours it would not affect our sleep at all!\nAll in all, a great place where to stay in NY for a very reasonable price.I would definetely stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:45:52.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
