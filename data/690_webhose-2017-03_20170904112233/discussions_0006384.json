If you're looking for luxury this hotel isn't for you. Plus points: 5 mins walk to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue shops, great little cafe downstairs, and delis close by, good size room. We asked for a view and got one of Central Park (top floor - 27). Being that high up meant it was fairly quiet too. Now for the down side. Heating was a little noisy at night, water pressure in bathrooms was dreadful and very difficult to regulate water temperature, rooms need updating (they have done some but ours wasn't). Having said all of that you only sleep in the room so give this place a go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:30:55.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
