The room that I was in was very nice and clean. I love being able to open the window to let in fresh air. The bed was firm and comfortable.\nThe actual room size is very small. It was kinda tight for 2 people. The bathroom is super small, and the shower is a tight squeeze. But overall I loved the hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip summer 2018.\nThe price of the breakfast and what's available needs to be looked at. Scrambled eggs, cut up small sausage links, potatoes, croissants, boiled eggs, cold cuts, coffee/ cappuccino machine, orange juice. The typical European breakfast.\nI loved the hotel, the area it's located, the staff, and its unique charm.\nThere's a lot some could see as negatives such as the small room and shower, the limited breakfast, the noise of traffic every morning, but to me it was home. Who does not love their own home. Holiday Inn Paris Elyse√©s is your home away from home. If you don't mint walking you can easily walk to the Arc de Triomphe, and the Louvre.\nThis hotel is a Gem!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:29:52.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
