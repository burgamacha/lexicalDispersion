This hotel is a little slice of heaven. From the moment we arrived and were greeted promptly and checked in early the customer service from the front desk team was 5 stars. When we got to our room, I was a little disappointed with our view on the 11th floor, as we paid a little extra for a \"sky view\". I asked the gentlemen at the front desk ( I wish I knew his name, he was so pleasant, maybe a manager has he wore a suit coat and v neck with a tie) if we could possibly have a higher floor. He didn't get annoyed and said absolutely, we would just have to wait until the room was ready! It goes a long a way when people accommodate you. They ALSO sent me the sweetest Birthday card, mini bottle of red wine and chocolates on my Birthday!! We will absolutely be going back here and recommend this hotel to all. It has a great location if you are looking to go up to Central Park or down to Greenwich Village. We walked 14 miles one day. Go explore!!\nRoom Tip: Sky View above 20th floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:38:23.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
