Never had that before and a great way for them to find out more about my needs. A great little touch.\nOn arrival I had a wonderful warm welcome. Really made to feel at home. My room was ready on the third floor at the back of the hotel with an internal view.\nThe room was spacious, modern and well maintained with a great double bed with good quality bedding. Along with a separate sofa bed. Adequate storage too.\nSatellite TV, safe and free wifi. Tea and coffee making facility and a mini bar.\nGreat, if compact bathroom with toiletries and hair dryer. Only quibble was that the shower door leaked water to the floor of the bathroom but a well placed towel solved that.\nBreakfast was a buffet with a choice of fruit, cereals, pastries and breads. Plus freshly made coffee or tea and freshly squeezed juice. Yum.\nThe hotel is superb for central Paris. Really close to the department stores and Opera. Metro stations nearby and within walking distance of the non stop bus to Paris CDG airport.\nWould definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:43:30.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
