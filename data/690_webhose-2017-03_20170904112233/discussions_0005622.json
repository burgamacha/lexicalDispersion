First, this hotel is clean very new very well done. It's a vintage that looks like an Italian Yacht inside, not gaudy but very high end fixtures etc. it was quiet, extremely comfortable and the food was fabulous.

Second you will not find a better located hotel in Paris around the places you'll want to walk to!
