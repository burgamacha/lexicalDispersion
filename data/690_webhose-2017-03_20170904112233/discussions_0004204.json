A check in orientation map to the local area is provided which is very helpful. We had three people in a one bedroom apartment, which meant that the double bed in the lounge area had to be used, but this was easy to set up and fold down each time.\nAsked for a quiet room and this was provided, although our fellow guests on top of our apartment were VERY noisy at night, which disturbed some of the sleepers in our room. But this is apartment living.\nBathrooms were good, and water pressure was excellent. Kitchen was well appointed, and you could actually cook in it, which is not always the case.\nGreat tourist option if you need that extra space, and in a very good spot to see the sights. Easy access to the Metro and the excellent No.69 bus line, which is a great self guided tour across Paris (Pere Lachaise to the Eiffel Tower on one bus). Lots of good bistros and cafes around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:36:33.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
