On 'Restaurant Row\" so many, many choices of great restaurants. Service here was friendly, nice bathroom, but zero counter space which was very unusual for a hotel - pedestal sink. Hotel room used some valuable space for a cooktop and kitchenette sink and kitchen storage, but no kitchenware, weird and poor use of space. Would have been much nicer if there were a dresser or better space to unpack luggage. We were worried about noise, but room on floor 2 was very quiet, overall a good value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:58:04.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
