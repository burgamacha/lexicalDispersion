Gare Du Nord is also the EUROSTAR terminal so no changing on arrival or departure for UK London based visitors such as ourselves. The hotel itself is room & continental breakfast. Staff were very friendly, minor check-in time. Our room although small was clean, quiet, comfortable with modern bathroom/shower, hair-dryer, TV, strong WiFi signal. There is a lift/elevator. Would definitely stay there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:31:53.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
