The rooms are much larger than most other similarly-priced hotels in the area. Yes, the rooms are a little dated but it was $169/night right in the city. We were three blocks from Grand Central Station. There were plenty of restaurants and shops within one block which was very convenient. The only reason for the 4 stars is not having coffee makers in the room. The staff made coffee in the lobby, but if you got up too late it was all gone. Also, the fridge in the room was stuffed full of mini bar items, so you had to do some re-arranging to get your own food or beverages in it. Otherwise, a great choice for a short stay.\nNOW, if you are used to spiffy new suburban hotels that provide free breakfast and cater to whatever whim you have whilst staying as a guest, this hotel is not for you. But neither are any of the other hotels in NYC if you are looking for something affordable. Just sayin'....\nRoom Tip: The Tuscany Hotel us a sister property with a small gym that you can use.
