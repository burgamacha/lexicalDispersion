Sweet hotel. No interaction from staff, although we arrived at about 10pm after a long journey from London there was no warm welcome from the man on the desk, not even to ask about our journey. There was a problem with our room which he promptly blamed on the travel agent and subsequently the room with 2 queen beds which was booked was downsized to 2 singles. No tea and coffee in the room plus no free wi-fi only in the lobby. Apart from that the hotel is in a lovely neighbourhood close to the park and within walking distance of most things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:49:38.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
