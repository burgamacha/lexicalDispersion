Several subway stops nearby and close to main roads to get in and out of the city. There is parking nearby for much cheaper than the hotels parking (we paid $84 for 2 days instead of $120). The beds were comfortable, the room and bathroom were stylish and the tv was huge! It's NYC you aren't going to get a huge room but the layout and storage space was ample and well thought out. The front desk was pretty slammed almost all the time but they were friendly for how busy they always were. We checked in at 10:30 on a Friday and there were no luggage carts at that time. Lounge & breakfast on the 6th floor, though sadly didn't get a chance to try it. No ATM in the hotel but we went to a bar around the corner to get cash. The hotel was very clean, possibly the cleanest and most updated hotel I've stayed in in NYC. We will definitely be staying here next time we're in NYC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:39:26.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
