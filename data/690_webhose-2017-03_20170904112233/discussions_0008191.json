It was in easy walking distance from the tube & bus station. We caught the bus to Olympia but it could easily be walked (we have a 5 year old and we did not want to wear her out).\nThe staff/service excellent. The hotel receptionist (sorry don't know her name) went out of her way to make our daughter feel welcome. Thank you, you really made her visit special. All members of staff were friendly and always had a smile.\nRooms are a good size with very comfortable beds. You could easily stay in them for a couple of nights and have a decent nights sleep. As with other Holiday Inn Express hotels a good breakfast selection.\nWill definitely stay again when we visit London for business and leisure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:53:29.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
