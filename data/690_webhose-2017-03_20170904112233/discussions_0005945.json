It's still a Sheraton and it has got the class! We were here for about 6 nights and I never had a complaint. Kampala Sheraton is a delightful place to be. The location is perfect right in the thick of things, but in spite of that the environment is calm, serene and neat. The gardens are lush. The restaurants are great with great food, and personable staff. The rooms I stayed had wonderful views of the city and it was always dazzling to look out at Kampala at night. The ballroom and conference halls were adequate for the events held there. It even has it's own nightclub... All in all, I'll say vintage Sheraton service and class. I'll love to return again to Kampala and spend good time here.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:29:51.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
