One of our room keys stopped working but they replaced it straight away. We got a free upgrade to a king room which was a nice surprise.\nRoom: I think we stayed in 411 (top floor). It wasn't a bad view over the church across the road and it was quiet on the top floor. The air conditioning is quite loud but it didn't really bother me as some on here have commented. The room in general was clean and tidy and the bed was big and very comfortable. There were a few negatives though - the cups and glasses weren't very clean so I washed these before using them, and someone had the used the toilet and not flushed it which was a little unpleasant. The room was a little scuffed/worn in some places (carpets, furnishings, windows), but overall the room was good and we felt comfortable for the entire stay.\nThe shower was powerful and hot and the bathroom overall was clean and modern (though had a bizarrely uncomfortable toilet, which I don't think I have ever experienced!).\nOverall: Maybe there are a better hotels around for this price (we haven't stayed in a huge amount of London hotels so it's hard to know), but overall we liked the hotel and although it wasn't perfect as per the above, it wouldn't put me off staying again and is in an excellent location.\nRoom Tip: We enjoyed being on the top floor See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:42:21.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
