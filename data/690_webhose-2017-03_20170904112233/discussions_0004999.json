The hotel has great decor and furnishings. My only issue is that the door to the bathroom is glass. There is a curtain you can pull to block the view, but, if you're traveling with someone you don't know well, this might be awkward. The hotel is a short walk from the 9/11 Memorial Museum and is close to several subway lines so you can get to other neighborhoods quite easily. We were very impressed with the staff. Every single employee greeted us with a smile and a hello throughout our 3-night stay. I highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff and value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:11:45.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
