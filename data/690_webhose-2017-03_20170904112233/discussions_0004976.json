Our room was beautifully decorated and you could see the Eiffel Tower from the balcony. The staff were by far the most welcoming and hospitable people I have encountered at any hotel I've visited and really make it feel like they are providing you with more than a script or by the book service. They are very easy to talk to and make you feel as comfortable as possible. This is a perfect hotel for anyone looking for a break, from families to couples looking for a romantic getaway. This is the hotel for you. I think that four stars is unlucky for such a prestige hotel as it provides everything you need for a excellent stay. The staff go above and beyond to make their customers happy and I can whole heartedly say that I will definitely be visiting this hotel again. Thank you to all staff at Hotel Powers, you are a credit to your company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:46:14.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
