Upon arriving and being asked the reason for our visit, we were upgraded to a great two bedroom corner suite with living/dining room, fireplace (not working, but we did'nt expect it to), kitchenette and two bedrooms. The building seems to be an old apartment building, and they did a great job placing the rooms. I believe our room was the original format. The other couple that we were with had a great room as well.\nGreat building, location, art, bar and employees. Would definitely reccomend to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:00:15.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
