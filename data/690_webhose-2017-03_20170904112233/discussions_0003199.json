For Approximately $150 a night I had a lovely room with all the expected amenities. The location is excellent as you can walk to all of the great shopping in Wangfujing Street and you can easily walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. The hotel has several dining options or you can walk out the door to many more. I enjoyed the large East and West breakfast and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Beijing is a great value these days and I recommend this hotel if you would like to get a sense of Chinese luxury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:19:43.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
