The Bryant Park Hotel in New York City is an exception. From the crew on the front door to the security staff to the front desk to the concierge to the housekeepers to the maintenance man, they deliver service in a professional and unobtrusive fashion.\nA couple of examples - Stephenson on the front door - friendly, polite, professional and very funny. Maintenance - I mentioned to the Front Desk staff that there was a bulb out in the shower. Within 10 minutes it had been replaced. Robert the Concierge - went above and beyond in organizing our boarding passes and travel to La Guardia in time to catch our flight.\nIt's easy for a hotel to say that they deliver 'great service' but it takes a relentless drive to achieve it. The Bryant Park Hotel delivers.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room overlooking Bryant Square See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:08:04.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
