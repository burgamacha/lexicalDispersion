Wanted to be at the Eiffel Tower at night. This was the perfect place to stay. Right on the Metro. Room was tiny, but well laid out for a single person. Window overlooked a small, alley like courtyard from 6th floor (not really a view) . Honors bar in room and lobby. Breakfast available (for fee) in lower level. It's the only place I've stayed in Paris so I've nothing to compare it to but it fit the bill for my needs.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:27:05.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
