It does have a couple of lounges and bars and they were fun, but the menu selection was very limited.\nThe room was small, but well maintained and appointed, although there was no fridge. Housekeeping staff were very nice, and we had two issues with our room which were corrected immediately.\nIt's easy to get a cab from the hotel, and subway lines run north south as well.\nHope this is helpful!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:53:04.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
