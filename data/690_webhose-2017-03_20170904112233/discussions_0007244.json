We booked this particular hotel as it is an excellent setting, extremely close the tube station, and a stones throw from the Tower of London. There is a huge amount in walking distance and everything is easily accessible by tube. the staff were extremely polite and accommodating, we stayed in a superior double and the room was lovely, the bathroom was well appointed and had a bath and a walk in shower! Complimentary elemis products were also a hit! The only downside was the distinct lack of any view (a shame) and for the price I would have liked breakfast included. Having said that I would without a doubt return again. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:03:58.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
