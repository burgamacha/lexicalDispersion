This hotel was very nice, staff was friendly. We had a room for our family with a pull out bed. The room was a bit small (again, common in London), but it was very clean, and unlike other reviewers I did not smell any bad smells and there was no mold in the bathroom either. The A/C only works if you plug in your room key next to the door. No problem, just get an extra room key (or use any other old card that you don't need) and your room is cool when you come in at night (I'm sure the hotel doesn't like this, but we like to be comfortable after a long day of sightseeing). The room was a bit noisy on the Friday night because of people partying outside but it wasn't too bad. The breakfast isn't great but good enough to get you going in the morning. What do you expect for a free breakfast? We would stay here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:07:27.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
