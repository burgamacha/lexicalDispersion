We stayed in a king sized room on the 11th floor. The room was nice and clean with a huge bed. The room was a good size for a New York room with plenty of storage and a safe. I wouldn't be overly confident with the safe as it wasn't bolted to the wall!! The bathroom was also a good size for what we needed it for. Fresh towels every day. There was security in the lobby and it felt very safe. There is a lovely coffee shop in the lobby and a little shop, which was handy for water and snacks.\nWe had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was not good. I couldn't recommend anyone to eat there, the bagel I picked up was mouldy. Staff were very helpful and sorry when I pointed this out. The hotel location could not be better, a one minute walk will put you in the middle of time square.\nOverall I was very happy with the hotel and would certainly stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:04:55.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
