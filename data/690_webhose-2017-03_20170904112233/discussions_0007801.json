However, there were a couple of rough patches. The elevators were being updated so that only four were in service at any given time...and wait times for those elevators have always been a little more lengthy than necessary. One afternoon asked to have my room made up in the hour when I was out of the hotel and this was not done. And it seems that plaster or paint had been dripped in the bathtub and not cleaned up. Even so...the room was what I expected at an excellent rate. As always, the bar was superb...though my regular bartender, my dear friend Tony, was out with an injury. The other bartenders, though...Homero, Anthony and David...were superb, as always. All in all, it was a good stay and I will be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:24:45.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
