The staff are really nice and very eager to please. We did frequent the bar and did sample the fabulous cocktails, but they are on the pricy side. But then Paris is quite expensive for food and drink so you will need plenty of Euro's. This is not a refection on the hotel but I do want to advise travellers, we booked a private taxi through our booking this did not turn up at the airport, we ended up getting a normal taxi but there are a lot of unlicensed taxi's we were not aware of that operate out of CDG we were charged 110 euros we thought this was the normal rate, it isn't there is a flat rate of 55 so were ripped off, this didn't spoil out time away but bare this in mind. Like I said this has no reflection on the hotel at all. I would certainly come back and stay here again. The location is perfect and some really nice bistro's very close to the hotel, we didn't have breakfast at the hotel so cant comment on that, but there are plenty of places you can go to and sit and watch the world go by.\nRoom Tip: We stayed on the 9th floor very quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:44:38.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
