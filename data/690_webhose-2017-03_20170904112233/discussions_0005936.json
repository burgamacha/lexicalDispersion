I chose this hotel due to the proximity to Grand Central Terminal and Central Park.\nI had requested a high floor and they def delivered, putting me on the 28th floor which is the highest. It's so high that I had to take an elevator to the 27th floor and then switch to another elevator which only delivered guests between the 27th and 28th floors.\nThe room was an adequate size with a modern, yet small, bathroom. I found it comfortable enough.\nPros:\n- Comfortable Room\n- Free Bottled Water and Tea / Coffee in lobby area (there is no coffee machine in the room)\n- Smart TV for netflix and other tv streaming apps\nCons:\n- Check-in - there was one person managing the desk who seemed more interested in putting away the umbrellas painfully slow than helping me and other guests. Not what i'm used to when staying at Autograph Edition hotels.\n- The shower knob was crooked in my room (minor, but annoying)\n- Room was set to a cold temperature and took a while to heat up when i checked in", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:28:04.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
