Including the Pompidou, the Seine and Notra Dame. But there are many more. The staff are all very welcoming and chatty. The reception area is very well decorated and has a seating area. Lifts to all floors. We had a choice of room and went for one with a wet room. Rooms are basic with ensuite, plenty of hanging space and t.v. Drawbacks, no safe I room, no tea/coffee and can get noisy as doors have to be pulled closed. Our room had no view but do not know what kind of view you'd get in a small street. If your on a budget, it's worth a try.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:15:46.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
