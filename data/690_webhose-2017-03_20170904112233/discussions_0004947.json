The breakfast buffet each morning is good and can be supplemented by ordering eggs from the kitchen. The rooms are clean and the resort is quiet despite being located off a main road. Our room backed onto the golf course and was particularly quiet.\nOur one disappointment is that the pool was closed for maintenance during our stay (up and running on the day we left).\nHumura is centrally located and just a short ride by Ã¼ber to downtown Kampala.\nWe particularly enjoyed our servers Dennis and James who were particularly helpful and friendly.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:24:24.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
