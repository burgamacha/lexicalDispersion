Accommodation still excellent and staff training a delight to experience. Food was again of the best quality and well presented by a friendly staff. Special mention for our dinner waitress Stroma who excelled with her wit and charm allied to courteous service. A great venue for the family business which we had in Ilford although the replacement rail bus service was a bit of a bind. Will certainly be back here before too long. Well done everybody you are an excellent advertisement for the tourist industry!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:23:10.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
