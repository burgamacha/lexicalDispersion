Not only is Brian a fantastic Chef, but his porridge is absolutely the best in the Premier Inn chain.\nThe Manager Nicholas is by far the manager who has impressed me most. He is a credit to the organisation he currently represents. I am sure no matter his direction in life he will do well.\nI would have no hesitation in recommending The PremierInn at Brixton to anyone, which is a credit to Nicholas and all his staff, that do all they can to make every guest at Brixton feel more than welcome.\nTwo Very happy Guests.\nMr & Mrs Steele.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:44:27.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
