We never ate in the restaurant, so I cannot comment on that aspect.\nI agree with other commenters that the neighborhood is not the nicest, and perhaps I would not feel comfortable walking alone there at night, but with my husband, I never had any issues.\nOne piece of advice is to take your shower at night. The water was not very hot in the mornings because most people were showering then, but it was perfect at night!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:52:59.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
