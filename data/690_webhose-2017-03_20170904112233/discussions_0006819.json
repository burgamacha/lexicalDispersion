The rooms were bright, modern, and well equipped. Nothing was too much trouble for the very professional staff at all levels. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice. We only wished we could have stayed longer. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere and you feel very welcomed and an excellent location with so many trendy bars and shops close by.
