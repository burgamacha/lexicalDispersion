The hotel is in the corner of a very quiet square and in a lovely area.\nThe rooms are a little small, but are very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Amenities included free tea and coffee, shampoo,body lotion, hand soap, shower cap, hair dryer and iron with ironing board. There were plenty of towel and a heated bathroom rail to dry them (if needed). The AC was not great and I did open the window to let cool air in.\nThe staff were helpful and welcoming on the front desk and in the breakfast room. Breakfast options were a little limited: plenty of fresh fruit salad as well as oranges or apples, fruit juices, yoghurt, cereals, pastries (muffins and croissants) and cold meats and cheeses. Tea and coffee is served to you at the table as well as toast. A full English breakfast is available on request, but incurs a charge (I think it was Â£7).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:21:43.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
