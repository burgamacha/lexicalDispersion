Our main purpose in going was to see the Book of Mormon at it was super cold so we wanted something in midtown. Just a block off Time Square we were greeted by Andrew the Concierge when we walked in as the receptionist were occupied with other guests. He did not skip a beat welcoming us, and getting us checked in without having to wait on others. We were early but they let us store our bags and took our number to call us as soon as our room was ready. They recommended a great place for lunch and called us to let us know we could check in early within 30 minutes. Room was cozy and clean. Very modern. Upon check out they let us store our bags again, and recommended a place for brunch. Decor was really cool too. For midtown and a double room the rate was a great value. Sometimes service in NYC can be lacking, but these guys get it,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:13:51.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
