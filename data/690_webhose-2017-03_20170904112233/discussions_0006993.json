Fast Check in, accessible to Gloucester Tube station, Amenities are just opposite of the hotel. Everything are perfect except breakfast. I have been staying for 6 days and the spread in the breakfast buffet remained unchanged. Imagined I have been eating the same breakfast for 6 days.Honestly speaking, the buffet bread is good. I would suggest the kitchen would change some buffet spread every alternate day. This will be great. Attentive of the staff is excellent too. Upon our check out, the conceige staffs are even lending their hands to carry our heavy luggage to the airport transfer car. Thumb up for their initiative. I will recommend this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:49:30.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
