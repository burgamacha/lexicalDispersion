From the quick check-in by the friendly staff to the easily (and close-by) accessed elevators, to the short trip down the hallway to my room, I was happily relaxing in no time.

Just give me a clean room (check), a spacious room (check), and a room equipped with a mini-fridge (check), and I'm a happy traveler. I will DEFINITELY come back! :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:37:13.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
