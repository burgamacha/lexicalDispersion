I'm sure I couldn't have booked any place better! I loved everything about this hotel. It's an old building that's for sure, but they are taking such a great care of the hotel that you would look at everything with beauty.\nWe requested an upgraded suite with a balcony view to the road, which is definitly breathtaking as the sun comes up in the morning.\nThe hotel is located at what seemed a reputable street in Rome, with middle distance to everywhere. We went everywhere on foot, and enjoyed the walk back to the hotel every night.\nThe staff is very friendly and very helpful.\nThe breakfast is served in what is called the \"Sun Room\" which the best room of the hotel. Basic menu variety served with great coffee and an amazing view!\nWould definitely be going back when in Rome!\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with balcony and city view See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:20:55.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
