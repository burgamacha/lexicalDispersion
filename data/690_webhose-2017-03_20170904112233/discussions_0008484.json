Afternoon tea is simply brilliant, the hotel's own dining facilities and common areas are top-notch and very boutique in nature. Rooms, while a normal London-smallish, are rather comfortable and not-too-cramped. Sleeping was whisper quiet and cozy, we could adjust the room temperature ideally. Location was perfect to where we wanted to be in London's West End, a short ride to Harrod's and shopping, and mere walking distance to the South Kensington Underground. Staff was attentive and saw to every detail. What a wonderful boutique hotel, and we're already looking forward to our next stay when in London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:55:06.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
