We booked 2 fashion rooms and they were fine for our needs. Very clean, modern decor and large by European standards. The reception staff very helpful and very accommodating - on arrival we weren't happy with the location of our rooms and they were happy to show us a few to change.\nThe location of this hotel is excellent, right around the corner from the Forbidden City (actually as the end of the street) and 5 min walk to Wangfujing for great international shopping, as well as local shops and the famous food market which runs night and day. There are also some nice neighbourhood restaurants right opposite the hotel as well as convenience stores. All in all a lovely stay and lovely hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:02:30.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
