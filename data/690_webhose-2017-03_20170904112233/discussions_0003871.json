Hotel is located in heart of China Town, we wanted to see a bit more of The real New York and was also on a budget so this hotel seemed like a perfect choice. Check in was quick, hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 4th floor. Our room overlooked Manhattan bridge, it was a little on the small side but very clean and the large double bed was comfortable. There wasn't much storage space for our clothes but as we were only staying for four nights this wasn't really an issue. There is noise from the trains passing but not as bad as I thought it would be from some of the reviews on here. Take some ear plugs and if you are out all day exploring the city like we were you will be too tired to notice the trains and sleep well!! Shower was lovely with hot water when ever we needed it. Location is good, about a 7 minute walk to nearest subway station and a 15 minute ride to all the main tourist areas. Explore china town....there are some great restaurants, we loved our breakfast at the classic diner the cup and saucer on canal St and also exploring the shops along Mott St. If your on a budget and want to be away from the tourist areas then I would recommend you stay at hotel 91. Would stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:28:40.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
