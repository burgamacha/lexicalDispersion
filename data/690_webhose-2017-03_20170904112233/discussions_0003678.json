The location could not be better; all of Greenwich Village is spread out around you and most sites are a 10 minute walk or less. The hotel is on a quiet side street, right next to the New School University. Streets were safe and clean. The Walker Hotel itself was a delight; nicely decorated with a sunken lobby w/fireplace and an extremely classy bar and restaurant just a few steps down the hall. Breakfast was included with our room and it was superb--fresh-pressed juices such as carrot/orange/ginger...amazing. THe staff we interacted with including William, Josh, Adrianne and Brian went out of their way to be helpful but were also very professional and non-intrusive. We felt very comfortable with them. This is a romantic hideaway, mid-range in price but an excellent value. Not particularly a good site for families with small children, kind of an \"place for grown-ups\" but otherwise would recommend this hotel without reservations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:48:36.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
