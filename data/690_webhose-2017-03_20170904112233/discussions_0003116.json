If you want something a bit different from the usual 'one size fits all' hotel experience I can recommend this step back in time to the late 19th/early 20th century with its antique style furnishings and framed illustrations from Le Petit Journal. Breakfast was typically French, with fresh breads and decent coffee, the bathroom was small but everything worked, though I would have appreciated a hand grip on the wall near the bath as getting out of the shower wasn't easy. British visitors of a certain vintage may be irresistibly reminded, as we were, of the 'University Challenge' theme tune when they use the lift! With friendly, helpful staff, and a marvellous location in the heart of the Marais, surrounded by restaurants and bars and just a few minutes' walk from the Seine and Notre Dame in one direction and the Louvre in another, this is a gem of an hotel.
