The views are probably the best in Paris, the staff amazingly friendly and helpful. We had a suite of rooms on the fifth floor and could see the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour Eiffel from our double balcony. You are handy for the tour bus stops which are just across the Place CDG, the metro is close by and there are a number of restaurants and bistros too. You can walk to Trocadero and get the best views of the Tour Eiffel and to the Avenue des Champs Elysees if you want to shop. What more can I say other than if I was to return to Paris any time soon this would be the venue....oh and I got an engagement ring while I was there....and Champagne!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:43:36.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
