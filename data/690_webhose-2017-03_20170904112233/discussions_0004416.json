The location was excellent, the staff speaks perfect English, the free breakfast helped keep us energized for our days of exploration, and the rooms were small but very clean. In short, it was nice to not have to think about hotel issues during our trip. Seddik was particularly helpful in helping us see the important sites, as well as general advice about exploring the city and navigating the metro. The complimentary snack bar at night is nice after a day of wandering too. I will definitely stay at this hotel again (or another hotel in the Astotel chain).\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a sideways view of the Eiffel Tower See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:06:31.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
