The location is amazing, the facilities are also lovely- classic, but also impeccably clean and well looked after. But what always sells this place for me- the people! You meet so many great characters from guests and the staff. I recommend stopping by just for drinks in the Bar if nothing else. It's such a welcoming place. The Italian bar manager really looks after you, and the whole team are incredibly attentive. There is so much choice, but I really recommend their blush rose with dry strawberries. It's definitely worth spending a bit more than your local pub to sit in such comfort, with such good humour and company. They are the ultimate experience of what amazing 'service with a smile' should be :)\nRoom Tip: Blush rose wine and strawberries See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:20:36.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
