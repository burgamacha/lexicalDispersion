Quick search of available hotels pleasantly surprised me. The last time I was in NY was May 2007 and I remember being in shock from hotel prices :) This time there was 4 of us: 2+2 (4, 6 y.o.) plus 2 dogs who we were dog sitting for our friends hence last minute decision. We were limited with pet friendly hotels and Shelburne-Affinia came out on top for us for few reasons: pet friendly, only $50 pet fee and not per pet but in total, price, location. We were not disappointed and I can honestly say it was one of the best week ends for us. What we liked:\n- pet friendly, they gave us dog beds and bowls and pet door sign;\n- location, we just walked everywhere;\n- price, we booked on their own website as it worked out the cheapest;\n- nice room, we had a standard room with 2 double beds on the 3rd floor, it was on the small side but plenty big for all of us;\n- roof access, great views for free;\n- wine hour from 5-6, it was great to chill with a glass of lovely wine and atmosphere was lovely;\n- staff, very courteous and professional;\nThere was nothing we didn't like. In fact we are hoping to come back very soon, without dogs this time though. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location, price, pet friendly if you have pets but without pets you ll really enjoy it as well.\nWe booked valet parking across from the hotel for $25 for 24h through spothero app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:56:26.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
