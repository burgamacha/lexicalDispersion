The rooms are on the small size but you'll find everything you need, clean, good beds and if you are lucky you will be able to see the eiffeltower from your room. Good Wifi but somewhat thin walls. The breakfast assortment is rather small but what they have is of good quality. Sure, the famous lift is probably the smallest I've ever seen but on the other hand is one of the things that a put a smile on our face everytime we think of it...and it turned out to be no problem whatsoever.\nSo all in all, a great hotel at an excellent value. Still the best part is the neighborhood, located in a calm district, with a lot of shops (bakery, wine, cheese etc), cozy restaurants and friendly people. Within 5 minutes you can reach either the Eiffel tower, Les Invalides or the nearest metro station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:03:42.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
