The decor is stylish in the rooms and in the hotel lounge, and our stay was very comfortable. We also attended a conference and had breakfast and lunches at the hotel restaurant which is a Jamie's Italian, so the food was great too! Would recommend this hotel in the luxurious rooms. It also has a great location and is very near to the tube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:02:46.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
