The rooms are spacious with attractive updated furnishings. Bathrooms are also large with wonderful walk-in showers. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Tribeca, just a short walk to the Freedom Tower, the Oculus underground mall, and a slew of fine restaurants (one is attached to the hotel). A subway stop for different uptown trains is literally outside the hotel entrance. We have a son who lives in the area & have stayed at other hotels in Tribeca & SoHo over the years. The Smyth is definitely at the very top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:03:05.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
