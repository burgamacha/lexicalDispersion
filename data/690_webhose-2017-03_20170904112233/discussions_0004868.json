I honestly have nothing but amazing things to say. Check in was early and seamless. I'd asked for a room upgrade prior and I am not sure if I did but the room I'm in is fabulous!!!! 504 overlooking the Arc De Triomphe. I actually watched the Tour De France from my balcony. I had twin beds and they got put together and its massive and comfy. The sheets are crisp white, Bathroom brand new. The staff absolutely top this off. They are soooo lovely. The reception guy is amazing. A lot nicer than some of the other locals for sure!! So helpful and polite. The concierge, maids. All lovely. Really made me feel at home when I'm away from home missing my family during a business trip. Thank you all , sorry I don't know names. I'll definitely stay here again when in the area on business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:00:36.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
