Olga at reception was very helpful when we checked in, she informed us that there was an airport shuttle bus we could get for our return journey which got rid of the stress of getting to the airport via metro at 6am. The bus was great and I would thoroughly recommend it. Olga was also able to recommend some places to eat near the hotel. There are loads of restaurants within a 5 minute walk, we found one \"Le Cote D'azur\" which served brilliant french food, our first experience of snails which were delicious. The wine was very nice as well and at a great price.\nWith regard to the hotel we found our room clean and comfortable. The shower is amazing too. We had a room with a balcony which we felt was a nice touch.\nWe would highly recommend breakfast, its 10 euros per person & you can eat as much as you like. We found other areas in Paris very expensive.\nWould definitely recommend and hope to stay again in the future.\nDanny & Lucy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:58:37.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
