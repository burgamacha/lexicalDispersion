I had a issue with heating system, they fixed it very quickly. Don't take into account that there wasn't kettle in the room and in the evenings it was pleasure to have a tea or coffee, they gave me hot water without any problem. Thanks a lot to Fernandez (with Latin appearance ) and girl (unfortunately but I don't remember her name), both of them were very kind and polite. Room was small, compare with other hotels, but for me it was comfortable, just shower cabin was really too small.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:59:54.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
