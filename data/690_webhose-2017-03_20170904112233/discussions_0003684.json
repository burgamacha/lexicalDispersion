Even the smallest rooms feel cosy and the balcony feature in the larger rooms are a lovely touch. I would say that the front desk check in is always a little lacklustre in terms of energy and warmth no matter the time. However, the rooms, regardless of size, are always comfortable and well designed. The room is always well cleaned and presented. I love the beds, bedding and pillows there. They always feel fresh, soft and cocooning. The styling is beautiful and the lighting is well thought out. The sconces, overhead lighting and hallway lighting feel warm and boutique but it is convenient and designed so that you can switch them off at your bedside. The bathroom is well lit, beautifully designed with a well sized mirror and plenty of storage surface area. The showers are always hot with excellent water pressure. The small details in the bath mats and the Margiela robes are wonderful. I had water in my room on my first stay but not on the second but Housekeeping were quick to run some up to me. Housekeeping and Door staff at the entrance always seem friendly. Coffee is great in the room for a quick start to the day. The gym is small but has everything you need for a quick workout and the view is good. The roof terrace is a great feature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:14:05.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
