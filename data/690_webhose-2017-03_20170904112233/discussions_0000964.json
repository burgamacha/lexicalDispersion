I was initially hesitant about my stay in Paris, because Parisians have a reputation for being a bit unfriendly towards tourists, but my stay at Hotel La Tamise just made it so much more enjoyable (and I didn't spend much time in the hotel - goes to show what an amazing impression that can make with such little interaction). Besides Julien and Antonio, all other staff including the room service cleaning staff was extremely friendly, accommodating and helpful. Everyone went above and beyond to make my stay splendid - from city suggestions, to restaurant bookings and mail services. A small part of me wants to keep this gem all to myself for my return to Paris, but my amazing experience has to be shared and I will tell everyone I know! Please keep it up - it is inspiring to be surrounded by people passionate about their work and proud of their wonderful efforts!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:37:44.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
