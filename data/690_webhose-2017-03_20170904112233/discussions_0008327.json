It really did live up to the excellent reviews and although tucked away in a rather ordinary street, it is just minutes from shops, bars and restaurants. The staff here are amazing and nothing is too much trouble - they all have excellent English and customer care skills. The d√©cor is lovely. There is no restaurant at the hotel but they do offer breakfast which was excellent. Weather permitting, you can eat outside in the courtyard. There is an honesty bar and you can help yourself to drinks. We stayed as 3 friends so opted for a triple room which was really spacious and on the 5th floor - Room 501. The bathroom was stunning with a huge shower and lovely Hermes toiletries. We booked the spa but mixed up our days so did not get to experience it! This hotel truly deserves all the lovely comments made - book it today!\nRoom Tip: We were in Room 501 - and it was excellent!
