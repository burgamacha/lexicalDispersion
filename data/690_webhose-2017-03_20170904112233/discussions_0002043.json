We usually stay at a Hilton brand when we travel. The location is convenient to everything TS has to offer. The subway is literally right outside the entrance. Most of the restaurants nearby are chains. Walk a couple of blocks through the theatre district and you're in Hell's Kitchen - lots of great restaurants to choose from! The main lobby is on the 3rd floor. This is good because you don't have just anyone walking into the hotel. Guests have to show their room key cards to get through the ground floor lobby. Check in was fast and easy. As I took care of that a Hilton employee struck up a conversation with my husband. Uh oh, I thought...here we go! He asked if we had a free morning....I knew it! They wanted us to sit in on a presentation (Hilton's version of a timeshare....The Grand Vacation Club. We know...we are owners (ugh!...biggest mistake ever!). We told him nicely, no thank you....we are owners (his eyes lit up....thinking we want to upgrade....no, we want to unload the darn thing!). We also had every minute accounted for on this vacation. No time for the 60 min (in Hilton time = 3 hours) presentation (aka: hard sell sales pitch). He backed off - I was impressed! First. Time. Ever. We get hounded every time. Back to the hotel....it was clean and quiet. The decor was a little dated, but that's ok. We just needed a clean quiet place to lie our heads and shower. The housekeeping staff was very attentive and friendly. Free wifi for Honors members. Hilton just needs to chill with the Grand Vacation Club stuff...otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.\nRoom Tip: Avoid the Hilton Grand Vacation Club presentation...
