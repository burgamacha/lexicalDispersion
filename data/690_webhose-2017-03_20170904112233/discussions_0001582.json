The hotel appears to have been recently renovated and was very clean. I read the reviews in advance and was not at all disturbed by the narrow hallways or small elevator (the elevator is new, just small). The rooms were absolutely perfect for our needs: clean, neat, modern baths, etc. Our room did not have a \"view\" but that was A-OK with us, we had plenty of sightseeing elsewhere. The kids' room had a spiral staircase with 2 twin beds upstairs and a pull-out sofa bed on the first floor near the bathroom. The location was very close to the train station but we opted to walk most of the time (and taxi/Uber... which was convenient and not that expensive). We also had breakfast included and it was GREAT. The staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:56:23.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
