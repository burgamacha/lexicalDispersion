Penn station is a 5 min walk. The staff was very welcoming and kind. We were able to store our bags prior to our check-in and post check-out which was great. The greeters ask for your key prior to entering hotel to ensure you are staying here which is good to ensure safety. Breakfast was amazing, wifi connection great. The room was clean and no one disturbed us. Overall, great and affordable choice to stay at while in NYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:11:33.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
