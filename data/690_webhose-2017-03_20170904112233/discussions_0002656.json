It's great location offers a variety of things to do and see. Central park its just a few blocks away as well as shopping, dinning and catching the subway to get around town. The friendly and courteous staff is terrific and go all out to make your stay as relaxed and simple as possible. There really is no need in my opinion to pay for pricey 5 star hotels when The Belleclaire has so much to offer like family suites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:12:26.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
