I don't care for being in the middle of Times Square, and this location is just far enough north to make it a great- and quiet location. The all-suites rooms are one of the main reasons staying here is so lovely- New York hotel rooms are typically very small, so it is nice to stretch out a bit.\nThe rooms are beautiful- the beds are comfortable and the rooms are very quiet by NYC standards. My only complaint is the lack of in-room coffee. I expect hotels of this caliber to have a single-serve brewer or at least complimentary coffee in a main area.\nThis hotel is perfect for anyone needing a central location! I enjoyed waking up, grabbing coffee and strolling through Central Park. I also love how close it is to the Columbus Circle Whole Foods- so nice to grab healthy lunch/dinner items.\nThe location, space, staff and attention to detail make this hotel one of my top NYC recommendations!\nRoom Tip: Rooms on the north side above the 11th floor have a small Central Park view!
