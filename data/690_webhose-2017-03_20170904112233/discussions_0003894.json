My room was small but very well appointed. Very clean and really just lovely, Every night we went to the happy hour - which turned into dinner most nights. What was very fun is that the happy hour food varied but so did the alcohol. Some nights wine, some nights whiskey. This room also housed the wonderful morning breakfast. I stayed at this hotel for business but I will go back in the future for fun!\nRoom Tip: Stay on higher floors to decrease intercity noise.
