We got a really nice greeting upon entering the lobby and were quickly invited to use the second floor facilities for tea, coffee and evening wine and cheese .. a really nice touch.. Our room was ready when we arrived and was lovely. The hotel itself is situated in a great place close to Times Square with all of the NYC attractions in easy walking distance. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and would definitely use again if we return to New York..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:07:11.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
