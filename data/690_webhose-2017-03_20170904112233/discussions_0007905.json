The hotel is located in the heart of the Latin Quarter, near the subway station and walking distance to many tourist destinations. The staff were welcoming and made us feel special with their greeting, \"we've been expecting you.\" We asked for and thankfully received early check in after our international flight.\nThe rooms are small, but efficiently laid out. They are quiet with bright sunlight through the many windows. Furnishings are modern yet warm and most comfortable. Shower is excellent. Lounge where breakfast and afternoon refreshments are served is like a living room -- very comfortable and relaxing.\nBreakfast is divine, especially the regular and chocolate croissants. Wonderful coffee machine that makes an assortment of drinks. Nice \"honest bar\" for an afternoon retreat after a busy day in Paris. We would definitely stay here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T11:19:26.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
