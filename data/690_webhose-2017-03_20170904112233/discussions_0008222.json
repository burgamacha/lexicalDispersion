This really is made special by the amazing amazing staff! Keisha and Erica from the front desk went above and beyond, thank you so much for everything. They ensured that anything big or small was sorted for us. We also had a lovely waiter in the bar on Saturday night serving us and unfortunately can't remember his name and the lovely doormen.\nThe hotel vibe is very \"cool\" and homely with rustic styling. The bed is super comfortable and the food is great. The bar is very popular with locals as well as the hotel guests, it always has a great buzz. They always have a few tables reserved for hotel guests. Next time we are in NY the Bowery is going to be our go to hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:11:47.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
