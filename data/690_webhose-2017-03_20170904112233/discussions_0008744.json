Rydges provided all that we needed: it was clean, it was comfortable and it was one minute from Gloucester Road Tube Station on the Piccadilly Line. Brekkers was more than adequate, though a little expensive if it wasn't included in your bill. The only drawback we found was that, as we always sleep with the window wide open, South Kensington's background noises aren't conducive to a good night's sleep but that's our problem, not the hotel's. Some reviewers found the staff unfriendly or unhelpful, well all I can say is that those staff weren't on duty while we were there! Half the time you know, all they want is a friendly smile themselves!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:41:57.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
