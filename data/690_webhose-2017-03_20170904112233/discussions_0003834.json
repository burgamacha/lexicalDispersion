We stayed here for 5 nights last summer during our European tour and there is nothing I can fault the hotel with...other than perhaps some of the construction and beautifying that was going on at the time. However, no inconvenience at all.\nWe booked a terrace suite..the Eiffel tower view is to die for!\nThe suite is extremely generous in size for Paris, the terrace is large and the location of the hotel is great! It is located in an upscale arrondissement with easy access to transportation.\nBreakfast in the courtyard in the morning was just fantastic.\nBeds are sooo comfortable, the room was clean and the staff absolutely amazing.\nWe would definitely stay here again while in Paris!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:28.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
