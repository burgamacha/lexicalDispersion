Located in the middle of the shopping district and walking distance to the majority of the sights.\nRooms are very tastefully decorated and compact, containing everything you need including a Nespresso machine.\nNot much nightlife in the area but there is a metro station less than a minute away allowing you to easily explore other areas of the city and the helpful hotel staff will offer suggestions if you ask.\nIf I were to visit Paris again I would probably stay in Monmatra or Le Marais just because there is more going on in an evening and I wouldn't be as interested in the big tourist attractions. However I would highly recommend Hotel de Seze to anyone visiting Paris and wanting to see the sights.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a room high up and at the back to avoid traffic noise.
