There are loads of lovely shops, galleries and cafes right on the door step. The Marais is such a lovely area and the hotel was really easy to reach on the metro from the Gard de Nord. I went with my 16 year old daughter and she loved it as much a I did. The room was clean and cosy and, having walked miles around Paris during the day, it was perfect to be able to find a good brasserie for supper only 100 yards away. A great place to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:15:53.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
