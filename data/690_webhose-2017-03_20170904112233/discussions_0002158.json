After, I made some more stays. This time I wanted to see, how this hotel is doing now, and the location was perfect for my needs.\nThe soundproofing is now much better,I stayed in a second floor room overlooking the Opéra building, but the traffic or neighbors didn’t disturb me. I slept better than home.\nThe rooms are still different sizes. I had a classic room, which may seem small to someone, but the bed was big and the bathroom was spacious. However, you can have a bigger room or even a suite, if needed. It was still possible to have the breakfast served in the room, but you could also have it in the restaurant.\nHalf of the lobby was transformed to restaurant (The Bar), and I enjoyed my lunch there every day, under the glass roof. The food and service were very good.\nIn case you are a member of IHG, you have free WiFi for more than 3 days, and a newspaper delivered to your room every morning.\nThere was an iron and a board, a kettle, some instant coffee and tea bags and two spoons. There was also a fridge, and when I opened the door after I arrived, there was immediately a person wanting to check it, and therefore I left the fridge in peace. I had good reading lights both sides of the bed and a floor lamp next to the table. There were no small lights in the room during the night, but I had a small flashlight with me.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T21:26:01.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
