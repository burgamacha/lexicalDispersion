Hotel is close to the metro station (by metro you can go almost everywhere). I liked that the hotel keeps traditional look of big hutong house but combined with modern solutions (like nice bathroom and big, comfortable bed). Staff was very helpful. Day before check out they asked if we need taxi for airport (we didn't need but it was nice gesture). This hotel is really worth to recommend.\nThe breakfast could be served for a little bit longer (you only till 09:30 1h could be more). The location of the hotel was not easy to find for the first time, it could be better indicated from the main street.\nRoom Tip: ask for quiet room with own bathroom (should be always but in Beijing you never know) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:45:13.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
