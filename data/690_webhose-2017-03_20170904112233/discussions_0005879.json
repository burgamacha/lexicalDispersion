This was our first Roman trip and we found the proximity to the Colosseum an unexpected boon. Just walking distance to one of the most iconic places in the world!\nGood bus, taxi, tour bus connections are nearby.\nThe room was immaculate and well furnished (the view from the window was of an old street with ancient Roman architecture - not spectacular, but interesting enough. The beds were very comfortable.\nBreakfast was excellent - on the roof terrace - with a well-stocked buffet. The city view side was a bit dicey because of the gulls, but the other side was quiet and peaceful!\nThe staff couldn't have been more helpful.\nWe'll certainly take another look if we return to Rome. This was a great introduction to a truly memorable holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:54:10.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
