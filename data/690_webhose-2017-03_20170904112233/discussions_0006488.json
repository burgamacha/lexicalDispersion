We arrived to be greeted by lovely friendly staff with a warm reception area! We arrived very early 11.00am and our room was ready! Great start! We were shown to our studio and told if we needed any fresh towels etc to just ask. The studio was lovely and clean and had everything you needed for a nice comfortable stay. Directly across the road is bus stop for the open top original bus tours if your using them! 2 minutes walk round the corner from Trafalgar Square, 10 minute walk to the London eye, Westminster, convent garden etc. 10-15 min walk to Buckingham palace! Tesco express 2 minute walk. 5 minute to the Alba hotel where we went to the fawlty towers dining experience, which is also next to Charing Cross tube station.\nThank you very much to the citadines staff for a all round lovely experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:12:34.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
