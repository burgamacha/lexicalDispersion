I had been concerned about booking a Petit Queen room but it gave us adequate space and a small seating area. Fittings and fixtures were of nice quality; shower and pressure excellent! We were up on the 16th floor and found street noise to be minimal. Staff on the desk were friendly and helpful in helping me place a local call to look for something we had lost, recommending shows and places to eat; storing our luggage, and in arranging transport to JFK on our last day. Would stay again and suggest as a good place to friends/family travelling to NYC.\nRoom Tip: Higher floor for rooftop views & less noise, also proximity to Business lounge.
