It's across the street from a subway stop (1, 2, and 3 trains), and there is a very nice Westside Market just a few blocks away, as well as a couple of good fruit sellers. With a refrigerator and microwave in each room, it's handy for keeping a few supplies around. There are tons of great restaurants around as well. Try Tal Bagels! We were on the 9th floor and it was exceptionally quiet. Don't expect a stunning view, but how much are you going to be in your room? Everyone on staff who we dealt with was helpful and polite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:35:26.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
