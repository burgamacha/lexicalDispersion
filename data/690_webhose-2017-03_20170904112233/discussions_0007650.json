All the staff were very friendly. Room was not as small as expected. We had read reviews about bed being against the wall & although this was the case, the room was still a decent size and well laid out. It was very clean and the added touch of having a small kitchenette was a real bonus. Room had quiet air-conditioning and when we woke after a good nights sleep we commented on how quiet the room was. When we went for a walk there were major building works within a few feet of our window and we had not heard a thing.\nThere are various shops and places to eat within easy walking distance. The Tube is a short walk away and Buckingham Palace is your neighbour. This is a great little gem hidden away from main street and we will definitely use again.\nRoom Tip: We were on 5th floor and facing same street as entrance. Our room was very quiet.
