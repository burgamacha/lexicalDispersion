The staff and grounds did not disappoint.\nI took my mother here for her birthday and first trip to Paris, and they made the experience so special.\nImpeccable property and estate, finely-tuned service, high attention to detail. Just to give you an idea of their attentiveness: I cut off the crusts on my toast one morning at breakfast and at next day's breakfast, they had already done it for me. Incredible.\nThey anticipated every need with quiet grace, intelligence, and sensitivity. They really went above and beyond with a warm, generous welcome. I was moved by how they treated my mother on this special occasion. We also appreciated how un-stuffy the entire experience felt, as luxurious as it was.\nThe spa was fantastic, with an intimate hammam and a lot of privacy. My mother loved her massage and facial (2.5 hours with a tea break in between). We enjoyed the tasteful, live piano music every evening in the library.\nOn our last night, we had dinner at the two Michelin star restaurant downstairs, Le Gabriel, which was a beautiful experience.\nWe stayed for two days and it was worth every single penny.\nEmmy, Marco at Le Gabriel, Pierre...the entire staff: thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:29:14.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
