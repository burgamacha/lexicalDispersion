The service is excellent and the staff is very helpful. Upon arrival, Douglas (front desk staff) walked me through a map of Paris and made lots of good recommendations about getting around. Location is wonderful. There's a wonderful cafe on the block (Bo Man Cafe) that I went to most nights for a glass of wine before dinner, and you're only 3 minutes from the closest Metro station (St. George). Good (safe) location, helpful staff, comfortable rooms. As a solo traveler, this was perfect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:58:57.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
