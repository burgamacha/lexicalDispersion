Check in was nice and easy, the friendly receptionist gave us some good advice and some local maps.\nOur room on the 19th floor was large enough and very clean. It had only one single wardrobe between the two of us but it had plenty of hangers, there is also another unit with drawer storage so you will not have to live out of a suitcase. The bed was very comfortable and there was not too much street noise or any other noise from the rooms next door. The bathroom had a large walk in shower with rainfall head which was nice and powerful, the hotel also supplies toiletries. There is also tea and coffee making facilities in the room.\nWe did not eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. I would certainly recommend this hotel for both its location and very friendly staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:27:04.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
