We had a king corner room, which had a fantastic view of the NYE ball and easy subway access. Like most rooms in the city, it was on the small side but made the most of the space. It was modern, clean, well appointed (always love having a refrigerator and microwave) AND had a restaurant and bar onsite, which was great for this type of hotel. Best of all Michelle (ask for her!) went out of her way to make it a special visit, as we were celebrating my husband's birthday. Upon arrival, she gave us coupons for free drinks and appetizers ... and later in the visit the manager left us a bottle of wine in celebration. The only downsides were the HVAC system (seemed to have a life of its own), no black-out shades (needed to cover windows completely for the lights of Times Square), a comforter cover we asked to have changed and never was, and generally mediocre maid service. That said, the pros MORE THAN made up for the cons. It definitely surpassed my expectations. I highly recommend this hotel for a mid-range, chain-owned option!\nRoom Tip: King corner on the 27th floor was quiet and offered a great view!
