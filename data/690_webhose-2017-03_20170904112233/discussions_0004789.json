The room (we had a Queen Double) was surprisingly spacious. I was traveling w/o my family-- but we would have comfortably fit my family of 5 in this room with floor space for my children to play. The decor is very current and the lobby is warm and inviting. I would stay here again for sure. The location was great-- close to a quick bite to eat and close to 2 different subway stations (one at 77W and one at 72W). It was an easy trip from here pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. We were able to check our bags with the bellman before our room was ready and then again after we checked out on our departure day. This was a huge help in that all of that baggage would have been such a pain to deal with in the city. Lastly, the beds were comfortable! And I have back issues--- so the bed is important to me.
