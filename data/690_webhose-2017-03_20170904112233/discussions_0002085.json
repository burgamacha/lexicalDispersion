Upon entering the hotel the concierge with a great smile escot us to the check in counter. All employers are very friendly with high quality service, this gives us a warm welcome. The hotel is very clean including the rooms and it is beautifully decorated. The buffet breakfast is the best where my family always look forward. There are many choice from Traditional to American food. The best counter was the juice bar where we enjoyed our fresh juice. Anyone who is staying should not miss their buffet breakfast. The hotel is walking distance from (Shuangjing) subway station. I'll strongly recommend this hotel for everyone. We would definitely stay longer on our next return. Thank you to all your staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:28:41.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
