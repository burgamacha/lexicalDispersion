We could see Montparnasse Tower in the distance ... looked lovely at night.\nWe enjoyed the breakfast - sumptuous - and lovely coffee. Good service too. The central courtyard is very pretty.\nIt is walking distance from the Metro, and to Eiffel Tower as well. In fact, we walked to most places.\nGood eateries at walking distance- Lebanese, Chinese, and a lovely fruit stall as well.\nRoom Tip: Top floor overlooking the street is what we liked.
