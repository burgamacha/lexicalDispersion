I had a room on the 46th floor after an upgrade from the 9th. Thanks Holiday Inn :-) The lifts were fast and never any issues with queues or waiting time for the 3 lifts. Aircon worked well to warm room.\nBed quality:Excellent king sized bed with new and clean linen. Got a good nights sleep.\nBathroom:Shower pressure was good and bathroom ok. There wasn't any bench space to put things so had to juggle keeping things in room and bringing them to the bathroom as needed (hair brush etc). Not a reason not to stay, but just an observation.\nView: Excellent view out over the city.\nCleanliness: The hotel was tidy in an all areas and well maintained.\nThere were self service vending machines on several floors with soft drinks at a reasonable price!\nOverall this is a lovely hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay here again on future visits.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:25:54.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
