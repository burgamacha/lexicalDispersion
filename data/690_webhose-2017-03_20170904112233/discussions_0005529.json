The rooms were small, but what can u expect from a New York hotel! We only slept there so we didn't need a lot of space. It was clean and modern, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and happy. The location couldn't have been better, the subway station was right across the street, there were several delicious breakfast options near and the beautiful Bryant Park to sit and enjoy the view. We had a room on a higher floor, so it wasn't loud, we ended up with a view of the roof of the next door building, but I'm sure there are amazing views of the park if you wanted them. The door man remembered us every time we came in and out and made a point to talk to us and make us feel welcome! In a city where we found it hard to find anyone who was polite and kind, this hotel was a bright spot in our vacation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:07:48.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
