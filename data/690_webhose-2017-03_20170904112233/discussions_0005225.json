Small, but clean and comfortable room, nice bathroom. Complimentary water every day and good variety breakfast. An easy walk to the subway for access to \"everything\" - the subway is easily understood also for Firsttimers like us. Also short distance to sights like the Drum and Bell tower, and nice restaurants like the No name, with a nice roof terrace, and the Rui He Ju - with traditional Beijing hot pot.\nThe Trip Advisor location of the hotel is wrong, but the convenient maps.me was very useful - offline maps and GPS functionality made our strolls through the hutongs easy. We always felt safe, also at night with hardly any lights in the hutongs!\nAnd, the shadow art show was also nice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:19:49.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
