My son, his girlfriend and I were attending a concert at MSG. We took the train into the city and were easily able to walk the 1/2 mile to the hotel. Very easy to find. The hotel had a room for the three of us. Hotel was clean, nice, extremely reasonably priced and so easy to get to from major sites in NYC. I would def. go again. The only negative was the bathroom was rather small but overall it didn't matter as it was clean", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:06:37.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
