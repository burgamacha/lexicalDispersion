The room's design is beautiful in itself - spacious for New York, and with a stunning tub. The room service food is not great - but I don't think many tourists eat in in New York!\nAnd I was absolutely obsessed with the Marco Brambilla installation-like video in the lifts! They're truly stunning.\nHowever, I do have to complain about the staff.\nWe felt from the beginning that they seemed much more focused on daytrippers and to people visiting the hotel's bar as opposed to their guests. Fleeting, walk in commerce clearly trumps hotel guests who were paying to be there over numerous days and nights.\nThis is a mistake for a hotel that aims to be a destination setting for international travellers.\nThe reception staff weren't welcoming on arrival, which set alarm bells going . . . They were not forthcoming with information about the hotel itself or its amenities at check in - which we found odd - and they offered no insight into nearby dining/shopping/museum destinations when we asked.\nIn fact, they were rude and abrasive any time we engaged with them - which I have to say is most surprising for NYC! Any time I asked them questions over the days we stayed there they appeared summarily bored, and treated myself and my partner as if we shouldn't be bothering them . . . I felt especially bad as my partner had booked the destination as a romantic surprise, and had gone to such effort to book a killer room for us over a busy time of the year.\nAll in all, a beautifully designed hotel - but with terrible staff.\nRoom Tip: The higher, the more spectacular!
