Recently we stayed at their hotel in Bangkok. So we have become acquainted with the outstanding service and facilities in this hotel group. But wait until you try the Peninsula Paris. From the time your cab arrives until the very last day, you will be spoilt in every way.\nThe room is a wonder of high tech for a hotel room - the toilet seat warmer needed to be toned down for my sensitivities :) but the built in nail polish drier hit the mark.\nThe room (junior suite) was a prefect size (Paris hotels being notoriously small) for my grown son and me, The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was silent throughout. The curtains and awnings kept every speck of light outside.\nThe walk in wardrobe offered plenty of hanging space and a great dressing table.\nThe restaurants were all outstanding - many of the diners coming from other hotels just for dinner or breakfast at the Peninsula. The wait staff were very patient and helped with my rudimentary French even though they all spoke several languages including my own native English.\nI did miss the \"Lobby Shop\" only because I stock up in Hong King on the candied walnuts (a Peninsula specialty). But maybe later.\nThe Peninsula owners and management have done an outstanding job on the renewal and renovation of this wonderful building in Paris. They deserve huge congratulations. The wait was well worth it.\nThis will be our only hotel in Paris from now on. As I said at the start - try it for your next trip to Paris.\nRoom Tip: Try the junior suite for all the room you will need.
