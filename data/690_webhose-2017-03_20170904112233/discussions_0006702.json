The hotel is located on a quiet, cobblestone street lined with shops and restaurants in Seven Dials that is both convenient and quaint. You really can walk almost anywhere you would want to from this location, and there are several tube stops close by. The room itself was large and had fun but tasteful decor. Our bathroom had the deepest stand alone bath tub I have seen and a tv on the wall- a nice touch after a long day of walking around the city. We were on the ground floor so the view was not great but the noise was minimal. Service was always friendly but not overbearing and the ability to order drinks and dinner in the private library was another nice feature. We would definitely stay here again if traveling in London and recommend it strongly whether you are traveling with a family or on business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:48:42.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
