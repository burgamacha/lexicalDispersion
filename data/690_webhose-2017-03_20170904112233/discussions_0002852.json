I knew it was the right choice from the speedy and charming response to my e mails prior to making the booking and indeed during our 4 night stay there last week, the hotel met all my expectations. We were graciously and charmingly received by the front desk and escorted to our room. I booked a superior room and we were upgraded to a beautiful junior suite with a fabulous view of the Piazza. The soundproofing was so good that unless we opened the window we heard absolutely no noise at all from outside, or for that matter from other rooms too. The bed was enormous and extremely comfortable and the bathroom spacious. Everything was spotless and top rate. Breakfast in the morning has a marvellous choice so whatever your dietry requirements you won't go hungry. It was also elegantly served in a most friendly matter.\nWhat more can I say - 10 plus points to Fabio and all the staff. I have already recommended this hotel to a friend planning a trip soon to Rome. This is hoteling of the highest quality with true friendly service. A real pleasure to be a guest - and the final touch was the lovely handwritten note left for us on the last day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:35:15.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
