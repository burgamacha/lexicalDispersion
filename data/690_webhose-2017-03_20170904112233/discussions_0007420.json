We had a wonderful time and especially found the suggestions and kindness of the concierge, Lisa made our stay even more enjoyable. She was very helpful and suggested great restaurants and things to do. She was genuinely interested in our interests and tailored her suggestions to our needs. Thank you so much Lisa!\nRegarding the property itself, we found our suite very comfortable, and the staff were very helpful at addressing any concerns. Our one frustration was that there is only one elevator which functions, and I think that although we had no trouble using the stairs, if you have mobility issues, then it would be a problem, as the wait for the elevator is long.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:21:23.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
