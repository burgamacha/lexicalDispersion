And booked a room at the palace towers for one night for our daughter's bday through Amex. Were pleasantly surprised to say the least to be upgraded to an over the top 20,000$ a night 3 floor 2 bedroom suite with a roof deck. The most amazing views of the city! The service here is first rate, the in room breakfast was maybe the best we have had. The spa services were fantastic. The fitness center is well equipped and very clean with views of St. Patrick's. The location is probably one of the best In NYC. Would stay here again in a heartbeat even without the upgrade. A special acknowledgment of Ava in The towers reception for her first class check in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:33:19.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
