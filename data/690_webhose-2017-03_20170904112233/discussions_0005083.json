You do need to get on the metro to get more in the centre (unless you really do not mind walking) however this was not a problem for my boyfriend or I as the metro is very quick and easy. It's just a few stops from a more central location. The area felt very safe and quiet.\nThe hotel itself in my opinion was lovely. I cannot fault it and it's just what you need for a city break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:32:29.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
