There are good restaurants, cafes, and bakeries in the area including a covered street of shops. The hotel itself attempts to be quirky, with lights hanging from bowler hats and photos of the cast of British TV series The Avengers on the walls. The room was an ok size, with a large, soft bed, and plenty of closet space, as well as a safe for your valuables. The shower room appeared clean, though the cleaners had evidently been in a rush as some things were out of place and the tea/coffee tray not fully restocked. Staff on the front desk spoke perfect English (as did the majority of Parisiens we encountered) though there was a bit of confusion when we requested to merge our two bookings (first night was booked in my name while the second was in my partners) - resulting in a slightly panicked phone call when we were halfway around the Pompidou Centre when they thought we should have checked out.\nWhile there are areas for improvement, the hotel is extremely convenient, and the rooms sufficient for a short stay. Worth noting it's also one of the cheaper quality hotels in Paris, and we saw people of all nationalities staying there, so accessible to all, not just British or French tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:19:57.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
