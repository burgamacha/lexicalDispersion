The location was good in terms of it being bang opposite the metro. So easy to get around from here. There's plenty of bars and restaurants nearby with a small supermarket and pharmacy opposite. There aren't many shop shops so not masses to do in the area but with the metro in your door step and the Eiffel Tower 5/10 minutes walk away it's hard to complain.\nThe staff were friendly and helpful when asked any things.\nThe room... Hmmm mixed views on this. There were 3 of us squeezed into a very small room. The 3rd bed is not very long so unless you're short like me the third person may struggle. The mattresses are also very soft so beware to anyone who has a bad back. They're modern with a wet floor shower but no bath. Some toiletries are provided but I found it difficult to know which was shampoo and which was conditioner so I avoided using them sadly. The tea/coffee was poor. Very minimal given and we had to ask several times for more milk or tea bags as there isn't enough for 3 people. There's also not enough plug sockets and none by the third bed which is annoying for charging your phone.\nAlso only one door key is provided which isn't ideal for 3 people.\nIt's not a cheap stay but then again nowhere in Paris is. I would return but would also look for others with a more spacious room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:49:48.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
