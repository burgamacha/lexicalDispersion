From the second we arrived the staff were immense and very helpful with making sure to take our luggage right away. As per our Marriott reward status our classic double guest room was upgraded to a very spacious executive room. We do request a high floor room so I was a little annoyed to see we were situated on the -1 floor but with the long journey from the US we were just happy to see the big comfortable bed. The interior is luxurious and stylish and the Nespresso machine in the room was a sight to behold. Bathrooms are kitted out with L'Occitane prooducts which my girlfriend was delighted with and the room had a generously sized flat screen tv. Tube station is about a 6 minute walk and the staff are always happy to hail a cab for you if needed. We ate in the restaurant one night in which food was okay. We had a problem with one of our main courses which was rectified with free desserts so can't fault them there. The bar is also nice in pleasant to enjoy a drink in while watching the football. I requested a match be switched on the TV in the bar which was granted straight away. The cherry on the top was the room call we received to notify us we were granted a complimentary late check out, which was great for our late flight. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we're looking forward to going back where we are booked in again from 1st - 4th of June!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:16:01.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
