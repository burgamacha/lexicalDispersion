Ignore the negative comments, we had a lovely stay here. We had a Deluxe Double Room on the 30th floor and it was brilliant.\nAll the staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was great, everything you need (I would recommend going early as opposed to late). The kitchenette in the room was very well equipped and handy. Our room was very clean and serviced by the maids every day. Nice large rooms, safe is free and easy to use. Never experienced an issue with the lifts. Can't fault the hotel, great location, within walking distance of all of Midtown! This hotel was recommended to us by a friend and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:30:45.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
