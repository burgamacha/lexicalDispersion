Situated in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the hotel is at the heart of an amazing neighbourhood with independent restaurants and bars.\nWe didn't eat at the hotel but the food looked good. The staff were friendly and the rooms were just what you need.\nSmall well decorated rooms with Nespresso machines, a well stocked mini bar and a 50\" TV with cable (perfect for watching the news/sports when getting ready).\nThe rooms were clean, and the bed was honestly one of the comfiest i have slept in.\nLook forward to staying here again.\nRoom Tip: Ironing facilites and umbrella in the closet - Life savours if packing lite.
