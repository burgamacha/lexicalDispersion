And many thanks to the GM who manages to operate this project successfully.\nRoom Tip: Ask for quiet room if you need one See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:22:46.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
