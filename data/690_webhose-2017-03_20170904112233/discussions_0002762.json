Finland, Austria, Japan, Germany, etc etc I was there for the week for working downtown. The bar St George Tavern was great for happy hour with access to the hotel, they also serve the \"free\" breakfast off a menu which is better than most Express hotels, and service was good. Also has the Tipsy Shanghai chinese restaurant for a change of pace. 2 block walk to WTC. Also, Morton's steakhouse 2 blocks away.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:28:55.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
