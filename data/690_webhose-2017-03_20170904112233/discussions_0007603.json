We had a very early flight and we're just going to leave our bags and do a bit of sightseeing but the lovely lady on the desk let us check in early. The warm cookie you get on a arrival was a very welcome touch.\nThe room was spacious, large comfy bed and dual aspect view.\nHad food and drinks in the bar late on in the evening and it had a great atmosphere.\nAll staff are fantastic they are credit to the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:34:37.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
