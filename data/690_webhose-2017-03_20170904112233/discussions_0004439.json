The hotel is perfectly located at the bottom of the Champs-Elysees and directly across the street from the Tuileries Gardens. Request a room with a view of the Rue de Rivoli and enjoy views of the Eiffel Tower, Gardens and the Louvre. It is an easy and rather beautiful walk to the Arc de Triumphed, the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and many more of the amazing sites of Paris. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed with a very nice bar on the main floor. The club room is a small, unique and interesting little space that makes a nosh a fun little experience. We are walkers, but many of the top sites in Paris are easily accessible and public transportation to sites like Versailles and Monte St. Michelle are close and easily accessible. Obviously Paris is covered in caf√©s that offer delicious treats and tremendous coffee with a view and the few along the Rue du Rivoli in front of the Westin are no exception. We spent every morning with a baguette, cheese and coffee a minute walk from our door. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and it is worth every dime you pay.\nRoom Tip: Rooms with a view of Rue de Rivoli are a must See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:18:19.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
