Or just step outside into a taxis! The hotel staff were very pleasant, the rooms very clean and modern and the food excellent. The buffet breakfast was very good, but we felt rather expensive at 26 Euro each per day. We ventured across the road to Ribe and had equally excellent food for much less! Frame restaurant in the hotel was very cosmopolitan and we dined there three nights of our stay - excellent food and wine and well worth a visit. But again we ate at Ribe across the road and the food was comparable for less, but obviously no the same d√©cor!!!! Our room had the most amazing view of the Effiel tower and the Trocadero with a balcony (although no chairs to sit out) - but well worth paying the extra for the deluxe room with this view. Would we stay again, yes!\nRoom Tip: Deluxe room with balcony and view of Effiel tower and Trocadero well worth the extra.
