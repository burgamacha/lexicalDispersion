If you are looking for a chic boutique style hotel that's close to all popular tourists attractions then carry on reading this review. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. Firstly the location of this hotel is on a road with Starbucks next door and marks and sponsors on the other side so conveniently located to grab breakfast easily or refreshments. All major site seeing land marks such as Eiffel Tower, Champs-Élysées, Louvre Museum is near by. We caught the metro to Eiffel Tower which is a 5 minute walk to Saint-Augustin metro station and our journey to Eiffel Tower from here was 15 minutes on the metro. Champs-Élysées is around 5 minute drive in a taxi and costs around 10-12 Euros. Louvre Museum again was around 10-15 minutes in taxi and around 15-20 Euros. So location wise this hotel is fantastic! Secondly the hospitality & service of the staff at this hotel is superb! We have stayed at many hotels across the world and I was really impressed with how comfortable our stay was. The staff ensured we were always pleased and satisfied. Jean Louis the General Manager is excellent he greeted us upon arrival and ensured we had everything we needed throughout our stay. Thirdly the Diamond Suite is superb. I would encourage anyone staying at this hotel to upgrade to the suite it really is worth the experience. The suite comes with a king size bed which is very comfortable, a chic lounge area and state of the art bathroom. What impressed us most was the Japanese toilet and spa/shower with build in mood lighting and sound system. It was wonderful coming back to our suite after a day of sigh seeing around Paris. Overall this hotel gets a big thumbs up from me for location, hospitality, service and comfortability. It really is a chic hotel that's conveniently located and was a fantastic start to our weekend in Paris. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip memorable and unforgettable.\nMr & Mrs Walid\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:30:43.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
