I sometimes travel to NYC for business and it's nice for those trips too although not perfect. I usually travel with friends and it's a great crash pad after a night out - very convenient to travel throughout the city from here too. I particularly love the showers here, as they are spacious, clean, and modern.\nRooms are spacious (for NYC standards), well-designed, and impeccably clean. The hotel doesn't have a ton to offer in terms of amenities, but the bar and restaurant located on the first floor are very good. I've had maintenance and ironing requests before and the front desk staff have always been very helpful and accommodating!\nI'm very sad to report, however, that I recently learned the Distrikt will be leaving Choice Hotels brand. I'm sure there are sound business reasons behind the hotel's decision, but unfortunately I won't be staying here after the change. I travel frequently and those loyalty points are a big reason for picking where I stay. I went to book a trip for May this week and noticed that the hotel was gone from Choice's website. I wish them the best and would still advise staying here if you don't mind not getting points!\nRoom Tip: Higher floors are best!
