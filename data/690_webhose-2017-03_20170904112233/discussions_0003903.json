Having never been to London, we asked some British friends if the location was good. They affirmed. The staff is very international, as is (was?) all of London. They are attentive, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Their recommendations for restaurants, things to see, etc were excellent.\nThe beds are very comfortable, the room is modern, clean. Only complaint was that we prefer to be able to cool the room at night more than the controls allowed.\nLocated near Hyde Park Corner, it is very easy to use an Oyster Card and get around with the Tube and buses.\nThe restaurant inside the hotel (Ametsa with Arzak Instructi√≥n) is a 1 star Michelin rated with Basque influence. They were very accommodating in getting us in without reservations (early one night, late the other.) We dined there twice, once with the exceptional value of a shortened tasting menu for guests of about 43 Pounds. They have a longer tasting menu, but we would have needed advanced reservations to fit that in.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:35:22.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
