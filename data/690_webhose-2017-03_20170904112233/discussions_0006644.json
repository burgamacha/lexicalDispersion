It is right in the heart of NYC and is one block away from the Empire State Building and nestled between the prestigious Broadway and 5th Avenues.\nThe hotel itself was fine. I had read some troubling reviews about a smell of smoke in all of the rooms and noise coming from the hallways and outside. We stayed on the fourth floor, right at the corridor to the lift and not once did we hear any sort of noise. We also requested a non-smoking room and got one, with no scent of smoke at all. (We had both quit smoking about two months ago and would have been sensitive to the smell.)\nThe room itself was dark as it was at the back of the building but this also meant that there was no street noise. The room was spacious enough, again something we worried about after seeing other reviews. It was comfortable and I can’t really fault it. We didn’t have a huge amount of interaction with the staff but the reception staff were pleasant.\nThe breakfast buffet was something we only partook in once and at that, we had a coffee and a banana. There were a lot of rolls and donuts and pastries but nothing that someone with a yeast allergy could fill up on. But look, NYC is full of places to get a great meal anyway.\nRoom Tip: Rooms that don't face onto the street have little to no noise See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:44:05.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
