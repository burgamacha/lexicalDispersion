We stayed here ten years ago when we found the hotel perfect for a small family holiday. Returning with our twelVe year old daughter, the hotel was perfect for her first visit to Paris. It's location is excellent a ten minute walk to the Champs Elysee, five mins from a metro station and situated in a upmarket and very safe neighbourhood with shops and an excellent, reasonably priced restaurant (Del Papa) five mins away.The room was spacious and spotless and overlooked a pleasant courtyard. The staff were very professional but friendly and very helpful. The complimentary afternoon tea was a welcome treat after a long day sightseeing. Would definitely recommend and I am fussy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:54:58.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
