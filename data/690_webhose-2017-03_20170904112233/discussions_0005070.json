Great location outside the centre of Paris with quick access to the metro and so only about 10-15mins and you were right back in the centre. There were lots of nice bars and restaurants close to the hotel that were popular with the locals so not totally surrounded by tourists and therefore better prices too!\nThe hotel itself was immaculately clean and the staff were friendly and very helpful. We had a superior double with shower which was compact but perfectly adequate. Lovely fluffy towels (always a key indicator in my book!!) plus a free pair of slippers per guest . Toiletries were restocked on a daily basis along with tea and coffee supplies, although if there was any negative (struggling to find one) it was that there was only one milk per person per day but I am sure if reception were asked further supplies would be provided.\nBreakfast each morning was a superb continental with delicious cheeses and pastries, everything seemed beautifully fresh.\nAll in all a great 4 night break - would we return? Yes we would.\nThank you to all the hotel staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:08:10.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
