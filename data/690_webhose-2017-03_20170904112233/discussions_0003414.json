It's a nice area with some great eateries. The hotel is quite plush and well known for taxi drivers to find. We were offered a 'suite' on arrival for a further Â£35 a night. I'm unconvinced it was better than the classic double we originally booked looking at the photos. Notwithstanding the room and balcony was fine, but I just felt we'd been a bit taken advantage of,could be wrong. The staff were very efficient, helpful, friendly, the quality of fitments, huge bed, toiletries were good, excellent towels and sufficient/ generous in number. We had breakfast delivered to the room for an additional 8 euros, well worth it, it was very appetising, and eaten on the balcony. Really impressed bar my issue re the paid for upgrade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:03:39.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
