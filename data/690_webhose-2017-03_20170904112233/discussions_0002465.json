Very clean with comfy beds and pillows. Had blankets not duvets but was OK. A little noisy due to thin walls between ourselves and next room but otherwise had a fabulous stay. Its walking distance to Louvre or Notre Dame, Musee D'Orsay etc . Right by Metro and bus links to elsewhere but taxis also very cheap getting to all sights a bit further away. Also near to stop for the Big Bus Tour so great as a base for visiting Paris. Breakfast is really good value compared to local cafes but room has no windows so a little oppressive feeling, but if you want a filling breakfast for 9 euro you can't beat it.\nWill stay again when next in Paris.\nRoom Tip: Room 25 was a great twin.
