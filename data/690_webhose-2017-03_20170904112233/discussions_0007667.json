It is a beautiful hotel. Our room overlooked the lovely courtyard below. Room was spotless as was the bathroom which had toiletries provided. Breakfast was adequate. Cold meats, cold boiled eggs, pastries, rolls, cereals and yoghurts. Hot food consisted of fried eggs, mini Italian sausages and unusual beans. Choice of coffee, tea or fruit juice. We made the best of what was on offer and we were in Italy after all so we just got on with it. No complaints at all. Staff were all helpful. Very central for everything, metro, bus, train terminus five minutes walk. Restaurants, shops, mini supermarkets all in very plentiful supply surrounding the lovely hotel. Santa Maria maggiore Basilica facing front of hotel which was very well securely protected by police/army as was every main visitor attraction throughout Rome which made us feel very safe. Transport links were fantastic. We found the hotel excellent value for what we paid. We loved it all.\nRoom Tip: Just ask for a room with a lovely view.
