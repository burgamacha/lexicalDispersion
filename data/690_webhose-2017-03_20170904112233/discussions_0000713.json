I ve to say the location is great as it's near most of the musical Theatres and Chinatown is just a stone throwaway. There are lots of great food and it's so well connected to the Piccadilly Circus line. My first night was marred by an incident but the hotel's recovery was great. Immediately got upgraded to a suite and the rest of the stay was even better than before. Would highly recommend this place if u are looking for a good resting place. The breakfast by the way is pretty good too.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:45:49.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
