Everything about this hotel was incredible. The staff was very welcoming, in fact they offered to set our bags in the room when it was ready so we could start exploring Paris. The lobby was more of a place to sit and relax, with a great cup of espresso from the espresso machine. And the rooms were very comfortable and the metro station as well as the Eiffel Tower are only short walks away. We would definitely stay at other Inwood Hotels based on our stay on Tourville.\nRoom Tip: I don't think you could go wrong with any of the rooms.
