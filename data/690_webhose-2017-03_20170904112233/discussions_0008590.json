We visited for breakfast and dinner on our Christmas shopping day in the West End.\nThe food was outstanding in both cases and service which is what the Chesterfield does best was fantastic. Laurice is such a good Restaurant Manager and in the evening, it was wonderful seeing him deliver giridon service with my turkey and another guest's salmon.\nThe only downside is that the restaurant isn't busier in the evening as this would create a better atmosphere. We had a beautiful half bottle of red and also cocktails in the bar which were fantastic.\nWe will definitely be back and hope to have another stay in the not too distant future.\nWe were made to feel like valued customers at all times even though we weren't staying. Thank you again to all staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:14:14.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
