My passion is theatre and this hotel was decorated in all things stagey - I was beaming from the phantom of the Opera in the mirror - to the Wicked Witch of the Wests legs on the carpet as you left the lift - I loved it !! The rooms are all different - I had a twin room and it was small but perfectly formed with everything I needed.. it had an iron and a hairdryer and tea and coffee. I had read previous reviews that the plug for the kettle was in the safe but I could not get it to work so just plugged it in on the desk. Some older reviews state there is only one plug but this must have been addressed as there were many sockets and also a multi-plug adapter that has usb features too. The bed was comfy and pillows were ok ... I heard someone complaining about the pillow being hard but I did not think so - this is of course down to personal taste! I had one niggle in that there was only one small bin in the bathroom - I moved it to the bedroom area but imagine not everyone would do so - one more bin could save your room attendants a lot of work as there is nowhere to put your rubbish. The hotel is in a fantastic position for public transport - buses to Covent Garden run from just round the corner about 1 min walk - also from the same stop are buses to the Tower of London and Waterloo where you can travel to anywhere! The tube is a little further away but still only about 8 mins walk. Breakfast was amazing - people need to remember that you need to pay for breakfast in most hotels - this hotel has breakfast included in the competitive price and as such it is excellent - it focuses on quality of items over quantity which is very refreshing! Wonderful top quality ham.. freshly baked bread..cheeses ..fruit salad,, french toast in maple syrup ( to die for) various cereals ( including granola) yoghurts with coulis - home baked cakes and mini donuts on sticks - presented so beautifully worthy of a \" look at my breakfast!\" photo for Facebook ! Drinks include fresh orange and all sorts of hot drinks from a machine as well as filter coffee. I had a wonderful view of the Shard, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and could have stayed longer! I have already recommended to all my theatre buddies and will definitely stay here again.I had contacted the hotel prior to visiting re a mix up with the room and I had exactly what I asked for waiting for me - Thank you Marta! Also thank you for coming to my assistance when I cut my thumb.I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London but the Ibis Styles Southwark was the most friendly nad provided a perfect base for my weekend of theatre. Bravo !!\nRoom Tip: Rooms at the back face the Shard-but really how often do you look out of your room!
