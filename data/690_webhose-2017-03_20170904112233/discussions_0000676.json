Not more than a 10 minute walk from Forum des Halles, which is a huge shopping mall and has everything you could ever need including many restaurants and access to the RER and metro which has a direct line to Charles de Gaulle airport. The hotel itself is on a very quiet sidestreet and we never heard any noise from outside whilst we were there. There are many restaurants and cafes within a few minutes walk and we were spoilt for choice.\nThe hotel: We stayed in the cocoon room and after reading a few reviews on here before we went we were worried the room was going to be tiny. We were pleasantly surprised and had enough room for our needs. It is compact but perfect to just use as a base for sightseeing and being out and about for most of the day. The room was very clean, one of the cleanest we have stayed in and were given fresh towels each day. The bed was extremely comfy. We decided not to have the breakfast as there are plenty of places to eat close by. Each room is provided with a mobile phone which we took out with us every day. It gave information about places to visit and eat which could be booked through the phone. We found the phone invaluable as it gave us directions when we lost our bearings a few times.\nThe staff: Were very friendly and helpful and available 24/7 if we ever needed anything. When we arrived we were provided with a map and also suggestions of where to eat.\nWe had a great stay in this hotel and would definitely recommend it. If we were to visit Paris again in the future we would certainly return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:25:42.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
