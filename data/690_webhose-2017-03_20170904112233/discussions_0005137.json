The team was very friendly, the room is modern and has a very nice bathroom. The breakfast buffet was nice and got always filled up. The breakfast room could be bigger, but we always found a table. The hotel location is perfect to go out, many small restaurants and bars nearby, and it's less than 10min walk to La Bastille. Nevertheless it wasn't noisy in the room, and if there was noice outside the windows closed very well. Thank you very much, we will come back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:01:05.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
