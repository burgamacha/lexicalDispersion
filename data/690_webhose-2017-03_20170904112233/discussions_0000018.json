Convenient location just steps away from the central transportation hub (train, metro, bus, taxi) yet in a safe, nice part of the city with numerous restaurants and stores. The staff are exceptionally pleasant, knowledgeable and multi-lingual. We were delighted with our room and especially the fragrant, crisp white bed linens changed daily. Their roof top restaurant offers a delicious and inexpensive breakfast buffet with many choices for only 9 Euros and it's also open in the evening for light dinners/snacks/drinks. While there, you can borrow one of their table games or books for a fun, relaxing evening. There is a play area for children next to the exercise room and vending machines that dispense wine and beer as well as snacks and soft drinks. Their self-service laundry has a large capacity washer & dryer and the extra convenience of an iron and ironing board. As I said, these folks think of everything...even a \"Shower and Go\" area for a quick clean up before heading to the airport and a Nespresso machine in the lobby for a complimentary cup of Joe. Thank you, IQ Hotel staff and management for a delightful, memorable stay!\nRoom Tip: Ask for room G200 (on the ground floor) if you crave privacy and quiet seclusion.
