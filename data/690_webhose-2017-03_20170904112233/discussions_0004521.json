It was our first trip to Paris and we were very lucky with the choice of this Hotel. Not just because we made a great deal for a suit, the prices are fair and in relation for what you get. The stuff is friendly, the suit was big and clean in typical frech style such as the Hotel as it self. But the best thing about all, is the location, only a few meters next to the \"Arc de Triomphe\". The metro and bus station you get there as well, so you can easlily go anywhere you want in a couple of minutes. So for us it was the perfect place to stay, to see as much as you can in 2 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:34:24.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
