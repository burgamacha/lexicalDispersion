I'm rating it as a 5, because there is no 6. We received a very warm welcome when we arrived at reception and all of the staff we met were absolutely lovely. Our room was on the 6th floor- quiet, clean and a very nice bathroom with a good shower. Breakfast was very nice, with fresh bread and croissants. We were able to leave our bags after we had checked out and the hotel even have umbrellas available for customers to use when it's a bit damp in Paris. We have visited Paris on a number of occasions and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. It's a little way out from the main attractions like Notre Dame, The Eiffel Tower etc, but it's short walk to the Metro and lines 1 or 6 will get you to the sights. We'll certainly book again on our next visit to Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:08:46.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
