The view is not the priority nor the best aspect. However the large windows let in a lot of sunlight which is agreeable in the morning. Barely any traffic noise. The room decoration could significantly be improved because they utilize cheap wood and finishings which reminds me of ikea and low-class office material. No original colors nor pleasant touches. That was a big disturbance for me. However one aspect of the room that cannot go unnoticed is that there a door separating the main entrance from the living area + bed which maximizes tranquility and SILENCE. I did not use any hotel amenities such as restaurant so cannot review that. One incident really compelled me to make a small scene at the reception which was that the housekeeper disregarded the \"do not disturb\" sign and still came into the room to clean and make the bed. Although I was not in the room. It is a habit of mine to never request room service because I am clean and especially I DETEST having a stranger in my personal space when I am absent. The reception simply apologized and made sure to speak to the maid. However the next day I could not stay quiet so I found the maid and expressed myself. The location of the hotel is adequate, but since I love to walk, I would reach central areas conveniently.\nRoom Tip: ask for a courtyard room See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:14:38.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
