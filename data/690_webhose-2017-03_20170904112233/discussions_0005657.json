We stayed on the 5th floor and asked to be on the quiet side of the street because we had our 3 year old with us. The staff was very accommodating to that. King size bed was perfect and comfortable for the 3 of us who only stayed one night. Room was very clean. If you have children, a hotel with a pool is a must! We picked this hotel for that reason. The pool was small but just right for our toddler. I would go back there anytime because it was so close to Times Square and all the fun kid attractions in New York.\nRoom Tip: Ask for a quiet room if they are available.
