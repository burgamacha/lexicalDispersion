Decided to make an evening of it.\nI came straight from work so was missing a few essentials such as toothbrush, razor etc. Staff on request supplied me with these amenities.\nI got to pick my room before I got there so went for the city airport view. Not only can you see the runway and planes taking off but you cannot hear a thing.\nThe room was very clean and tidy and perfect for its main custom who are business people on short stays.\nHowever it doesn't get full marks from me. This is because the air con unit was making an annoying ticking noise intermittently. It wasn't enough to complain about but enough for me to write about it.\nWe ordered breakfast to the room but only one because I didn't want to eat. Even though we clearly marked this on the sheet, breakfast for 2 arrived and I was charged for it.\nLastly, there is no express check out. The paperwork can all be done when you check in but something as simple as having a bowl to leave your room key in as you leave doesn't exist. I find it hard to believe that the majority of stayers don't want to method and when I had to queue up just to hand my key back in, it kind of defeated the point of the paperwork I done at check in.\nSo all in all it was great however I have listed the above small niggly points due to the amount of competition in that area. And that's coming from a loyal Hilton stayer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:36:43.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
