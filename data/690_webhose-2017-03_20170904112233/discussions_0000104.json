Its in a prime location near the Embassy's and not far from PEK. Check in was efficient, and I was given room 2618 which is a Club Room also on the Club Floor. The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. There were numerous bottles of water...I think I counted 6. The bathroom is large, and the pressure from the dual showers is just right.\nThe Club Lounge is a decent size with nice views of the city (assuming a clear day). It features ample snacks and beverages, and my only complaint, albeit minor, was that the breakfast selection was limited. But, the food quality was quite good. I did use both the swimming pool and fitness center. The latter is stocked with a decent selection of modern equipment, so you have no excuse not to stay in shape while on business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:09:21.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
