Would definitely recommend. Yes the rooms are small but it's New York. You don't visit to stay in your room all day either. The room was compact but offered us everything we needed - a very comfy bed, peace & quiet, bathroom with a great shower & also good storage for our clothes & cases. The staff in the hotel were very friendly & helped us sort an extra night's stay when our flight home was cancelled due to bad weather. The location of the hotel couldn't be much better. There's a subway less than a 2 min walk away & you are also right beside central park. There are lots of good cafes nearby to grab breakfast too. We loved the Morning Star.\nRoom Tip: We were on the 16th floor & found it lovely & quiet See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:49:03.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
