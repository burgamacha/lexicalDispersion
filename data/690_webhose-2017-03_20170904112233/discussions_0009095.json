But on 6th floor and a very nice view. Could see Lord Nelson on his column!\nA very decent sized room, but only one chair. I did not need two, but what if two are staying in this double room?\nThe granola at breakfast just as delicious as last!\nAlways very nice people in the reception, and the best service!\nThank you again, all of you. If the price is not too bad, I will love to come back!", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:24:43.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
