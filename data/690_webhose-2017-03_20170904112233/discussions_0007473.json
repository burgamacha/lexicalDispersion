Clean and quiet. Situated close to Paddington and Hyde Park, it was only a 20minute walk to Oxford Street. Roomsize varies alot, we had three rooms on different flors, but all of them was nice and clean with good beds. Not run by English, however, the English breskfastbwas great. Always served with a smile. Recommend this hotel for a visit in London.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:50:36.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
