It was really lovely. The location cannot be beat. Smack in the middle of everything you want to do/see in Paris. Metro station and bus stop across the street - easy to reach everything.\nThe reception is casual and friendly. The hotel lobby is bright and has great lounge area with wonderful coffee table books. Breakfast area comfortable with firelplace and fun decor.\nOur room was a superieur. I had been warned in others' reviews, but was still surprised at how small it was.... it was really small. I was traveling with my 9 year old daughter who doesnt \"take up a lot of room\" ; ) but it was pretty much the bed and room to maneuver around the bed. There was a small desk, but we would have much preferred a little bureau with drawers for our clothes.

Both of these were claustrophobic and not pleasant to use. For a longer stay like ours, I would not choose this size room again.\nWe had breakfast included and it was really great! wonderful selection of delicious cheeses, pastries, fruit, eggs, smoked salmon, etc. Great coffee. we really enjoyed beginning our mornings there.\nService was very good. We broke a glass in our room and someone came right away to clean it up and vacuum. Maid service was excellent. Sheets were very nice quality.\nRoom Tip: We had #76, a superior. Small, but view of ancient St. German de Pres church and Eiffel Tower (if yo...
