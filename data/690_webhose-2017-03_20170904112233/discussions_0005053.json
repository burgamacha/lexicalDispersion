The rooms are on the smaller side, but they have a nice cozy feeling. The hotel staff is very professional and friendly, and the bar tender at the lobby bar whipped up some creative and tasty cocktails for us.\nThe best part about this hotel is its location. This place is right in the middle of Vendome, which is very nice part of Paris. It's basically a 2 minutes walk from the tuileries gardens and the Place Vendôme. The Louvre is less than 10 minutes away by foot, and Most of the major landmarks of Paris are within walking distance, including the Eiffel Tower, Champs Élysée, Notre-Dame, Les invalides, etc...\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel that doesn't break the budget yet still offers excellent service and a great location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:45:08.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
