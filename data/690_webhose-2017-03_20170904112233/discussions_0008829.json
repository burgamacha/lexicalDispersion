To start with I booked online at their website and was able to request where my room was in the hotel, type of view, type of pillows and if I wanted extra pillows (all at not cost) Everyone I encountered couldn't have been more helpful. When I order a glass of wine to my room it was delivered by the sommelier himself. The food both room service and breakfast was excellent and freshly cooked rather than canteen style. Did I also mention that the whole decor was modern and very stylish from the rooms to the lobby. All the services were ordered through a tablet next to the bed where you could just click and order, no more dirty 'info books' here. Outstanding\nRoom Tip: book through their hotel and you can chose the rooms See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:14:44.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
