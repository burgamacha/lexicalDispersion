We find it ideally located for sightseeing with the Imperial War Museum on the doorstep and not too far from the underground. The staff are friendly, polite and helpful. Rooms aren't huge but good for a long weekend with tea/coffee which is refreshed each day. The bathrooms are modern with complimentary toiletries. My only bugbear is the wardrobe space which would probably be too small for stays of longer than two nights. The bed is quite soft but we found it comfortable.We had the continental breakfast which is good value and the staff are always on hand to refill and keep the dining area clean and tidy. We took our car and parked at the hotel. It's Â£20 a day so not cheap but it is convenient.We will be looking to book again for July as it's our son's graduation. I would recommend this hotel to all those wishing to stay in London and who are looking for value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:14:21.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
