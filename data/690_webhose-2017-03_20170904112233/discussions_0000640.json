We had a room on the 7th floor- it had 3 beds over 2 floors, which was fine. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. The hotel ticked all our boxes because it was not expensive and we did not plan to stay in it for more than just sleeping before we go out again and see the city. The window of the room has a simple chain lock - which was the only thing I was a little worried about when staying with my children but it was fine.\nWe went for breakfast one morning and decided to eat in a local bakery down the road for the other mornings. The breakfast is ok but a little on the bare side and I found it expensive for what they were offering.\nIf you are going to stay to see Paris - its a great hotel. It is not pure luxury but it fits the bill well. The hotel is near the Metro and near lovely restaurants and bars if you want to go. We ate in Le hide and in L'encrier scop- both were divine and a walk away from the hotel.\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful- they did their work very well! I would come and stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:53:43.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
