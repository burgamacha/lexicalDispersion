It was a fantastic hotel. Located a few minutes walk from the metro and termini station and about 15 minutes walk from major attractions like the colosseum.\nThe hotel itself is very modern and clean. Housekeeping is impeccable, we returned each day to a freshly stocked room and as clean as if we had just arrived. They provide complementary toiletries of shower gel/shampoo, conditioner & body lotion. A shower cap and a 'vanity set' is also provided. There is tea and coffee making facilities and complimentary bottled water; still and sparkling. The vending machine provides a lot of other items should you have forgotten your toothbrush etc. There was even a chocolate heart left on each pillow on Valentine's Day!\nThere is free wifi through out the hotel and guests have use of the gym and sauna. There is a rooftop bar/restaurant, the food and drinks are reasonably priced. Breakfast was not included in our booking but we did use the hotel for breakfast once. It is a buffet and reasonably priced at â‚¬9.50 each. There was a great selection from cereals to cooked items, fresh pastries and bread, fresh orange juice and of course coffee!\nI found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful at all times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:49:07.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
