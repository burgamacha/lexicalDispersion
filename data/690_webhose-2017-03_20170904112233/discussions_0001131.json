I'm blown away by this hotel . Exceptional. Stayed in a deluxe jnr suite, which we were upgraded to as it was my daughters birthday. Basically like a small luxurious apartment. Turn down service every evening, including pillow spray and chocolates.\nBreakfast each morning was delicious. Buffet was very small but that didn't matter as we ordered from the extensive menu. Highly recommend the Italian eggs.\nHappy hour each evening commenced at 6 pm and consisted of a large menu of drinks and delicious nibbles. All complimentary.\nWe ordered a movie one evening and which included popcorn and soft drinks again all complimentary.\nThe location was great. 5 minutes walks to Buckingham Palace. 15 minutes walk to the London Eye.\nAll the staff were fabulous.\nA wonderful stay and we will definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:02:51.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
