The Halkin is a boutique hotel, very centrally located (close to Hyde Park Corner) however on a quiet street (Halkin Street). The rooms are very pleasantly decorated, the beds very comfortable and the linen of very good quality. The multi-national personnel is very helpful and attentive and one always feels welcome. The Halkin has a one Michelin star restaurant \"Ametsa\" specializing in Basque cuisine, which is excellent. The existence of such a restaurant in the premises elevates the other hotel services which are related to food like in room dining and especially breakfast! The breakfast menu excels in offers which go beyond the usual as far as availability in choices for \"healthy breakfasts\" including but not limited to a variety of freshly pressed juices and other healthy morning juice cocktails, without missing out on the traditional \"heavy duty\" breakfasts. It's a great hotel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:29:41.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
