The hotel is very conveniently located - close to Trafalgar Square, Jubilee Bridge and two tube stations. The room was fine and had a good kitchenette. No daily housekeeping but that was no problem for us. Breakfast was 12GBP but we bought cereal from a nearby store.They have a cell phone with free local minutes and data that you can use during your stay and which is handy to have on hand as you go about the city.\nOverall I recommend this hotel as good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:12:29.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
