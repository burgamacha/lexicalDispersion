We loved it so much - The location was so easy and the staff was so friendly. Quick access to Eiffel Tower, Metro, Restaurants, quaint streets - everything we could have asked for. The Hotel was tiny, but we loved that too. They always had coffee and a little snack in the lobby, the concierge was BEYOND nice - he showed us how to use the metro, gave us little tips and more. We will stay there again next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:26:51.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
