Rooms are neat and it seems that the bathrooms are newly renovated. We had decent views of the streets outside. It's a quiet and comfortable hotel. Most important thing is the warm reception you will get when you enter this place. Lovely feeling . It's a non smoking hotel and eating food inside is not allowed I think. So just keep that in mind\nTip : Check Google maps on the exit from the station .", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:24:52.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
