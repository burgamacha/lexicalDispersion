It's also only a few blocks from Times Square and centrally located near lots of bars and restaurants.\nThe room was clean, 'cozy' (like everywhere in the city) but big enough for us, nice shower etc.\nThere's a small gym on the ground floor with the basics; couple of treadmills, an elliptical and bike, enough to get some cardio in.\nThe staff are extremely accommodating, we were worried about not being able to travel home due to the big snow storm we were scheduled to get and the manager told us they'd make sure they were able to book us an extra night if needed or even cancel our second night if we needed to leave early! We ended up doing neither and left when planned but the fact they were going to go out of their way for us was fantastic, especially considering friends of ours staying at another much more expensive hotel DID need to leave early and their hotel wouldn't let them cancel their room because 'it never snows in NYC'?!\nThe morning of our departure the staff at Holiday Inn even called our room to double check we still had our travel plans, making sure we didn't need to book another night before they were all booked up!\nWe go to NYC once every year and will definitely be coming back here again next year. The location, price, and staff can't be beat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:48:06.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
