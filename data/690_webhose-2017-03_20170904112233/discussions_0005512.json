Rooms are may be too little even for 2 but they are so beautiful that you can forget the fact of the size. Staff is very friendly. Two things to improve, breakfast is too expensive (for 14 euros you can have a complete lunch in the area) also a kettle to boil water would be great. You have the chance to keep luggage in the hotel even after checkout. Best of all the central location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:20:55.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
