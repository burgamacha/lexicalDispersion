At the end of Rue Caron was a charming square, typical of the area, with a choice of fabulous restaurants, or just a bench to sit and enjoy the view. I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't fault hotel Caron which was very clean. L'occtain essentials were in the bathroom which housed a generous shower. My room was warm and I was able to self adjust the heating. The bed was super comfortable and for the 1st time I lay on very comfortable pillows. The bed linen was changed daily.\nThe breakfast room had everything you could wish at only â‚¬14, it was here I was able to plan my day ahead.\nThe staff were very welcoming and most helpful.\nI found my room quiet and peaceful throughout my stay.\nI was a few minutes walk from Saint Paul's Metro on Rue Rivoli, a busy shopping area and very central for all the tourist sites.\nWill I revisit?
