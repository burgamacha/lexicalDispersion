My daughter and I were visiting from New York City and felt very welcome. The rooms are exquisitely designed and the beds comfortable. We appreciated the teatime refreshments laid out after a busy day sightseeing. Booked the spa for an hour for a little relaxing time. Highly recommend and hope to visit again.
