It is in an excellent location, just a minute's walk to Times Square. Whilst it is very central we had no problem with noise at night.\nThe room itself was really good, USB charging ports, TV in room and the room was a decent size with plenty of storage. The bathroom was also a good size with hairdryer and a shower over the bath.\nThe breakfast was pancakes, waffles, cereal etc. The dining room and lobby looked recently refurbished and there was also a small gym available if you felt walking around the city all day was not exercise enough!\nThe reception staff were helpful and booked us on a day shopping trip.\nIf I return to NY I would not hesitate to book this hotel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:13:26.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
