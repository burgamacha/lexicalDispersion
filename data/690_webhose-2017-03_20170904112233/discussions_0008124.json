A lovely warm welcome was had by Nurun and Canan on reception. Very helpful in giving us directions to the nearby tube station at Canary Wharf.\nThe rooms were compact and clean, with everything needed for a good nights kip.\nThanks also for the Facebook link which contained a gift of a late checkout worth Â£10.\nI plan to visit London later this year and will definitely choose Point a hotel again.\nLovely location, lovely staff, what more could you want x\nPaul Walker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:22:24.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
