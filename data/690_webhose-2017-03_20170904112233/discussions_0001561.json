No problem was too small for them to help us with.\nWe checked in, in the early hours and they were just as polite and charming as they were during the day.\nHotel room was a decent size with a lovely sized shower room, you just need to be aware that there's only a limited amount of hanging space and the only drawers you have are by the bed.\nThe breakfast was well stocked and if you didn't want the complimentary food the menu for the paid breakfast was varied and tasty. Again the staff in the restaurant were always around to help and re-fill drinks.\nI only had one minor issue in that when you check in they take a $300 holding deposit which is refunded but that can take up to 30 days, this was advised when I queried why I hadn't had the money back a few days after I got home as the reception staff told us it should happen straight after you've checked out,\nAll in all a wonderful hotel with the added bonus of a rooftop bar, sadly during winter though it's covered. Perfect location as just a quick walk to Times Square, would definitely stay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:14:12.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
