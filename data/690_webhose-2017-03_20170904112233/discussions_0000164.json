We contacted the Concierge before our arrival to confirm our reservations and ask general information. Our experience from the Front Desk to the service personnel was completely helpful and welcoming. The food in the breakfast buffet was very tastefully presented and delicious. The Dining Room staff was very polite and pleasant and encouraged patrons to try freshly baked breads and pastries. Everyone at the hotel was able to speak several languages, most especially English.\nFinally I would like to compliment the hard working maids, porters and other service personnel who are prompt, courteous and very pleasant in meeting any patrons needs as much as is possible.\nI Absolutely would highly recommend the Hotel Artemide in Roma, Italy to all my family and friends as well as others in North America and Europe who speak primarily English. i give this hotel 5 Stars and More... My sincere thanks for a wonderful experience and family focused experience in a professional friendly manner. We definitely look forward to returning in the near future. Many thanks for our fantastic experience far from home...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:23:50.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
