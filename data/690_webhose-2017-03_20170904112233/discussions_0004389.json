The staff were very charming, courteous and efficient. Located right next to l'Opera it was ideal for getting around and great links to RER which made it straightforward getting to airports. Also great as it is a short walk to the Louvre, Jeu de Paume and Les Tuileries. It is not the kind of place to hang out though as it has few amenities but lovely for what it does offer and overall it was a great little hotel to use as a base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:20:00.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
