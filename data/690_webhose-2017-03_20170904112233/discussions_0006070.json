It is incredibly quiet. The room is beautifully furnished and I would love to take the bathroom home: it is much better than mine! The attention to detail is amazing. The hotel itself has free shadow puppet performances which are stunning. This does encourage you to pay for your own shadow puppet painting lesson! The staff are brilliant. Even though we had checked out, we used their facilities all day as we had to wait until late for our plane. They looked after us so well. Thank you to everyone at this hotel. We loved it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:18:55.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
