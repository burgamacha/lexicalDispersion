There were so many wonderful members of the Iroquois staff that truly enhanced my vacation. Christoph at the front desk, Vanessa and Bill at the concierge desk, Carlos the doorman, along with their colleagues, made us feel special. And because use this was a very special trip to celebrate my niece's birthday, the extra effort was really important to me. It is very evident that the staff takes pride in doing their job well. The bed and pillows were super comfortable and the hotel restaurant is well worth the splurge! And the walking tour that the hotel provides is extremely well done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:00:41.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
