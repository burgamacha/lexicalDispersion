We were there for just one night before moving on to the south of France, and it really was a great home base for a long day out and about.\nAs others have noted, the facilities are a bit dated and smaller than usual - most specifically the bathroom - but overall it's absolutely fine (just not the typical Westin bathroom). I loved the high ceilings and old fireplace in our room, and the as always heavenly bed after an overnight flight.\nThe famous Angelina Paris is just down the street - I skipped the long line to go inside and instead got a hot chocolate from the cart outside.
