The rating is for the staff who were great. Fast, efficient and friendly. Every one from front of house to the ladies who service the rooms was polite and friendly and happy to help.\nThe room? Decent size but noisy from being on a main road and the double glazing is fairly inefficient. The towels are small, the pillows hard. But it's a budget hotel so all manageable. There was little/no noise from other guests.\nBreakfast? A good selection all you can eat. English/continental breakfast. Not badly priced.\nThe hotel? If you're driving, the cheapest place to park is at Westfield shopping centre. But then not being local and finding your way can be an issue. Ok if you've not got much luggage. Once we knew the way it was about a 15min walk. But only cost Â£25 for the 3days. To Stratford tube station its about a 10min walk through Stratford shopping centre. Just be warned at night this can be an experience as it seems to turn in to a hang out for the local skating community. A little intimidating if you're not used to it or on your own.\nAll in all, it's not a bad location for the o2 at a budget cost. After all, it's in the heart of the East end of London, it's busy and it's going to be noisy.\nThe staff are working with what they have and they certainly make the effort to make you feel welcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:27:34.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
