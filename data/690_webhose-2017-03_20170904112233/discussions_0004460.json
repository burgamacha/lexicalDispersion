We had the most amazing view of the Empire State Building from our room. The hotel is only a few blocks from Time Square and within easy walking distance of all the Broadway plays. There are tons of restaurants and liquor stores less than a block away. The subway is only 2 blocks away as well and fairly easy to get around on once you get the gist of it. The room was cozy but nice. There was very little noise heard from the other rooms, and the pillows and beds were cozy. I'm not going to lie, there is not a ton of storage space so you will need to unpack a bit and store your suitcases under the beds and get a bit creative with the ledges in the room. The beds are doubles, so make certain you like whomever you share a bed with ...or sleep alone. The staff was made us feel we were at a luxury hotel. Evan was the best. They even called to remind us to set our clocks ahead for daylight savings! We loved every night of our 5 day stay.\nRoom Tip: Floors on the 15th floor has enormous ceilings with showcase the Empire State Building See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:14:36.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
