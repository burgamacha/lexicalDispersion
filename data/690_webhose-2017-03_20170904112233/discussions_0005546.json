They have all the facilities in the Hall. I was here for 5days workshop. Rooms are extraordinary, beautiful and so comfortable. They have amazing big green gardens. The breakfast buffet is delicious with so much of options, lunch and dinner was fantastic too. The Olympic size pool is the best place to relax in the evenings.\nEnjoyed my stay here.
