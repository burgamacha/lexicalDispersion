This hotel is in the heart of Paris, on an amazing street, especially at night where you can enjoy some amazing food and watch the world go by. The staff were great and so welcoming, contrary to many comments made on here. The rooms were a great size, and kept clean and tidy all the time. This hotel was the perfect hub for exploring Paris and seeing what I believe to be the best city in the world. Me and my partner will certainly be returning in the future, as this is the best trip we have ever been on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:26:05.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
