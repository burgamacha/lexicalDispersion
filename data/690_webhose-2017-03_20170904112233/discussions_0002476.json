Good large deluxe room(difficult to keep the lighting low in the bathroom) but no stocked mini bar if important to you.The beauty for us was that there is a choice of dining, fine, or the more casual area in the Sansibar brasserie.Pizzas delicious and the baby chicken divine.We watched Murray in the Dubai final seated by the bar and spoilt by the excellent service from the team of waiters.There is a dedicated walk around the vines which takes 20-30 minutes before a superb breakfast cooked to order. They will print off the UK paper for you for 70Rand. Finished off with morning and early afternoon by the pool before we left for the airport. Brilliant!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:43:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
