It is not the first time I have stayed now it is my favourite place.\nEverything is superb and consistent on every visit. From the soothing champagne arrival just what you need after the travelling to all the little things they suggest and do through out your stay . I had organised a few birthday surprises a cake made in house, balloons & flowers everything was presented beautifully as requested with great thanks to Flo.\nFrom suggesting restaurants, receiving shopping, and organising taxis so very helpful nothing is too trivial for them the attention to detail spot on. The food is lovely very tasty, and they can tweak things to your own personal requests. Had cakes and fruit in our room as well. Then there is the Pantry and all of the tasty bits and bobs,never mind Chefs special nightly dish. The lounge itself is luxurious but comfortable. Don't waste your money staying in the Ritz or Savoy or any other fancy hotel in London stay in the best unique and most Luxurious Hotel 41 with the best staff in the country.
