We took breakfast in the hotel but also went out and had breakfast in local bars. The hotel is well positioned - a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe where there is good access to the metro. We travelled from Gare du Nord to Arc de Triomphe by 31 bus - takes a long time, but is more interesting that the metro. A hotel we will consider using again.\nRoom Tip: Room 11 is on ground floor, has a 'wet room' shower, good for people with mobility problems.
