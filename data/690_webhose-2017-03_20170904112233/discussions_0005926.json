We got the biggest room of the hotel. Rooms were cleaned daily. The breakfast can be improved specially the crepes could be better. The reception persons were very helpful and spoje very good english. The hotel is in the bank neighbourhood and hence, most of the shps close down quite early. The downtown is very near, galleries lafayette, louvre museum, des halles forum, pont de neuf are very near to the hotel. The nearest metro station is bourse, which is at 8mins walking distance. They arranged a airport shuttle facility for our airport drop which is quite cheaper than taking a taxi.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:10:56.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
