The view from the window is Paris, 1920's. Boulangerie on one corner, cafe's on two corners and a Charcuterie. Not to mention an amazing ice cream/gelato/sorbet/macaroon shop. There are countless cafe's - all of them very good. The hotel is a short walk to Notre Dame and Le Louvre, St. Germaine des Pres, Jardin du Luxembourg, etc. . . . Shopping is tremendous in the area too. The hotel itself is a charming boutique style hotel. We were in the Grande Suite du Maine so I believe its the largest suite and the bedroom was enormous. There was a living room with a pull out sofa and two separate bathrooms. There was even a walk in closet in addition to three other closets that was large enough for me to use as a dressing room. Julian and all the staff there were very helpful. They even let me try out my struggling french on them to help me get better. We had breakfast there our last morning and it was surprisingly delicious with lots of choices! If you're looking for a great hotel location in Paris with a genuine Parisian feel, this is the one.\nRoom Tip: For family the Grande Suite du Maine on the third floor is the largest room See more room tips", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:36:36.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
