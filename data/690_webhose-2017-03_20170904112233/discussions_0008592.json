I am certainly glad I did! From the moment I called to inquire about staying there, to when I left to return home, they were wonderful. The front desk staff, Kelly in particular, were just amazing. I left my Iphone cord at the conference, no problem, they charged my phone for me. Sounds like no big deal, but it certainly mattered to me. My room...I said I liked light, so they gave me a beautiful corner 1 bedroom suite overlooking the art deco New York City Center across the street. My first room had no tub, no problem, they switched my room as soon as one became available in a few hours. I was so comfortable throughout the entire stay, The keurig coffee pot and little fridge made it so much more so. Not to mention the nice tub to relax in after a long day on my feet. And a shelf full of books in the room to choose from as well. I will be back. It is a hidden gem.\nRoom Tip: Facing the front- 55th See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:07:16.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
