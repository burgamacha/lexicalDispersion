Situated just off the Champs Elysee and very near the Arc de Triomph, it was perfect location wise. It is surrounded by many shops, and restaurants and several metro stations are just walking distance. The staff were very friendly and helpful, in particular Angelo who was able to give us great suggestions for dinner and patisseries. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:21:41.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
