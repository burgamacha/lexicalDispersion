We were travelling with 3 children and we received such a warm welcome and excellent service from every member of staff. Everything about the hotel is brilliant - the buffet breakfast, the all day complimentary afternoon tea, the location (easy walking distance to main tourist areas and lots of amazing restaurants), the decor, the ambiance. We really didn't want to leave. I can't recommend this place enough.\nRoom Tip: Room 62 has a view of the Eiffel Tower.
