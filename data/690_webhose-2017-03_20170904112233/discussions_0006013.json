A personal service starting already a few days before, to the arrival up to our checkout. An upgrade to a better room. A perfect service. A mobile phone in the room that can be taken in the city. A great breakfast buffet. A choice of pillow and odors... I was looking for a weekend with a touch of luxury and you made it unforgettable!\nIza from guest services has really made our stay from great to gorgeous!\nI dont need to look anymore where I will stay next time I am going to London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:50:58.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
