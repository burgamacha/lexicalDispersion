From evening Bar staff, to cleaners, breakfast staff and reception, all provided helpful and efficient service. Our room on the 1st floor, although not a large room was more than adequate with all amenities provided and an especially modern bathroom. We were worried about noise from the bar but there were special doors that closed rooms off from this area in the evening. The location is fantastic and so easy to walk to the Colosseum, the Forum and Trevi Fountain to name a few. At the Piazza Republica just a short distance along Via Nazzionale is the Metro to get you to the Spanish Steps, Piazza Del Poppolo and the Vatican City if your legs need a break. Eating is a dream with so many restaurants in the neighborhood to choose from but after we had eaten one night at the Diadema just around the corner on via Palermo, it was hard to go anywhere else. The Ravioli and the Panna Cotta are superb. Special mention to Nicoletta on hotel reception who helped me with flowers for my wife's significant birthday and then with urgent paperwork for printing, scanning and emailing. She was great. As you can tell, we really enjoyed our Rome stay at the Rome Times Hotel.
