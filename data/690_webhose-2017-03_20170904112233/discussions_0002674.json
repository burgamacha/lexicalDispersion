While a lot of hotels focus on hype and trend (not to say that The Surrey doesn't have any of these positive elements) but miss the mark on the hospitality experience, this place manages to maintain a high level of luxury in executing genuine service that makes you more and more comfortable at every turn. Room service by Daniel Boulud is delicious, Bellmen are friendly, Desk staff is accommodating, housekeeping is prompt and swift, and Miles from the sales office has a great understating of how to ensure guest's needs are met. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay on the UES.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:15:04.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
