It was also very clean/updated with friendly and efficient front desk staff. My only complain is that the rooms are VERY VERY small even by NYC standards. No room to put your suitcase on the floor even (they have space under the beds for this). That said, as long as you don't plan to spend any time in your room except for sleeping it's a nice place to stay.\nRoom Tip: ask for a room that has views of the Empire State Building See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:33:22.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
