This motel did not disappoint:\n1. Complimentary hotel shuttle to the airport.\n2. Complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was supposed to start at 6am but it was opened early around 5:30am given our hotel shuttle time.\n3. Good size rooms including 2 bedroom suite which we love.\n4. Awesome comfy bed with nice bed linens. This bed is on par with luxury hotel chains.\n5. Well maintained exterior - we've all seen your typical motel but this looks like you want to stay there.\nNot sure what else to say other than awesome value for the money.\nThe motel was located approx. 1 mile from the BART station so not too bad a walk after coming from downtown.\nIf you were staying for longer, there is a Safeway and Trader Joes down the street as well as lots of food options.\nRoom Tip: Choose one of the suites for extra space See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:34:06.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
