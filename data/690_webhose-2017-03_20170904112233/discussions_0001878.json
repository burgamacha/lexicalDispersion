It's a beautiful little \"gem\" of a hotel. The decor is over the top glitz but it works and it's beautiful. We loved our room that overlooked a small courtyard. If you want a Paris view, then this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a quiet room...and an extremely comfortable room...in the best location...for a reasonable price - this hotel cannot be beat. It's on a quiet side street right around the corner from all the outdoor cafes and bakeries. Lots of great options for meals without having to walk too far. Walking distance to almost all the main sites. And uber works great if you don't want to walk. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. And the shower was awesome! Very happy to have picked this hotel. We did remove the room air fragrance when we arrived and requested no fragrance, so if you are sensitive to fragrances you might want to request no room perfume prior to your arrival. There was a nespresso machine in our room, and hot tea too. LOVE this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:04:14.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
