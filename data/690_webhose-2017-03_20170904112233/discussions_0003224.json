Rooms are a bit small but clean comfortable. There are small bits needing a slight upgraded but this does not detract from our stay at all. We were there as a group of 6 for 3 nights. Staff were helpful.and a breakfast we always had a table for all 6 of us together even when other parties should of 6 were there. For me the only negative could only be given as a comparison with previous visits a number of years ago. When the owner was present for a chat in the morning telling you of sights to visit and putting a fresh basket of breads from\nthe baker across the road on our table. So the personal touch was missing. However if this had been our first visit we wouldn't know of this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:10:23.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
