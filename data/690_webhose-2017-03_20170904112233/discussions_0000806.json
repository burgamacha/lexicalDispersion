They worked hard to get us 3 rooms next to each other, making sure all our needs were taken care of. We chose to stay with the Residence Club access and it was well worth it. The club is very beautiful with excellent choices for appetizers, main dishes and drinks during happy hour. Breakfast was amazing downstairs, the best we have had in China. Location is perfect for seeing the sites, especially if you want to be close to the Forbidden City. Don't hesitate to ask for help finding your desired restaurant or tourist site, the concierge is always more than willing to print out directions and guide the taxi to the right location. We definitely will be staying here again next time we visit Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:26:14.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
