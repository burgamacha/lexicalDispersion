The kitchen was well equipped, the fold out couch was really comfy to sleep on. The views are spectacular, we could see the eiffel tower from our room! We walked to the Eiffel Tower, it was probably about a 20 min walk with a child, train stations are also quite close by. There are some nice places to eat a few blocks away, a supermarket a 5 min walk away and a pharmacy too.\nMy only complaint is the staff. If you need information get a brochure and figure it out yourself. You will save time, and you won't be left upset. On my whole holiday this was only hotel with rude staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:41:46.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
