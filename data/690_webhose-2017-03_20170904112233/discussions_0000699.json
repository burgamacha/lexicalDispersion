From the moment you walk in this place just hits you with charm. The staff was super accommodating and helpful. We needed a restaurant recommendation and Louie made reservations for us at an amazing little place down the street. Onto our room which we honestly had a difficult time leaving. We stayed in a junior suite (very affordable) that was decked out with character. Whether it was a stocked bookshelf, light up tiles in the shower, or furniture that looked like it belonged at Versailles, we couldn't help but feel like we were in our dream room. On top of all that, the location was about as convenient as possible for anything you'd want to do. Oh and free breakfast.
