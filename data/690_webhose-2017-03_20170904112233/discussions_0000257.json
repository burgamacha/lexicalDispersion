Especially Angel - his name says it all!\nFirst thing we did was have an amazing lunch at the hotel's restaurant (The Colony) which really made our trip begin in the tastiest way. The atmosphere, service and food made it a great addition to our stay. You have to try their sundae desert!!! Simply the best!\nThe hotel's location is ideal, and although only a few steps away from Selfridges, still quite and calm! Easy to walk everywhere, close to the tube, and with immediate taxi service.\nThe rooms spacious, clean, quite, with very comfortable beds. They also have a private bar which is only for hotel guests and is open 24/7\nBasically... definitely going back! Would strongly suggest it.", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:15:33.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
