There is a phone at SFO airport to call for the free shuttle service (same bus for Dylan hotel). Our OK room was near the pool area on the ground floor. The WiFi connection was very weak from the cheap router in the unit. The complimentary breakfast was very basic, toast, bagels and fruit. The distance to the Bart rail/metro system was a little farther walking distance that we thought, so we moved the following day to the Dylan that was 5 minutes away and had a better breakfast and was about the same price.\nRoom Tip: Perhaps rooms near lobby have better WiFi reception.
