Upon arrival I was immediately taken care of, the staff made me feel at home and gave me great advice as to what touristy things I could do. I more or less interacted with every member of staff (reception, 'bell boys') including the manager and I must say everyone was so friendly, helpful and really lovely. The location was also great. It was really easy getting to all the places I wanted to go from right outside the hotel using public transport. I would definitely recommend this hotel based on my personal experience. I would also definitely use this hotel again if i'm ever in Manhattan. Would just like to finish off by saying a big thanks to ALL the the staff at 'Marrakech hotel' for making my holiday all the more enjoyable, and for making feel so at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:17:11.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
