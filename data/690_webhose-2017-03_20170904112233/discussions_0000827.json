Just Love.\n1. Stone's throw from Roma Termini - Makes traveling by train to the airport so easy. (Great place to start & end your trip if you are traveling to other cities in between).\n2. Staff - great listeners, super helpful - directions, recommendations, preferences, etc.. lovely.\n3. Roof. - What can be wrong with a rooftop in Rome? Nada!\n4. Price has been great for the value that you get - best kept sorta secret.\n5. Breakfast - worth it, served in a pretty room, served by more nice staff, a fine selection of food.\nRoom Tip: maybe try to get a room that is a little bigger (but I haven't had a bad room) See more room tips", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:25:39.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
