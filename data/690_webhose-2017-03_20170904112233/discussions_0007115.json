Even though the hotel is in a great location near all the restaurants and bars, it was on a quiet street so no issues from a noise perspective. Staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable with luxurious slippers and nice dressing gowns. Complimentary bottles of water every day were welcome.\nCons - the rooms are very small, not sure if this is just rooms in Paris in general but this is literally the smallest room we have ever stayed in. We therefore didn't spend much \"down time\" lounging in the room. There wasn't room for a coffee machine etc which we would have liked especially as we didn't opt for breakfast. The hotel is quite pricey for the size of the room imo.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the hotel for location and comfort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:05:21.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
