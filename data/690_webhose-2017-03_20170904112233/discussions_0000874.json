We found this hotel nearby in a great location at a brilliant price that included breakfast. Located near the St Germain market (great for a rainy day wander and a glass of wine) and some of the best restaurants in Paris we much prefered this location than when we have previously stayed in hotels across the river.\nThe welcome at the Odeon Hotel was very warm and our room was ready before the official check in time which was a real bonus. The room (207) had quite a small double bed but we actually had a great night's sleep so can't fault it. The bath was a mini shower bath but fine for one night's stay and the shower pressure was excellent. The breakfast was simple but good quality and as you would expect in Paris the coffee was lovely!\nThanks Odeon Hotel, we will definitely recommend you to our friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:19:20.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
