Location, Location, Location....Awesome stay every visit. We have stayed in NYC 4 times, 3 times at the Warwick and we love the location, the rooms, the luxury space and the cleanliness. Nothing too much effort for the staff and always looked after with any request.\nWe enjoy luxury when we visit the states, and the Warwick has never let us down. Definitely a trusted location for you to enjoy the city as your central to the main attractions, a couple hundred yards from Central Park, round the corner from Top of the Rock, just up the block from Time Sq and as always an eye raising step from Starbucks!!! perfect for that morning wake-up before your adventures.\nWe have also stayed at their San Francisco Hotel, which is a bit more dated but just as friendly ansd welcoming.\nLook forward to returning\nSee all photos", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:41:30.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
