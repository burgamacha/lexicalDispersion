The staff are very friendly and professional too.\nI booked The Level room using cash plus my membership points and I also had a free upgrade from the membership account for my birthday.\nI got the room I wanted on the 17th floor and it was breathe-taking; you get to see the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and the rest of Paris. The room was very clean and the turn down service too was very good.\nThe hotel catered for everything I needed to make the proposal a success. Staying at the Level gave us access to drinks and tapas until 10.00 pm.\nVery close to a metro and it is not far from city center.\nRoom Tip: 1722 is the best room as it gives you the best view of paris.
