In Europe it's a little hard to find but for now Rome Glam Hotel is it. Location- check. Modern -check. New -check. Clean- check. Staff friendly- check. Complimentary breakfast -check. Location -unbelievable. Walked 2 blocks took a left and could see the colloseo. Metro stop Republica 8min walk and 15 min train ride to Vatican. Termini station 15 min walk or take republica one stop. Termini has express train to FCO every 10 min 15 euro. I think this hotel will hike up rates as the word gets out. We got it for less 150/night on one of the travel sites. Great hotel and great price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:34:57.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
