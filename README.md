<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

This is the code accompanying my medium post on lexical dispersion. 

## Usage

Feel free to utilize this cost to pull simple insights from text. This is a baby-step toward NLP, but still incredibly useful for answering stakeholder questions about THINGS (not topics) that people mention in posts. 

There is plenty of optimization to be done here. In practice, one thing I typically do is lemmatize my text and keywords, which increases the accuracy of identify bathroom issues based on all three of toilets, toilet, and toiletry (where my root word was just 'toilet').
